# FOUND FAMILY
## Household Structure & Dynamics
### Son of Cosmos: JumpChain

---

## THE CORE PREMISE

**Canon Tenchi Muyo:** Tenchi accumulates a harem of competing women.

**This Story:** Sheldon arrives 12 years early. When those women arrive, they find a family already in place. Competition becomes belonging. Harem becomes household.

---

## PRE-CANON HOUSEHOLD (Years 1-12)

### The Core Four

| Member | Role | Presence |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Katsuhito** | Patriarch, priest | Full-time |
| **Tenchi** | Child, center of gravity | Full-time |
| **Sheldon** | Caretaker, cook, uncle | Full-time |
| **Nobuyuki** | Father, provider | Weekends only |

### Daily Structure

**Weekdays:**
- Katsuhito: Shrine duties, training
- Tenchi: School (later years), play
- Sheldon: Cooking, housework, village errands
- Household feels complete

**Weekends:**
- Nobuyuki arrives Saturday morning
- Family meals together
- Father-son time (awkward but improving)
- Returns Sunday evening

### Emotional Architecture

```
        KATSUHITO
       /    |    \
      /     |     \
 mentor  trust   grandfather
    /       |         \
   /        |          \
SHELDON ─ care ─── TENCHI
    \                 /
     \               /
    awkward      absent
        \           /
         \         /
         NOBUYUKI
```

### What Makes It Work
- **Katsuhito:** Provides stability, history, authority
- **Sheldon:** Provides warmth, daily care, emotional presence
- **Nobuyuki:** Provides legal parenthood, financial support
- **Tenchi:** Provides purpose for all three adults

## THE TRANSFORMATION (Year 13)

### What Canon Events Do

**Summer 2001:**
- Tenchi releases Ryoko
- Within weeks/months: Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, Washu arrive
- In canon: Romantic chaos
- In this story: Family expansion

### Why It's Different

**In Canon:** Tenchi is an isolated teenager, starved for connection, overwhelmed by sudden female attention.

**In This Story:** Tenchi is secure, loved, confident. He has:
- ✓ Grandfather (Katsuhito)
- ✓ Father figure (Sheldon)
- ✓ Father (Nobuyuki)
- ✓ Years of emotional stability

He doesn't NEED romantic validation. So the women become family instead of competitors.

## CHARACTER ROLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### Ryoko
| Canon Role | Found Family Role |
|------------|-------------------|
| Romantic rival | Chaotic aunt |
| Aggressive pursuer | Protective family member |
| Jealous lover | Loyal household defender |
| Tsundere love interest | Honest about feelings (eventually) |

**Why:** Sheldon's presence from Year 1 means Tenchi doesn't fit her romantic narrative. She finds something better: unconditional acceptance.

### Ayeka
| Canon Role | Found Family Role |
|------------|-------------------|
| Romantic rival | Proper aunt |
| Formal princess | Family diplomat |
| Competition with Ryoko | Sisterhood with Ryoko |
| Tenchi-obsessed | Family-oriented |

**Why:** Finding Yosho alive and partnered shifts her priorities. She came for a fiancé; she found a family.

### Sasami
| Canon Role | Found Family Role |
|------------|-------------------|
| Little sister | Youngest sister |
| Tsunami vessel | Still Tsunami vessel |
| Cook | Sheldon's kitchen assistant |
| Support character | Beloved center |

**Why:** Minimal change—she was always family-oriented. Now has Sheldon as cooking mentor.

### Washu
| Canon Role | Found Family Role |
|------------|-------------------|
| Mad scientist | Mad scientist grandmother |
| Chaos agent | Chaos agent (affectionate) |
| Ryoko's mother | Acknowledged mother |
| Isolated genius | Household member |

**Why:** Sheldon's Lambda signature is the most interesting thing she's studied in millennia. She stays for the mystery; she stays for the family.

### Mihoshi
| Canon Role | Found Family Role |
|------------|-------------------|
| Accident-prone officer | Accident-prone family friend |
| Comic relief | Comic relief (beloved) |
| Luck manipulator | Luck manipulator |

**Why:** Minimal change—she was always accepted. Now formally family.

### For Sheldon
- Purpose after death
- Connection after isolation
- Home after displacement
- Love after loneliness

### For Yosho
- End to 700 years of solitude

- Family restored
- Future with meaning

### For the Arrivals
- Belonging without conditions

## THE THESIS

"Found family" means:
- You don't have to be born into it
- You don't have to earn it
- You just have to show up
- And keep showing up
- And let others do the same

Sheldon arrived with nothing.
Tenchi was a lonely child.
Yosho had waited 700 years.
The women crashed into chaos.

They built a family anyway.
