# IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

## Option A: Sequential Expansion
- Day 2 fully expanded (all POVs)
- Verify worldbuilding coherence
- Proceed to Day 3
- Continue through Day 28

## Option B: POV Layer Approach
- Expand all Sheldon POV first (Days 2-28)
- Then all Katsuhito POV
- Then all Tenchi POV
- Integrate chronologically

## Option C: Week-Based Chunks
- Week 1 (Days 2-7) fully expanded
- Verify, integrate, correct
- Week 2, Week 3, Week 4

---

# STORY BIBLE INTEGRATION

Every expansion session MUST generate:
1. **Character Stubs** for any new NPC
2. **Location Profiles** for any new setting
3. **Plot Thread Notes** for any seeded element
4. **Continuity Flags** for any event that affects later scenes

This ensures the "organic worldbuilding through scene density" actually captures everything.

---

# ESTIMATED OUTPUT

## Per Day Fully Expanded:
- 897+ scenes minimum
- ~90,000-120,000 words per day
- 20-50 new worldbuilding elements

## Chapter 1 Complete:
- ~24,000+ scenes
- ~2.5-3 million words
- 500+ NPCs introduced
- 100+ locations detailed
- 200+ plot threads seeded

# READY TO BEGIN?

Select starting point:
- [ ] Day 2 Sequential (Sheldon → Katsuhito → Tenchi)
