# DAY 24 — DEPARTURE
## April 26, 1989 (Wednesday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Shrine (breakfast/farewell) → Village (bus stop) → Tsukino House (work) → Shrine (dinner)  
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 20°C high, 11°C low, mild spring day  
**Sunrise:** 5:18 AM | **Sunset:** 6:46 PM

---

## SCENE 1: DEPARTURE DAY
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The day of leaving carried its own weight.

Sheldon woke knowing that today would shift the shrine's composition—one fewer adult, one father returning to distant Tokyo, one boy facing the gap between visits. The mathematics of family attendance mattered to children in ways adults sometimes forgot.

Twenty-four days since awakening. Nobuyuki's departure day.

---

## SCENE 2: EARLY ARRIVAL
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, entrance

The shrine showed signs of early morning activity.

Nobuyuki's suitcase waited by the entrance, packed and ready. The architect himself stood on the engawa, coffee cup in hand, watching the sunrise paint the mountain in colors that Tokyo's skyline couldn't match.

"Couldn't sleep," he said when Sheldon approached. "Always happens before I leave. My body knows the transition is coming."

"How early is your train?"

"The bus at eight. Train from the village station at eight-forty. Express from Okayama at noon. Tokyo by four." The itinerary emerged with practiced familiarity. "I've made this journey often enough that my body knows the schedule even when my mind doesn't."

---

## SCENE 3: FAREWELL BREAKFAST
**Time:** 07:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

Breakfast proceeded with muted energy.

Tenchi ate slowly, each bite extending time, as if eating could delay what he couldn't prevent. Nobuyuki ate steadily, fuel for the journey ahead. Katsuhito ate as always—measured, calm, the anchor point around which emotions swirled without capsizing.

"I'll call tonight," Nobuyuki said. "From the apartment. So you'll know I arrived safely."

"I know you'll arrive safely," Tenchi said.

"Then I'll call so I can hear your voice. Is that acceptable?"

The boy nodded, unable to argue against his father wanting connection.

---

## SCENE 4: SECOND LESSON
**Time:** 07:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, training ground

Katsuhito conducted Tenchi's second lesson while Nobuyuki watched from the engawa.

Today: bowing. The ritual of respect that preceded all martial interaction. Tenchi bent at the waist with five-year-old approximation, his form rough but his intention sincere.

"Lower," Katsuhito said. "A bow is not a nod. It is a commitment of vulnerability. When you bow, you cannot see your opponent. You trust that they will honor the ritual as you honor it."

"What if they don't?"

"Then you learn about their character. But the learning costs you nothing. The bow reveals them, not you."

---

## SCENE 5: WATCHING THE LESSON
**Time:** 08:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

"He's patient with him," Nobuyuki observed quietly.

"Patient teachers create patient students."

"That was always my fear—that Tenchi would inherit my impatience. That he'd want results before he'd earned them." Nobuyuki watched his son practice bowing, the repetition building muscle memory. "But Father has always been able to slow things down. To make waiting feel like doing."

"A valuable skill."

"One I never learned." The admission carried no self-pity. "I build buildings. Schedules, deadlines, contractors demanding answers yesterday. Patience in my world is a luxury I can't afford."

---

## SCENE 6: FINAL GOODBYE
**Time:** 08:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, entrance

The moment arrived with unavoidable clarity.

Nobuyuki knelt to his son's height, hands on small shoulders, eyes meeting eyes. "Twelve days. Golden Week. I'll be back before you've finished learning to hold the sword properly."

"Promise?"

"Promise." The word carried contract weight. "When have I ever broken a promise to you?"

Tenchi considered this with the seriousness the question deserved. "Never."

"Then trust that pattern to continue. Twelve days. Count them if you need to."

"I'll count them." The boy's voice steadied with the task. "Every day until you come back."

---

## SCENE 7: WALK TO BUS
**Time:** 08:25:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to village

Sheldon accompanied Nobuyuki down the mountain.

The suitcase wheels caught on roots and stones, requiring periodic lifting over obstacles. The pace was slower than the path demanded, as if the descent itself resisted the separation it facilitated.

"Remember what I asked," Nobuyuki said as they walked. "About watching."

"I remember."

"Don't investigate. Don't probe. Just observe. Notice what my father doesn't say as much as what he does say. Notice what Tenchi learns that wasn't explicitly taught."

"You make it sound like a mystery."

"Maybe it is. Or maybe I'm paranoid from too many years of not understanding my own family." A slight smile. "Either way, you're the eyes I don't have here. Use them wisely."

---

## SCENE 8: BUS STOP FAREWELL
**Time:** 08:40:00 JST  
**Location:** Village center, bus stop

The bus arrived with rural punctuality.

"Thank you," Nobuyuki said, extending his hand. "For walking me. For everything."

"I didn't do much."

"You did enough." The handshake carried weight beyond its physical contact. "Take care of my son. Take care of my father, even though he doesn't think he needs care. Take care of yourself."

"I'll try."

"Trying is enough." Nobuyuki boarded the bus, suitcase stowed, window seat selected. He waved once as the bus pulled away, the gesture carrying finality even as it promised return.

---

## SCENE 9: RETURN WALK
**Time:** 09:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Village to Tsukino House

The walk back felt different without the architect's presence.

Sheldon took the path to his house rather than the shrine, needing the transition time between departure and resumption of ordinary activities. The morning carried a particular quiet—not emptiness, but the space where presence had recently been.

*Departure creates room*, Dorothy Mae's voice observed. *The question is what fills the space left behind.*

---

## SCENE 10: HOUSE WORK
**Time:** 09:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Work resumed with Takeshi's arrival.

The day's tasks focused on exterior finishing—weather sealing for the restored sections, preparation of surfaces that would receive treatment in coming weeks. The work was methodical, requiring attention without demanding intensity.

"Nobuyuki-san departed?" Takeshi asked.

"This morning's bus."

"He visits more often than some fathers I know. The distance is inconvenient, but his intention is clear."

"His intention?"

"To remain present despite absence. Some parents give up. Others maintain effort." Takeshi applied sealant with practiced strokes. "The effort itself is the message, even when presence is impossible."

---

## SCENE 11: MIDDAY BREAK
**Time:** 12:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Lunch was simple—rice balls from morning preparation, pickles, tea.

Takeshi ate with the appetite of physical labor, his portions reflecting the morning's exertion. The conversation wandered through work topics—sealing compounds, weather predictions, the timeline for remaining tasks.

"The house could be fully complete by June," Takeshi said. "If the roof holds and no new surprises emerge."

"That seems optimistic."

"Optimism is how houses get finished. Pessimism is how they stay unfinished." A slight smile. "My uncle says every house is a collaboration between intention and reality. Reality always wins, but intention determines how gracefully you accept the loss."

---

## SCENE 12: AFTERNOON WORK
**Time:** 13:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

The afternoon continued exterior work in increasingly warm weather.

Sheldon's hands grew confident with the sealing techniques—application, spreading, checking for gaps, reapplication where needed. The work was meditative, requiring enough attention to prevent errors but not enough to prevent thought.

*Watch my son. Father has plans.*

Nobuyuki's words returned unbidden. What plans? What purposes? The priest had shown nothing but kindness, yet the architect's warning suggested depths beneath the surface that Sheldon hadn't perceived.

---

## SCENE 13: SHRINE VISIT
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, entrance

The afternoon's work complete, Sheldon walked up to the shrine.

The grounds showed no visible change from Nobuyuki's departure—the same paths, the same buildings, the same mountain presence surrounding everything. But the absence registered in smaller ways: the empty place at the dining table, the missing voice in conversation, the particular quiet that followed when someone who had been present was present no longer.

Tenchi met him at the gate with residual solemnity, his morning energy subdued by his father's departure.

"Tou-san left."

"I know. I walked him to the bus."

"I wanted to walk him too. But ojii-chan said I needed to practice my lessons."

"The lessons are important."

"I know." The acknowledgment carried weight beyond its words. "Everything is important. That's what ojii-chan says. Even the boring parts."

---

## SCENE 14: AFTERNOON PRACTICE
**Time:** 16:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, training ground

Tenchi demonstrated his bowing to Sheldon with the pride of new accomplishment.

"Lower," he instructed himself, echoing his grandfather's words. "Commitment of vul-ner-ability." The word emerged in careful syllables. "That means letting yourself be hit if they're bad."

"Close enough."

"I'm good at bowing now. Tomorrow I learn gripping." The wooden sword lay beside him, still unused, its potential still waiting. "Ojii-chan says gripping is harder than standing or bowing."

"Everything seems harder before you learn it."

"That's what tou-san said too. Before he left."

---

## SCENE 15: DINNER
**Time:** 18:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

Dinner at the shrine felt different without Nobuyuki.

Three people where four had been. The conversation found its new rhythm, adjusting to the changed composition. Katsuhito spoke more, filling spaces the architect had occupied. Tenchi spoke less, his energy still processing the departure.

"He'll call tonight," Katsuhito reminded.

"I know." Tenchi poked at his rice. "Calling isn't the same as being here."

"No. It isn't. But connection through distance is still connection."

---

## SCENE 16: PHONE CALL
**Time:** 19:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, office

The phone rang with Tokyo's distinct crackle.

Sheldon heard the conversation through the office's thin walls—Tenchi's excited questions, Nobuyuki's patient answers, the particular cadence of long-distance communication constrained by cost and time. The call lasted perhaps ten minutes, but its impact would sustain the boy through coming days.

"He arrived safely," Tenchi reported afterward. "His apartment is messy because he wasn't there to clean it. He's going to order food because he's too tired to cook."

"That sounds typical."

"Adults are weird. Who's too tired to cook?"

"Adults who've traveled all day. Your turn will come."

---

## SCENE 17: EVENING CALM
**Time:** 20:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

The evening settled into post-departure normalcy.

Katsuhito and Sheldon sat on the engawa while Tenchi prepared for bed, the day's emotions having worn him into unusual compliance with bedtime protocols. The stars emerged through scattered clouds, the mountain's nighttime sounds providing backdrop.

"He asked you to watch," Katsuhito said without preamble.

"Yes."

"I thought he might. He's always suspected I have secrets." The priest's voice carried mild amusement. "He's not wrong. But his suspicions are pointed in the wrong direction."

"What direction should they be pointed?"

"That's not a conversation for tonight. Tonight is for recovering from departure, for allowing routine to reassert itself." Katsuhito rose with the deliberate movement of advancing age. "Nobuyuki worries because worrying is his nature. What he should worry about has nothing to do with wooden swords or training regimens."

---

## SCENE 18: WALK HOME
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to Tsukino House

The path home carried new questions.

Katsuhito's response to Nobuyuki's warning had been neither denial nor confirmation—something more oblique, suggesting that the architect's suspicions were accurate but misdirected. Secrets existed. But their nature remained unclear.

*Watch. Pay attention. Notice what isn't said.*

Sheldon walked through darkness with accumulating mysteries. The mountain kept its secrets. The priest acknowledged having them. The father worried about their impact on his son.

And Sheldon stood between them all, watching, as he'd been asked to do.

---

## SCENE 19: HOME
**Time:** 20:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The house welcomed him with its reliable silence.

Twenty-four days since awakening. The household's composition had shifted—one fewer adult at the shrine, the weekend visit concluded, the ordinary rhythms resuming their ordinary patterns. Tomorrow would bring more work, more lessons, more of the gradual building that defined this period.

Sheldon prepared for sleep with the efficiency of established routine, his mind still processing the day's departures and revelations.

---

## SCENE 20: FINAL THOUGHTS
**Time:** 21:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The ceiling held no answers.

But tonight Sheldon had questions to keep the darkness company. What secrets did Katsuhito keep? What should Nobuyuki worry about, if not the obvious? What depths existed beneath the shrine's peaceful surface?

*Questions lead to answers*, he thought. *But answers lead to more questions. The process never ends.*

Sleep arrived carrying mysteries. Tomorrow would bring Day 25, and the questions would remain, waiting for their eventual revelations.
