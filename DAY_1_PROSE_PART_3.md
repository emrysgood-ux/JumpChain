### Part 3: Scenes 101-150

**POV:** Sheldon (exclusive)  
**Timeline:** 15:31:29 JST — 16:15:00 JST  
**Coverage:** Bus Ride → Village Arrival → Beginning of Ascent

---

## SCENE 101
**Time:** 15:32:46 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

The bus rounded a curve, and the landscape shifted.

The flat agricultural valley gave way to rising terrain. Hills pressed closer to the road, their slopes covered in the mixed forest of cedar and deciduous growth. The paddies disappeared, replaced by terraced plots too small for rice—vegetable gardens, perhaps, or orchards in their pre-bloom state.

They were climbing. Not steeply, but steadily. Toward higher ground.

---

## SCENE 102
**Time:** 15:33:57 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

A stop. The bus slowed, stopped, opened its doors.

The farmer in work clothes rose and exited, nodding to the driver as he descended. No one boarded. The doors closed. The bus resumed motion.

He watched the farmer recede through the rear window—a figure in brown clothes walking toward a house that looked older than any building should look and still stand.

---

## SCENE 103
**Time:** 15:35:12 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

The schoolgirl exited at the next stop.

She'd been absorbed in a book for the entire ride, her bag tucked against the window, her attention turned entirely inward. Now she gathered her things and left without looking back, disappearing into the late afternoon like someone who belonged here absolutely.

Three passengers remained. The elderly woman. The sleeping man. Himself.

---

## SCENE 104
**Time:** 15:36:28 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

The road narrowed.

What had been two adequate lanes became one and a half, then one, the pavement barely wide enough for the bus to pass. Vegetation pressed closer from both sides—branches occasionally scraping the roof, leaves brushing the windows.

The driver handled the narrow passage with the competence of long practice. He'd driven this route before. Many times.

---

## SCENE 105
**Time:** 15:37:44 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

Through a gap in the trees, he caught sight of something below.

Water. A lake, glimpsed and gone in an instant. The color had been deep blue-green, the surface still, the edges obscured by forest. Large, from what he could tell. A natural lake in the mountains.

The bus continued climbing. The lake disappeared behind the terrain.

---

## SCENE 106
**Time:** 15:38:59 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

The elderly man woke.

He blinked, oriented himself, looked out the window with the particular attention of someone tracking their position. His stop must be approaching. He gathered a small cloth bag from beneath his seat and moved toward the front of the bus.

The driver said something too quiet to hear. The man responded. Both of them laughed at some private joke.

---

## SCENE 107
**Time:** 15:40:15 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

Another stop. The elderly man exited.

Only two passengers remained now. The woman who had recognized his mother's name. Himself.

She caught his eye and smiled—the particular smile of someone about to share information.

"Next stop," she said. "Jinja-mae. Shrine-front. Your stop."

---

## SCENE 108
**Time:** 15:41:31 JST  
**Location:** Bus, approaching final stop

The trees thinned. Light returned to the road.

He could see it now—the torii gate, rising from a small clearing beside the road. Vermillion wood against green forest, the classic shape announcing the presence of sacred ground. Beyond the gate, stone steps ascending into shadow.

The shrine. His destination.

His stop.

---

## SCENE 109
**Time:** 15:42:47 JST  
**Location:** Bus, final stop

The bus stopped with a settling of brakes and hydraulics.

The driver turned in his seat—the first time he'd really looked at the foreign passenger. His expression was neutral, professional, but something in his eyes suggested curiosity.

"Jinja-mae," he announced. "Last stop."

---

## SCENE 110
**Time:** 15:43:02 JST  
**Location:** Bus, preparing to exit

The elderly woman rose first.

She moved toward the door with the careful deliberation of age, her walking stick finding purchase on the bus floor. At the door, she paused and looked back at him.

"Tell Katsuhito-san that Yamamoto Haruko sends her regards."

Yamamoto Haruko. He committed the name to memory.

"I will. Thank you for your help."

---

## SCENE 111
**Time:** 15:43:19 JST  
**Location:** Bus, exiting

He followed her out into the afternoon light.

The air outside the bus was cleaner than inside—forest air, mountain air, carrying the particular oxygen-rich freshness of elevation and vegetation. He breathed deeply without thinking about it, his lungs expanding to capacity without complaint.

The bus doors closed behind him. The engine revved. The vehicle pulled away, heading east on whatever loop would eventually bring it back.

---

## SCENE 112
**Time:** 15:43:36 JST  
**Location:** Shrine entrance, roadside

He stood before the torii gate.

The structure was larger than it had appeared from the bus—the crossbeam easily ten meters above the ground, the pillars thick enough that he couldn't have wrapped his arms around them. The vermillion paint had faded with age but retained its fundamental color, the red that marked the boundary between ordinary and sacred.

---

## SCENE 113
**Time:** 15:43:53 JST  
**Location:** Shrine entrance, roadside

Yamamoto Haruko departed without ceremony.

She took a path that diverged from the shrine entrance, heading toward a cluster of houses visible through a gap in the trees. A village, small but present. People lived here, near this shrine, in the shadow of whatever mountain rose above.

He was alone.

---

## SCENE 114
**Time:** 15:44:10 JST  
**Location:** Before the torii gate

He approached the gate slowly.

Not from reverence—not yet—but from caution. Whatever waited beyond this boundary had been placed in his path deliberately. The field, the documents, the bus route that terminated here. None of this was accidental.

Someone had wanted him at this shrine. He was about to find out why.

---

## SCENE 115
**Time:** 15:44:27 JST  
**Location:** Before the torii gate

At the gate's base, he paused to observe the ground.

A gravel path began here, raked into neat patterns that suggested regular maintenance. Stone lanterns lined the path at intervals, their surfaces weathered but clean. The forest pressed close on either side, but the path itself remained clear.

Beyond the gate, steps. He could see the first dozen from where he stood, climbing steeply into forest shadow.

---

## SCENE 116
**Time:** 15:44:44 JST  
**Location:** Passing through torii gate

He stepped through the gate.

The air changed. Or perhaps he imagined that it changed—the particular stillness of moving from secular to sacred space, the psychological weight of boundaries even when nothing physical blocked the way.

He didn't imagine the temperature drop. The forest shade was cooler than the open road. Significantly cooler.

---

## SCENE 117
**Time:** 15:45:01 JST  
**Location:** Just inside torii gate

The temizu-ya stood to his right.

A small pavilion sheltering a stone basin, water flowing from a dragon-shaped spout into the reservoir below. Bamboo ladles hung from hooks, waiting for hands to lift them.

He knew what to do here. The protocol had been drilled into him during summers in Kyoto, practiced until the movements became automatic.

---

## SCENE 118
**Time:** 15:45:18 JST  
**Location:** Temizu-ya (purification fountain)

He approached the basin and selected a ladle.

The bamboo was smooth from use, worn to a satin finish by generations of pilgrims. He filled the ladle from the dragon's stream, letting the cold water settle.

Left hand first. He poured water over his left hand, letting the runoff fall into the drainage channel below the basin.

---

## SCENE 119
**Time:** 15:45:35 JST  
**Location:** Temizu-ya (purification fountain)

Right hand next.

He transferred the ladle and repeated the process, cold water washing over his palm and fingers. The water came from somewhere above—spring-fed, probably, carried down from the mountain through channels he couldn't see.

His hands tingled with the cold. Clean. Purified, if such things were possible.

---

## SCENE 120
**Time:** 15:45:52 JST  
**Location:** Temizu-ya (purification fountain)

The mouth was last.

He cupped water in his left hand, brought it to his lips, rinsed without swallowing. The water tasted of minerals and mountain—a taste that seemed older than the basin that held it.

Finally, he tilted the ladle to let remaining water run down the handle, cleaning the tool for the next visitor.

---

## SCENE 121
**Time:** 15:46:09 JST  
**Location:** Temizu-ya (purification fountain)

He replaced the ladle on its hook.

The ritual complete, he stood for a moment before the basin. The dragon continued to pour water in its eternal loop, the sound filling the forest silence. Behind him, the road and the ordinary world. Before him, the steps and whatever waited above.

Dorothy Mae would have approved of the ritual. She'd always insisted on proper preparation before difficult tasks.

---

## SCENE 122
**Time:** 15:46:26 JST  
**Location:** Base of shrine steps

He turned to face the stairs.

They rose before him in a long, steep ascent. Stone steps, worn smooth at their centers from centuries of feet. The flight disappeared into forest shadow approximately a third of the way up, emerging—presumably—at the shrine grounds above.

He counted what he could see. Thirty steps. Forty. The shadows swallowed the rest.

---

## SCENE 123
**Time:** 15:46:43 JST  
**Location:** Base of shrine steps

How many in total?

The question felt important. Not for practical reasons—he would climb them all regardless of the count—but as a way of measuring this place, of understanding its scale.

He started climbing. He would count as he went.

---

## SCENE 124
**Time:** 15:47:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, beginning ascent

One. Two. Three.

The steps were steep. Higher than typical stairs, forcing his legs to lift with each stride. The stone was dry despite the forest shade, textured enough to provide grip.

Four. Five. Six.

His body handled the incline without complaint. Lungs expanded. Heart pumped. Muscles engaged and released in proper sequence.

---

## SCENE 125
**Time:** 15:47:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, early ascent

Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two.

The torii gate was already below him, visible through gaps in the forest canopy. The road beyond it seemed distant, part of a world he was leaving behind with each step.

Twenty-three. Twenty-four. Twenty-five.

The forest closed around him. Cedar branches overhead filtered the sunlight to green-gold shafts that moved with the breeze.

---

## SCENE 126
**Time:** 15:47:34 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, early ascent

Fifty.

A small landing broke the continuous climb. He paused here, not from exhaustion but from habit—his old body would have needed this rest. His new one did not, but the pause gave him time to observe.

A stone lantern stood beside the landing, its sides carved with characters worn too smooth to read. Old. Very old. As old as the steps themselves, perhaps older.

---

## SCENE 127
**Time:** 15:47:51 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, first landing

The forest sounds had changed.

The road noise was gone—no cars, no distant engines. Only birds, wind, and the particular silence of places where human activity rarely reached. The uguisu called somewhere above him, its three-note song echoing between the trees.

He resumed climbing.

---

## SCENE 128
**Time:** 15:48:08 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

Seventy-five. Seventy-six. Seventy-seven.

His breathing had deepened but remained controlled. His heart rate had elevated but stayed regular. The climb was exercise, not punishment.

He remembered similar climbs with his old body—the burning thighs, the labored breath, the need to stop every hundred feet and let his heart recover. None of that now. Just steady progress upward.

---

## SCENE 129
**Time:** 15:48:25 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

One hundred.

Another landing. Another lantern. Another pause he didn't strictly need.

The view behind him had opened slightly—he could see forest descending toward the valley, the glint of the lake he'd glimpsed from the bus. The village below was invisible, hidden by the trees.

Above, the steps continued. Many more. He hadn't reached the halfway point.

---

## SCENE 130
**Time:** 15:48:42 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, second landing

He checked his watch. 15:48.

Three minutes since he'd started climbing. A hundred steps in three minutes. If the rate held, and if his estimate of total steps was accurate, he had perhaps ten more minutes of climbing ahead.

He continued.

---

## SCENE 131
**Time:** 15:48:59 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

One twenty-five. One twenty-six. One twenty-seven.

The stone beneath his feet had changed color. Darker here, perhaps from moisture retention in the deeper shade. Moss grew at the edges, bright green against gray, marking the boundary between used and unused.

One twenty-eight. One twenty-nine. One thirty.

---

## SCENE 132
**Time:** 15:49:16 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

The steps curved slightly to the right.

He followed the curve, his count continuing. The forest canopy shifted as the path turned, admitting different light, revealing different trees. A massive cedar stood beside the steps—trunk wide enough for ten men to circle, bark furrowed with the texture of great age.

The tree had seen centuries pass. Would see centuries more.

---

## SCENE 133
**Time:** 15:49:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

One fifty.

Halfway, perhaps. Or close to it. His legs had found their rhythm now, the repetitive motion of climbing settling into automatic pattern.

The air smelled different this high up. Colder. Cleaner. Carrying hints of incense from somewhere above—sandalwood, maybe. The presence of the shrine announcing itself through scent before sight.

---

## SCENE 134
**Time:** 15:49:50 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

One seventy-five.

The steps leveled briefly—a long landing rather than a resting point. He crossed it without slowing, his momentum carrying him toward the next flight.

A torii gate appeared ahead, smaller than the one below but equally vermillion. The second gate. Marking another boundary, another threshold.

---

## SCENE 135
**Time:** 15:50:07 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, second torii gate

He passed through the second gate.

The sensation of crossing recurred—that subtle shift that might have been psychological or might have been something else entirely. The air seemed to thicken slightly. The sounds of the forest seemed to recede.

Or he was tired, and his mind was playing tricks.

He continued climbing.

---

## SCENE 136
**Time:** 15:50:24 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

Two hundred.

His thighs were burning now. Not badly—not the sharp protest his old body would have registered—but noticeably. The climb was work. His new body was capable of work, but work still had a cost.

Twenty more steps. The burning increased.

Twenty-five. Thirty.

Two thirty.

---

## SCENE 137
**Time:** 15:50:41 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, continued ascent

Light ahead.

The forest canopy was thinning. He could see sky through the gaps—blue, clear, the afternoon still bright despite the hour. The steps continued but their angle decreased. The climb was easing.

Two fifty. Two fifty-five. Two sixty.

---

## SCENE 138
**Time:** 15:50:58 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, upper section

The trees fell away.

He emerged from the forest shadow into open air, the final section of steps rising before him in full sunlight. Above, he could see buildings—traditional structures with curved roofs, wooden construction, the distinctive architecture of Shinto sacred space.

The shrine. He was almost there.

---

## SCENE 139
**Time:** 15:51:15 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, upper section

Two eighty. Two eighty-five. Two ninety.

The incense smell was stronger here, mixing with other scents—wood smoke, wet stone, something floral he couldn't identify. The sounds changed too. He could hear wind chimes somewhere above, their notes carrying on the breeze.

Two ninety-five. Two ninety-six.

---

## SCENE 140
**Time:** 15:51:32 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, approaching top

Three hundred.

A third landing, larger than the others. Stone benches here, positioned for pilgrims who needed rest before the final push. He didn't need rest, but he paused anyway.

Twenty steps remained. He could see them clearly now—the final flight ascending to a large torii gate that marked the shrine grounds proper.

---

## SCENE 141
**Time:** 15:51:49 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, third landing

He caught his breath.

Not because he needed to—his lungs were functioning perfectly, his heart already slowing from the climb—but because arriving mattered. Whatever waited at the top had shaped everything that came before: the field, the documents, the identity, the bus route that terminated here.

He would arrive composed. Ready. Present.

---

## SCENE 142
**Time:** 15:52:06 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, final section

Twenty steps.

He climbed them deliberately, each one a conscious choice. The stone here was different—newer, perhaps, or better maintained. The edges were sharper, the surfaces less worn.

Fifteen steps. Ten. Five.

---

## SCENE 143
**Time:** 15:52:23 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps, final step

Three hundred and twenty.

He stepped through the final torii gate and onto level ground.

Three hundred and twenty steps. Not three hundred, not three fifty. Three hundred and twenty exactly. He filed the number away, another piece of data about this place.

---

## SCENE 144
**Time:** 15:52:40 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, initial arrival

The shrine grounds opened before him.

He stood at the edge of a clearing, perhaps fifty meters across. Traditional buildings lined the perimeter—a main hall directly ahead, smaller structures to either side. Stone paths connected the buildings, bordered by carefully maintained gravel.

Everything was clean. Ordered. Maintained with obvious care.

---

## SCENE 145
**Time:** 15:52:57 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, initial arrival

The main hall dominated his attention.

Two stories, traditional construction, sweeping rooflines covered in gray tile. The entrance was elevated—wooden platform, protective overhang, offerings box visible near the door. The building had weight, presence, the particular solidity of structures built to last centuries.

He was expected here. He felt certain of that now.

---

## SCENE 146
**Time:** 15:53:14 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, observing

No one was visible.

The grounds appeared empty—no priests, no visitors, no signs of recent activity beyond the careful maintenance. Wind chimes rang somewhere out of sight. A crow called from the forest edge.

He was alone. Or appeared to be.

---

## SCENE 147
**Time:** 15:53:31 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, waiting

He stood still and waited.

Not from indecision—from respect. This was someone's home, someone's workplace, someone's sacred charge. Yamamoto Haruko had mentioned Masaki Katsuhito. The shrine keeper. The one who would know of his return.

He would not barge into that person's space uninvited.

---

## SCENE 148
**Time:** 15:53:48 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, waiting

A door opened.

Sound carried clearly in the quiet—the slide of wood on wood, the particular friction of traditional Japanese construction. He turned toward the sound and found a figure emerging from one of the smaller buildings.

An old man. Gray hair pulled back in a ponytail. Round glasses. Traditional clothing.

Masaki Katsuhito, he presumed.

---

## SCENE 149
**Time:** 15:54:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, first sighting of Katsuhito

The old man walked with deliberate care.

Not the shuffling gait of infirmity—something else. A chosen slowness, as if each step mattered, as if the act of moving across his own shrine grounds required and deserved attention.

He was heading toward the main hall. He hadn't yet noticed the visitor standing at the edge of the clearing.

---

## SCENE 150
**Time:** 15:54:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, waiting to be noticed

He cleared his throat.

Not loudly—just enough to announce his presence without shouting across sacred ground. A small sound, carrying clearly in the afternoon stillness.

The old man stopped. Turned. Looked directly at him through those round glasses.

Their eyes met across the shrine grounds.

Neither of them moved.
