# AYEKA ARRIVAL FRAMEWORK
## Son of Cosmos: Year 13 — The Romantic Collapse
## The Pivot Point for "Aunt" Dynamic

---

# SCENE CONTEXT

**Date:** Summer 2001 (Year 13), approximately 1-2 weeks after Ryoko's release
**Ayeka's Status:** First Princess of Jurai, ~720 years old (20 physical), engaged to Yosho
**Sasami's Status:** Second Princess, ~708 years old (8 physical), stowaway, contains Tsunami
**Setting:** Earth orbit → Masaki Shrine area → Masaki household

---

# PART 1: AYEKA'S CANONICAL EXPECTATIONS

## 1.1 — What She Expected to Find

**Most Likely Scenario (in her mind):**
- Yosho dead (700 years is a long time, even for Juraians)
- His tree Funaho-no-ki either dead or dormant
- Closure on her engagement

**Best Case Scenario (her hope):**
- Yosho alive
- Would fulfill his promise to return
- Could finally marry him

**Her Emotional State:**
- 700 years of suspended animation searching
- Genuine love for Yosho (one-sided; he saw her as sister)
- Dyed her hair purple to attract him
- Built her identity around being "Yosho's future wife"

## 1.2 — Why Yosho Left (Canon)

**Official Reason:** Pursuing Ryoko to protect Jurai
**Real Reason:** Escape from prejudice

Yosho was half-human (mother Funaho was Earth-born). Despite being First Prince with a 1st Generation tree, he suffered discrimination on Jurai. Ryoko's attack gave him an excuse to leave and never return.

**What He Told Ayeka:** "I'll return and we'll marry."
**What He Actually Did:** Stayed on Earth, married an Earth woman (Itsuki), had descendants, never contacted Jurai.

## 1.3 — The Betrayal She Doesn't Know About

Yosho broke his promise deliberately. He:
- Never intended to return
- Let Ayeka wait 700 years
- Built an entire life without her
- Had children with another woman

This is already a betrayal in canon. Our version adds another layer.

---

# PART 2: WHAT SHE ACTUALLY FINDS (OUR VERSION)

## 2.1 — The Trigger

Ayeka's ship detects Ryoko's life signs (same as canon). She tracks to Earth expecting to find:
- Evidence of Yosho's battle
- Possibly Yosho's remains
- The demon who "took" her fiancé

Instead she finds:
- Ryoko alive and free
- A human boy (Tenchi) who activated Tenchi-ken
- A shrine maintained by "Katsuhito"
- An established household

## 2.2 — The Revelation Sequence

**Phase 1: Arrival & Conflict (Same as Canon)**
- Ryu-Oh vs Ryo-Ohki space battle
- Both ships damaged
- Crash/forced landing near shrine
- Initial hostility with Ryoko
- Meets Tenchi

**Phase 2: Meeting the Household**
- Encounters Katsuhito (Yosho in disguise)
- Senses something familiar about him
- Meets Sheldon — notes he's living there
- Registers as "odd" but not immediately significant

**Phase 3: The Yosho Revelation**
Canon timing: During Kagato arc
Our version: May be earlier OR same timing, but with additional complication

When Ayeka realizes Katsuhito IS Yosho:
- Canon: He's aged, widowed, alone
- Our version: He's aged, partnered, built a life with Sheldon

## 2.3 — The Additional Layer

**Canon Betrayal:**
- "You never came back. You broke your promise."

**Our Version's Betrayal:**
- "You never came back. You broke your promise. And you chose... *him*?"

This isn't jealousy of Sheldon specifically. It's the realization that:
1. Yosho could have come back
2. Yosho chose not to
3. Yosho built a life — a PARTNERSHIP — with someone else
4. The engagement meant nothing to him
5. Her 700 years of waiting meant nothing to him

---

# PART 3: THE ROMANTIC COLLAPSE

## 3.1 — What Collapses

**In Canon:**
- Ayeka's hope to marry Yosho
- Her image of Yosho as "waiting for her"
- Redirects to Tenchi (Yosho's descendant, similar qualities)

**In Our Version:**
- Ayeka's hope to marry Yosho (same)
- Her image of Yosho as lonely/waiting (WORSE — he wasn't waiting at all)
- Her framework for romantic competition (NO replacement target)

## 3.2 — Why She Can't Just Redirect to Tenchi

**Canon allows this because:**
- Yosho is "unavailable" (aged, widowed)
- Tenchi resembles young Yosho
- Tenchi is impressive (activates sword, fights Kagato)
- No competing romantic partner for Yosho exists

**Our version complicates this because:**
- Tenchi has been raised by Sheldon (Yosho's partner)
- The household already has a romantic relationship established
- Pursuing Tenchi would put her in competition with... the family structure itself
- She's not competing with Ryoko for a bachelor — she's trying to insert herself into an established family

## 3.3 — The Emotional Stages

**Stage 1: Denial**
- "Katsuhito can't be Yosho"
- "That man (Sheldon) is just a servant/helper"
- "There must be an explanation"

**Stage 2: Anger**
- "You promised me!"
- "You let me wait 700 years!"
- "You chose a human — again! And a man!"
- Possible prejudice/shock about same-sex relationship (Jurai may or may not have this)

**Stage 3: Grief**
- Mourning the future she planned
- Mourning the image of Yosho she held
- Realizing she loved an idea, not the real person

**Stage 4: Acceptance**
- He's not the man she thought he was
- Her engagement was political convenience (for him)
- She has to build a new identity

**Stage 5: Reframing**
- She's still a princess
- She's still powerful
- She can still be valuable — but not as "Yosho's wife"
- The household offers something else: family

---

# PART 4: THE "AUNT" PIVOT

## 4.1 — Why "Aunt" Becomes Possible

**What Ayeka Needs:**
- Purpose
- Status
- Connection
- Identity beyond "failed fiancée"

**What the Household Offers:**
- Tenchi needs guidance (she's older, wiser in some ways)
- Sasami needs her sister
- The household lacks formal etiquette
- Her skills are valuable (diplomacy, manners, Jurai knowledge)

**The Reframe:**
Instead of: "Future Empress/Yosho's wife"
Becomes: "Royal aunt who brings dignity and wisdom"

## 4.2 — Sheldon's Role in This Transition

Sheldon doesn't compete with Ayeka. He:
- Already has his position
- Isn't threatened by her
- Treats her with respect
- Offers her a place without conditions

**Key Moment Possibility:**
Sheldon offers Ayeka food. Same as Ryoko. Same warmth.

He doesn't ask:
- "Why are you here?"
- "What do you want from Yosho?"
- "Are you going to cause trouble?"

He offers hospitality. That's it.

This confuses Ayeka (like it confused Ryoko). She expected:
- Competition
- Hostility
- Defensiveness

She gets: welcome.

## 4.3 — Relationship with Yosho Post-Revelation

**Canon:** Ayeka accepts Yosho as "grandfather figure" eventually
**Our Version:** Must also accept Yosho as "partnered"

This is harder because:
- She can see he's HAPPY
- He chose this life deliberately
- His partner is RIGHT THERE
- She has to watch what she could never have

**But also potentially easier because:**
- Clear closure (he's definitively "taken")
- No ambiguity (not "widowed and maybe available")
- She can move on completely

## 5.2 — Key Dialogue Moments

**Ayeka to Yosho (Confrontation):**
> "Seven hundred years. I waited seven hundred years for you."
> 
> *Yosho is silent.*
> 
> "You could have sent word. You could have released me from the engagement. You could have done *anything* other than let me drift through space believing you might be dead."
>
> *Beat.*
>
> "And you chose... him?"

**Yosho's Response (Options):**
- **Deflection:** "The circumstances were complicated."
- **Honesty:** "I never intended to return, Ayeka. I'm sorry."
- **Acknowledgment:** "I found happiness here. I should have told you."

**Ayeka's Grief (Private):**
> "I dyed my hair for him. I waited lifetimes for him. I built my entire existence around being worthy of him. And he was here. Happy. Without me. For seven hundred years."

**Sheldon to Ayeka (Hospitality):**
> "You must be tired. There's food, if you're hungry. And we can prepare a room."
>
> *No demands. No questions. Just welcome.*

## 5.3 — POV Decisions

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Space Battle/Arrival:** Tenchi POV (maintains his perspective as entry point)
2. **First Days:** Ayeka POV (her confusion, observations)
3. **Revelation Scenes:** Ayeka POV (her emotional journey is the core)
4. **Sheldon Hospitality:** Dual or Sheldon POV (shows his consistency)
5. **"Aunt" Emergence:** Ayeka POV (her reframe)

# PART 6: CASCADE FROM AYEKA'S ARRIVAL

## 6.1 — Immediate Effects

**On Ayeka:**
- Romantic framework collapses
- Must rebuild identity
- Has nowhere else to go (ship damaged, politically complicated to return)

**On Yosho:**
- Past catches up with him
- Must face what he did to Ayeka
- Partnership with Sheldon becomes "public" to family

**On Sheldon:**
- Now aware of Yosho's full history
- May need to process that Yosho was engaged
- His role as "partner" is validated/visible

**On Tenchi:**
- Learns grandfather's true identity (if not known already)
- Sees how complicated adult relationships are
- Two alien princesses now in household

**On Ryoko:**
- Rival arrival (expected competition)
- But Ayeka's framework collapse changes dynamic
- Less "competition" than expected

## 6.2 — Medium-Term Effects

**Household Structure:**
- Ayeka integrates as "aunt" not "rival"
- Brings Jurai etiquette/formality
- Sasami has her sister
- Political complications begin (Jurai will learn eventually)

**Ayeka-Ryoko Dynamic:**
- Canon: Constant romantic rivalry
- Our version: Rivalry diminished (no clear prize to compete for)
- May develop different relationship (still antagonistic personalities, but not romantic competition)

**Ayeka-Sheldon Dynamic:**
- Initial awkwardness (he's her fiancé's partner)
- Gradual respect (he cares for household well)
- Eventually: acceptance, possibly friendship

# PART 7: OUTSTANDING DECISIONS

## 7.1 — Timing Questions

| Question | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| When does Ayeka learn Katsuhito = Yosho? | Early / During Kagato / Later | **During Kagato arc** (same as canon — maximum dramatic impact) |
| When does she learn about the partnership? | Same time / Shortly after / Gradually | **Shortly after** (separate revelations, separate processing) |
| Does she confront Yosho immediately? | Yes / After processing | **After brief processing** (2-3 scenes of private grief first) |

## 7.2 — Character Questions

| Question | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Does Jurai have same-sex relationship taboos? | Yes / No / Complicated | **No strong taboo** (they're already okay with incest; same-sex less shocking) but may be **unusual** for royalty |
| How much did Sheldon know about Ayeka? | Nothing / Vague / Everything | **Vague** (Yosho mentioned engagement but not details) — Sheldon learns full story same time as audience |
| Does Ayeka's prejudice extend to Sheldon personally? | Yes / Only initially / No | **Only initially** — she's upset at the SITUATION, not Sheldon as person |

## 7.3 — Scene Questions

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Exact dialogue for Ayeka-Yosho confrontation | Framework provided; needs final draft |
| Sheldon's role during confrontation | Present? Absent? Called in? — TBD |
| Sasami's reaction to revelations | Needs development (she has Tsunami; may perceive more) |
