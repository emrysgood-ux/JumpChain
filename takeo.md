## LIFE HISTORY

### Early Life (1925-1940)
- Born to Tsukino Hana and her husband (died 1935)
- Raised by his mother after father's death
- Knew from childhood he would farm the family land
- Attended village school through 8th grade
- Began full-time farming at 15

### First Marriage & Tragedy (1939-1940)
- Married in 1939 (arranged; bride from neighboring village)
- Wife's name lost to time; died in childbirth with daughter Yuki (1940)
- Left at 15 with a newborn and a farm to run
- Mother Hana stepped in to raise Yuki while Takeo worked

### The War Years (1941-1945)
- Not conscripted due to "essential agricultural work" status
- Farm struggled with labor shortages and requisitions
- Kept the family fed when many went hungry
- Felt guilt about not serving; never spoke of it

### Postwar Period (1945-1958)
- Rebuilt the farm in the difficult postwar years
- Raised Yuki with Hana's help
- Remarried in 1948 (brief; wife left after two years, unable to handle rural life)
- From second marriage: son Kiyoshi born 1935 [Note: This contradicts — see resolution below]

**⚠️ TIMELINE CLARIFICATION:**
The original backstory had Kiyoshi as Takeo's brother. Per the corrected canon:
- Kiyoshi (born 1935) is Takeo's son from his SECOND marriage
- Second wife stayed long enough to bear Kiyoshi, then left (1936)
- This makes Kiyoshi Yuki's half-brother (same father, different mothers)
- Yuki's mother died in childbirth (1940)
- Kiyoshi's mother left when he was an infant (1936)
- Both children raised by Takeo and grandmother Hana

### Yuki's Departure (1958)
- Daughter Yuki (age 18) met American serviceman James Carter
- Takeo disapproved but could not stop her
- She left for America pregnant with Sheldon
- Takeo never forgave himself for not trying harder to keep her
- They exchanged letters but never saw each other again

### Final Years (1958-1978)
- Continued farming alone after Kiyoshi moved to Osaka (1955)
- Health declined gradually; refused to see doctors
- Mother Hana helped until her own age limited her
- Found dead in the fields, October 8, 1978 — heart gave out mid-harvest
- Neighbors said he died the way he would have wanted: working

## RELATIONSHIPS

### With Hana (Mother)
- Deep bond; she was his anchor after his wife died
- They lived together his whole life
- He cared for her as she aged; she survived him by one year
- Buried side by side in family plot

### With Yuki (Daughter)
- Loved her fiercely but couldn't express it
- Traditional father: expected obedience, got defiance
- Her leaving broke something in him
- Kept every letter she sent; couldn't bring himself to reply often
- Died believing she'd forgotten the village

### With Kiyoshi (Son)
- Closer in temperament; both quiet, practical
- Taught him the farm work, expected him to take over
- Understood when Kiyoshi left for factory work (the farm couldn't support two families)
- They understood each other without many words

### With Sheldon (Grandson — Never Met)
- Knew of Sheldon only through Yuki's letters and one photograph
- An American grandson seemed impossibly distant
- Wondered what his own blood looked like with foreign features
- Died before they could ever meet

## WHAT VILLAGERS REMEMBER

> "Takeo-san was a good man. Quiet. Worked hard. Died too young."

> "His daughter went to America — we heard she had a child there. Scandal at the time, but what could he do?"

> "After Yuki left, he was never quite the same. Still worked, still nodded hello. But something went out of him."

> "Died in the field with a hoe in his hand. That's how he would have wanted it."

> "His mother Hana just... faded after that. Year later she was gone too."

## THE FAMILY PROPERTY

Takeo left behind:
- **The house:** Traditional farmhouse, empty since 1978
- **The land:** Small plot, overgrown now
- **The graves:** Family cemetery plot with Hana, Takeo, and ancestors

Kiyoshi inherited everything but couldn't maintain it from Osaka. He pays taxes, arranges minimal upkeep, and carries guilt about the abandoned property.

---

## NARRATIVE FUNCTION

Takeo is the absent grandfather — the weight of expectation, the guilt of separation, the silence of men who couldn't speak their love. Sheldon will visit his grave and feel... complicated things. A man he never knew, whose blood runs in his veins, whose disappointment in Yuki's choices echoes through time.

**Thematic resonance:** Takeo and Dorothy Mae never met, but they're mirrors — elders who shaped their grandchildren through presence (Dorothy Mae) and absence (Takeo). Both loved fiercely. Both lost too much. Both are now only memories.

---

## COSMOS'S CREATION NOTE

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Takeo genuinely existed in the rewritten reality. He was not invented as a cover story. Cosmos rewrote causality so that Takeo's life, grief, work, and death are all REAL. His bones lie in the village cemetery. Villagers remember him. The property records bear his name.

Sheldon carries his blood — because Cosmos made it so.
