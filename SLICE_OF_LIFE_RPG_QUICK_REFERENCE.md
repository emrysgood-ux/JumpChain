## 1. SCENE GENERATION CHECKLIST

Before writing any scene, answer:

1. **What Connection is this scene about?** (Which relationship?)
2. **What Quest does this advance?** (Which character journey?)
3. **What XP Action type is this?**
   - **Shared Action**: Doing simple, honest things together
   - **Shared Reaction**: Talking about important things
   - **Slice of Life**: Emotional reaction to the world; mood piece
4. **What small problem or need drives it?** (See Problem Types below)
5. **Does this earn a Meaningful Moment?** (Investment that strengthens relationships)
6. **Should the POV character 'fade' after this?** (Let others shine)

## 7. ISSUES (Complications)

Emotional/physical complications that develop during play:

**Potential Sheldon Issues:**
- Homesickness (for previous life/world)
- Impostor Syndrome (feeling unqualified)
- Culture Shock (Japanese customs)
- Scientific Dissonance (supernatural vs. physics)

**Issue Sequence Example (Homesickness):**
1. Something reminds you of your old life
2. You experience a pang of loss
3. You try to recreate something from before
4. The recreation fails or succeeds unexpectedly
5. You find something new that partially fills the gap

---

## 8. THE FADE MECHANIC

After a character has a significant emotional moment:
- **Shift focus** to another character's perspective
- **Wait 2-3 scenes** before returning to that character
- **Purpose**: Prevents melodrama accumulation; gives moments space to breathe

**Frequency guideline:**
- Major POV character: 2-3 XP Actions per day
- Secondary POV: 1-2 XP Actions per day

---

## 9. THE GOLDEN RULE

**From Golden Sky Stories:**
> "The stakes are deliberately low. These problems would eventually resolve on their own. But the characters can step in and heal the hurt feelings or the miscommunications more quickly."

**From Chuubo's:**
> "This is the kind of game where wishes come true. It's a progressive, warm-hearted game that focuses on adventure and slice-of-life stories."

**For Son of Cosmos:**
> The goal is not to create drama through conflict but to create warmth through connection. Every scene should leave the reader feeling that these characters matter to each other, and that small kindnesses accumulate into something meaningful.
