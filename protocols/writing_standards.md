# WRITING STANDARDS FOR AWARD-WORTHY FICTION
## Dashboard — Task-Oriented Craft Reference
## Bible v14.3 | Codex v5.2

---

## PURPOSE

This dashboard provides craft standards for every scene. Use it during:
- Pre-scene planning (what tier am I targeting?)
- Mid-scene writing (am I earning this emotion?)
- Post-scene audit (does this pass the checklists?)

---

## QUALITY TIER DEFINITIONS

### Scene Quality Tiers

| Tier | Name | Criteria | Action |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Reject | Breaks Laws, violates POV, contradicts canon | Delete/rewrite |
| 2 | Functional | Meets minimum standards, serves plot | Revise for craft |
| 3 | Competent | Solid craft, voice present, serves story | **MINIMUM TARGET** |
| 4 | Excellent | Memorable prose, emotional resonance | Target for significant scenes |
| 5 | Exceptional | Award-worthy, reader remembers years later | Rare—don't force |

### Prose Quality Tiers

| Tier | Name | Reader Experience |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | Weak | Unclear, redundant, generic → skims |
| 2 | Serviceable | Clear but unremarkable → forgettable |
| 3 | Solid | Clean, varied, purposeful → pleasant, voice present |
| 4 | Strong | Distinctive, rhythmic, precise → quotable |
| 5 | Masterful | Every word essential → reader stops to admire |

### Character Moment Tiers

| Tier | Name | Reader Response |
|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Puppet | "Why did they do that?" |
| 2 | Sketch | Functional but forgettable |
| 3 | Believable | Engagement without full immersion |
| 4 | Alive | Reader forgets character is fictional |
| 5 | Unforgettable | Changes how reader sees the world |

## EMOTIONAL RESONANCE STANDARDS

### Setup/Payoff Ratio Table

| Emotional Size | Required Setup | Example |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Minor** (smile, frustration) | Same scene | A joke lands |
| **Moderate** (tears, anger, relief) | Same chapter/day | Argument resolution |
| **Major** (catharsis, transformation) | Multiple chapters/weeks | Character breakthrough |
| **Epic** (life-defining moment) | Multiple story-years | Katsuhito reveals his identity |

### Earning Emotion Checklist

Before writing an emotional beat, verify:

1. **Setup Ratio**: Is emotional size justified by setup amount?
2. **Showing**: Is emotion demonstrated through action/detail, not told?
3. **Character Truth**: Does this beat reveal character?
4. **Reader Parallel**: Can reader feel independently, not by instruction?
5. **Aftermath**: Is there space for emotion to land?

### Sentimentality vs. Earned Emotion

| Sentimentality (AVOID) | Earned Emotion (TARGET) |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Emotion asserted | Emotion demonstrated |
| Generic triggers | Specific, character-grounded moments |
| Manipulative shortcuts | Investment through accumulated detail |
| Reader told how to feel | Reader discovers feeling independently |

---

## PROSE CRAFT STANDARDS

### Sentence-Level Excellence

Every sentence should demonstrate:
- **Clarity**: Meaning immediately apparent
- **Necessity**: Every word earns its place
- **Precision**: Exact right word, not approximate
- **Rhythm**: Varied from neighboring sentences
- **Voice**: Sounds like POV character's mind

### Son of Cosmos Prose Position

| Context | Style Target |
|---------|--------------|
| Baseline narration | Clean/Accessible — clear, engaging, unobtrusive |
| Emotional peaks | Literary/Upmarket — prose rises to match moment |
| Action sequences | Tighter, shorter sentences |
| Reflection | Longer, more complex sentences |

### Paragraph Craft

- **Unity**: One main idea per paragraph
- **Coherence**: Logical flow between sentences
- **Emphasis**: Important information at beginning or end
- **Variation**: Mix short and long paragraphs

---

## SCENE CRAFT STANDARDS

### Scene Requirements (Law 80 + Craft)

Every scene must:
1. Pass Law 80 necessity test
2. Open with a hook (first paragraph earns second)
3. Show change (something different at end)
4. Maintain consistent POV voice
5. Include sensory texture (minimum 3 details)
6. Serve emotional purpose
7. Plant or harvest a seed
8. Achieve minimum Tier 3 quality

### Scene Opening Types

| Type | Use When |
|------|----------|
| Action | Scene needs immediate momentum |
| Dialogue | Character voice establishes tone |
| Setting | Location is crucial to scene meaning |
| Interiority | Internal state drives scene |
| Contrast | Juxtaposition creates meaning |

## AUDIT CHECKLISTS

### Sentence-Level Audit (7 Checks)

Use on major scenes or when prose feels weak:

- [ ] **Clarity**: Is meaning immediately clear?
- [ ] **Necessity**: Does every word earn its place?
- [ ] **Precision**: Is this the EXACT right word?
- [ ] **Rhythm**: Does sentence length vary from neighbors?
- [ ] **Voice**: Does this sound like POV character's mind?
- [ ] **Sensory**: If describing, are specific senses engaged?
- [ ] **Filter Words**: Are unnecessary filters removed? (Law 28)

### Scene-Level Audit (8 Checks)

Use on every scene before finalization:

- [ ] **Necessity**: Does scene pass Law 80 test?
- [ ] **Opening**: Does first paragraph hook?
- [ ] **Change**: What's different at end vs. beginning?
- [ ] **Voice**: Is POV character's voice consistent throughout?
- [ ] **Texture**: Are there at least 3 sensory details?
- [ ] **Emotion**: What should reader feel? Is it earned?
- [ ] **Foreshadow**: What seed planted or harvested?
- [ ] **Tier**: What quality tier does scene achieve?

### Chapter-Level Audit (6 Checks)

Use when completing a chapter:

- [ ] **Arc**: What micro-arc completes this chapter?
- [ ] **Balance**: Is there variety (tone, pacing, scene type)?
- [ ] **Momentum**: Does chapter ending pull forward?
- [ ] **Character**: Which characters advanced/revealed?
- [ ] **Theme**: How does chapter embody story themes?

## QUICK REFERENCE

### Before Writing a Scene

1. What tier am I targeting? (Usually 3, sometimes 4)
2. What should reader feel at end?
3. Is the setup sufficient for that emotion?
4. What seed will I plant or harvest?

### During Writing

1. Am I maintaining POV voice?
2. Am I earning emotion through specific detail?
3. Is prose at appropriate level for scene type?

### After Writing

1. Run scene-level audit (8 checks)
2. For major scenes, run sentence-level audit (7 checks)
3. Assign quality tier
4. If below Tier 3, revise before proceeding

---

## SON OF COSMOS CORE THEMES

When checking thematic integration, reference:

1. **Found Family** — Bonds of choice over blood
2. **Identity** — Who we are vs. who we were made to be
3. **Purpose** — Finding meaning through connection
4. **Growth** — Transformation through relationship
5. **Home** — Place as emotional anchor
6. **Legacy** — What we inherit, what we pass on

Every scene should touch at least one theme, even lightly.
