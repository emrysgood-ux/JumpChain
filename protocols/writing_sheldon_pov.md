## FORBIDDEN WORDS (Law 65)

**NEVER use these in Sheldon POV during Phase I:**

| Word | Why Forbidden |
|------|---------------|
| Cosmos | His mother's name — he doesn't know |
| Sailor Cosmos | Same |
| Lambda | Power source — he doesn't know |
| Jurai / Juraian | Alien race — he doesn't know |
| Galaxy Police | Organization — he doesn't know |
| Ryoko | Sealed demon — he doesn't know |
| Washu | Goddess — he doesn't know |
| Tsunami | Goddess — he doesn't know |
| Phase I/II/III | Meta terms |
| "remade" / "created" | Cosmic context |
| "reborn" | Cosmic context |

**Replacements:**
- "Cosmos" → "whatever force brought me here"
- "Powers" → "these changes he couldn't explain"
- "Abilities" → "things his body could do that surprised him"

- Rarely speaks his thoughts aloud
- When emotional, goes quiet

### Characteristic Thoughts:
- "Facts. Start with facts."

## SENSORY WRITING GUIDE

## EMOTIONAL BEATS

### Suppressed Emotions:
