## Description

Manages the evolution and consistency of symbols, metaphors, and motifs across the narrative. Ensures that symbolic elements are introduced with purpose, developed meaningfully, and resolved appropriately—never abandoned or contradicted.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Track introduction and resolution of all recurring images
- Ensure metaphors evolve alongside character and theme development
- Map motifs to scene transitions and arc boundaries
- Prevent "dead symbols" (introduced but never used)
- Maintain symbolic consistency across timeline

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Create layered meaning through symbol interaction
- Support theme reinforcement through imagery
- Build emotional resonance through pattern recognition
- Reward attentive readers with symbolic payoffs

## PART II: SYMBOL DEFINITIONS

### 2.1 Symbol Categories

| Category | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Object Symbol** | Physical item with recurring significance | Tenchi-ken, wallet photograph |
| **Natural Symbol** | Environmental element carrying meaning | Funaho tree, shrine steps |
| **Action Symbol** | Repeated behavior with significance | Cooking, climbing steps |
| **Sensory Symbol** | Recurring sensory detail | Cedar scent, warmth in chest |
| **Verbal Symbol** | Repeated phrase or word | "The shrine has room" |
| **Structural Symbol** | Story element as symbol | The cave as sealed past |

### 2.2 Symbol Lifecycle Stages

```
INTRODUCTION → ESTABLISHMENT → DEVELOPMENT → TRANSFORMATION → RESOLUTION
     ↓              ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓
  First use    Repeated use    Meaning deepens   Meaning shifts   Payoff/closure

## PART IV: LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT

### 4.1 Introduction Protocol

When introducing a symbol:
1. First appearance should be notable but not heavy-handed
2. Provide sensory grounding (sight, sound, smell, touch)
3. Attach to character's emotional state
4. Document in registry immediately

**Red Flags:**
- Symbol introduced in throwaway line (too weak)
- Symbol introduced with explicit "this means X" (too obvious)
- Symbol contradicts established imagery

### 4.2 Establishment Protocol

For establishing recurring presence:
- Minimum 3 uses before symbol "counts"
- Each use should add slight variation
- Space uses appropriately (not clustering)
- Connect to different contexts to build layers

**Example (Cedar Scent):**
1. Day 1: "Cedar smell as he entered the shrine"
2. Day 3: "The familiar cedar, already becoming normal"
3. Day 14: "Cedar on Katsuhito's hands after shrine maintenance"

### 4.3 Development Protocol

For deepening symbol meaning:
- Add emotional associations beyond initial
- Connect symbol to character growth
- Allow character to notice symbol consciously
- Build reader expectations for payoff

**Example (Warmth in Chest):**
- Initially: Physical sensation, unexplained
- Month 3: Associated with moments of belonging
- Month 6: Noticed to appear when feeling loved
- Year 1: Understood as presence, not just sensation

### 4.4 Transformation Protocol

For shifting symbol meaning:
- Signal shift through context change
- Allow character to recognize change
- Don't abandon original meaning—layer new meaning
- Transformation should feel earned, not arbitrary

**Example (Shrine Steps):**
- Original: Physical challenge (struggle)
- Transformed: Daily meditation (purpose)
- Further: Home's threshold (belonging)

### 4.5 Resolution Protocol

For symbolic payoff:
- Explicit or implicit connection to journey
- Emotional resonance with reader expectation
- Does not require "explaining" the symbol
- May transform rather than end (ongoing stories)

## PART V: SYMBOL INTERACTION

### 5.1 Reinforcing Combinations

Symbols that strengthen each other:

| Primary | Secondary | Combined Effect |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Warmth | Cooking | Love given and received |
| Steps | Morning light | Hope through effort |
| Cave | Funaho Tree | Sealed secrets, patient watchers |
| Cedar | Steps | Journey home |

### 5.2 Contrasting Combinations

Symbols that create tension:

| Symbol A | Symbol B | Tension Created |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Warmth | Cave | Safety vs. sealed danger |
| Cooking | Wallet photo | New life vs. mystery past |
| Steps (ascending) | Cave (descending) | Growth vs. buried secrets |

### 5.3 Forbidden Combinations

Symbols that should not appear together:
- Cave + Warmth directly (undermines both)
- Lambda cooking + failure without purpose (contradicts core)
