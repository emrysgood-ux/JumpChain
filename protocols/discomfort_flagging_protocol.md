## Description

Identifies emotionally difficult scenes for the writer that may need review, revision, or scheduled breaks. Tracks writer hesitation signals and ensures emotional quality remains high even in challenging content.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Track writer hesitation and internal conflict signals
- Tag scenes for emotional load assessment
- Schedule re-evaluation after appropriate cooldown periods
- Prevent burnout on emotionally demanding content
- Ensure difficult scenes receive proper attention rather than avoidance

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Document why scenes are difficult (craft vs. content)
- Create safe re-entry points for abandoned drafts
- Maintain scene quality regardless of emotional cost
- Balance narrative necessity with writer wellbeing

## PART III: FLAGGING TRIGGERS

### 3.1 Automatic Flags
The following content automatically triggers a discomfort flag:

**Sheldon's Past:**
- Parental death memories (CD-1, CD-2)
- Grandmother's decline and death (CD-1)
- Closeted sexuality isolation (CD-4)
- Alaska accident details (CD-1, CD-2)
- Maria Chen's scream (CD-2)

**Story Events:**

- Rea's abandoned childhood (CD-1, CD-2)
- Yosho's 700-year isolation (CD-6)
- Canon character trauma (varies)

### 3.2 Manual Flag Indicators
Flag a scene if:
- [ ] Writer delays starting despite available time
- [ ] Multiple incomplete drafts accumulating
- [ ] Physical tension during writing (clenched jaw, hunched shoulders)
- [ ] Avoidance behaviors (sudden need to research unrelated topics)
- [ ] Emotional spillover after writing session ends
- [ ] Scene feels "wrong" without clear technical reason

## PART V: MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### 5.1 Before Writing

**Preparation Techniques:**
1. Read voice guides for all characters in scene
2. Review scene's narrative necessity
3. Set timer for focused work (25-45 minutes)
4. Identify exit points for incomplete drafts
5. Prepare comfort activity for after session

### 5.2 During Writing

**If Difficulty Increases:**
1. Note current position in document
2. Write bracketed placeholder: `[FLAG: returning to this]`
3. Skip to next manageable section
4. Log what was avoided and why

**Grounding Techniques:**
- Physical movement between difficult passages
- Reading completed sections for momentum
- Switching to action beats when emotion overwhelms

### 5.3 After Writing

**Cooldown Protocol:**
1. Save and close document
2. Engage in unrelated activity (minimum 30 minutes)
3. Log session in [[creative_intent_archive.md]]
4. Schedule review for noted cooldown period
5. Assess emotional state before next session

## PART VI: QUALITY ASSURANCE

### 6.1 Review Checklist

**After Cooldown:**
- [ ] Emotional load serves narrative (not gratuitous)
- [ ] Character reactions proportional to events
- [ ] Reader given processing space (pacing)
- [ ] Hope/relief moments present near difficult content
- [ ] Craft quality maintained (not rushed to finish)

**Comparison Questions:**
- Does this scene read like I was present or fleeing?
- Is the difficulty in the content or my execution?
- Would a reader find this earned or exploitative?
- Have I provided emotional throughline (beginning → peak → release)?

### 6.2 Revision Signals

**Consider revision if:**
- Scene reads significantly different after cooldown
- Multiple beta readers note same issue
- Scene feels exploitative rather than meaningful
- Character voice became inconsistent under pressure
- Pacing collapsed (either too fast or too slow)

---

## PART VII: INTEGRATION

### 7.1 Related Systems
- **Creative Intent Archive:** Log reasons scenes matter
- **Scene Registry:** Track flagged scenes in master list
- **Session Startup Dashboard:** Review flags before each session

### 7.2 Session Protocol

**Start of Session:**
1. Check for scenes approaching cooldown expiration
2. Review any incomplete flagged drafts
3. Decide: tackle flagged content or work around it

**End of Session:**
1. Update flag status for worked scenes
2. Add new flags as needed
3. Log emotional state briefly

---

## PART VIII: EXEMPTIONS

### 8.1 When to Push Through
- Deadline requirements (with documented necessity)
- Scene is blocking critical story progress
- Difficulty is primarily technical, not emotional
- Writer explicitly chooses to challenge comfort zone

### 8.2 When to Absolutely Stop
- Physical symptoms (headache, nausea, trembling)
- Emotional flooding that doesn't subside
- Intrusive thoughts continuing post-session
- Scenes are triggering personal trauma (not just difficult)
