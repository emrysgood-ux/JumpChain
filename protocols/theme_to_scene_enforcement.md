## Description

Ensures every scene reinforces core story themes directly or subtextually. Prevents thematic drift and maintains narrative coherence across a multi-million-word epic spanning 1,000 years.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Tag all scenes with dominant and subtext themes
- Detect and flag thematic drift before it compounds
- Use semantic matching to identify off-theme content
- Ensure every scene serves the story's core meaning
- Balance theme reinforcement with natural storytelling

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Track theme evolution across timeline
- Map theme density to prevent overstatement
- Identify thematic gaps requiring attention
- Connect themes to character arcs

## PART III: SCENE THEME TAGGING

### 3.1 Tagging Format

Each scene receives:
- **Dominant Theme:** Primary theme expressed (1 required)
- **Subtext Themes:** Secondary themes present (0-3)
- **Theme Intensity:** How strongly theme is expressed (1-5)
- **Expression Method:** How theme manifests (dialogue/action/imagery/contrast)

### 3.2 Tagging Template

```markdown
## Scene Theme Tag: [Scene ID]

**Dominant Theme:** [Theme Name]
**Intensity:** [1-5]
**Expression Method:** [dialogue/action/imagery/contrast]

**Subtext Themes:**
1. [Theme] — [brief explanation]
2. [Theme] — [brief explanation]

**Theme Verification:**
- [ ] Dominant theme clearly present
- [ ] No contradictory themes introduced
- [ ] Intensity appropriate for scene type
```

### 3.3 Example Tags (Son of Cosmos)

**Day 1, Scene 7: Katsuhito Meeting**
- **Dominant:** Hidden Depths (Yosho's true nature)
- **Intensity:** 3 (subtle, not overt)
- **Method:** Action (impossible grace), Imagery (ancient eyes)
- **Subtext:** Second Chances (offering Sheldon place), Trust Building (testing character)

**Day 8: First Cooking Scene**
- **Dominant:** Love as Action
- **Intensity:** 4 (explicit expression)
- **Method:** Action (preparing food), Dialogue (reactions)
- **Subtext:** Healing Through Connection, Domestic Sacred

---

## PART IV: THEMATIC DRIFT DETECTION

### 4.1 Warning Signs

**Red Flags:**
- 3+ consecutive scenes without dominant theme
- Scene contradicts established theme expression
- Character behaves against their thematic role
- Subtext overwhelms dominant theme
- Theme stated explicitly rather than shown

### 4.2 Drift Categories

| Type | Description | Correction |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Thematic Void** | Scene serves no theme | Add thematic element or cut scene |
| **Theme Contradiction** | Scene undermines established theme | Revise or justify contradiction |
| **Theme Crowding** | Too many themes competing | Simplify, move themes to other scenes |
| **Theme Overstatement** | Theme too explicit/preachy | Submerge into action/imagery |
| **Theme Mismatch** | Wrong phase emphasis | Realign with phase priorities |

### 4.3 Drift Tolerance

| Level | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Single scene void | Note, monitor |
| 2 consecutive voids | Address before continuing |
| Theme contradiction | Immediate revision required |
| Pattern emerging | Full arc review |

---

## PART V: THEME DENSITY MAPPING

### 5.1 Optimal Distribution

| Theme Intensity | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| Level 5 (Explicit) | 1 per arc | Climax moments |
| Level 4 (Strong) | 2-3 per chapter | Key scenes |
| Level 3 (Clear) | Most scenes | Standard expression |
| Level 2 (Subtle) | Support scenes | Background texture |
| Level 1 (Implied) | Rare | Reader interpretation |

### 5.2 Avoiding Oversaturation

**Per Chapter:**
- No more than 2 Level 4+ scenes for same theme
- Rotate dominant themes every 3-4 scenes
- Allow "rest" scenes (Level 2) between intense moments

**Per Arc:**
- Each primary theme should dominate at least 20% of scenes
- No theme should dominate more than 40% of scenes
- Secondary themes fill remaining thematic space

### 5.3 Theme Calendar

Track monthly/quarterly theme emphasis:

| Period | Dominant | Secondary | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Days 1-7 | Second Chances | Hidden Depths | Establishment |
| Days 8-28 | Found Family | Love as Action | Integration |
| Month 2 | Healing | Trust Building | Deepening |
| Month 3-6 | Domestic Sacred | Patience | Routine |

## PART VI: THEMATIC SCENE CONSTRUCTION

### 6.1 Theme Integration Methods

**Method 1: Action Embodiment**
Character performs action that demonstrates theme
> *Sheldon stayed up reheating soup three times until Katsuhito finally came home.* (Love as Action)

**Method 2: Dialogue Resonance**
Character speaks truth that echoes theme
> *"The shrine has room for those who work."* (Second Chances)

**Method 3: Image/Symbol**
Visual element carries thematic weight
> *The 320 steps. He counted them this time.* (Patience, Journey)

**Method 4: Contrast**
Scene demonstrates theme through its absence/opposite
> *The silence of the empty apartment. Three years alone.* (Found Family — by showing its lack)

**Method 5: Character Reaction**
Response reveals thematic understanding
> *Tenchi's trust, so freely given. Sheldon didn't deserve it. Not yet.* (Trust Building)

### 6.2 Theme Reinforcement Without Preaching

**DO:**
- Show theme through character choice
- Let reader infer meaning from action
- Use imagery and symbol
- Allow contradiction and complexity
- Trust reader intelligence

**DON'T:**
- State theme explicitly in narration
- Have characters discuss theme directly
- Resolve thematic tension too quickly
- Make theme binary (good/bad)
- Repeat same thematic beat identically
