## Description

Models and tracks truth disruptions in narratives with unreliable elements, hidden information, and dramatic irony. Ensures that revelations are properly paced, information asymmetry creates meaningful tension, and "truth" collapses at narratively optimal moments rather than prematurely.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Map the lifecycle of truths: introduction, challenge, collapse
- Prevent premature tension resolution through early reveals
- Maintain productive information asymmetry between characters and readers
- Ensure contradictions and mysteries are intentional, not accidental
- Control the pacing of revelation sequences

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Create layered truth states (what characters know vs. believe vs. readers know)
- Build toward satisfying "truth collapse" moments
- Maintain narrative ambiguity where appropriate
- Track unreliable elements without losing control

---

## PART II: TRUTH STATE FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Truth Categories

| Category | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Hidden Truth** | Information withheld from characters | Yosho's identity as Katsuhito |
| **Believed Falsehood** | What characters believe but is wrong | "Katsuhito is an old human" |
| **Reader Truth** | What readers know that characters don't | Dramatic irony elements |
| **Character Truth** | What specific characters know | Katsuhito knows his own identity |
| **Consensus Reality** | What the world collectively "knows" | "Normal Earth shrine" |

### 2.2 Truth Lifecycle

```
ESTABLISHMENT → QUESTIONING → TENSION → COLLAPSE → NEW EQUILIBRIUM
      ↓              ↓           ↓          ↓            ↓
   Truth set    Doubt enters  Stakes rise  Truth breaks  New truth forms
```

### 2.3 Asymmetry Matrix

For each truth, track:

| Knows | Sheldon | Katsuhito | Tenchi | Reader |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Yosho identity | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| Cave contents | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| Cosmos bond | Vague | No | No | Yes |
| Sheldon's past life | Yes | No | No | Yes |

## PART III: SON OF COSMOS TRUTH REGISTRY

### 3.1 Major Hidden Truths

#### TRUTH-001: Katsuhito is Yosho
| Stage | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Establishment | Day 1+ | Presented as elderly human priest |
| Questioning | Year 1+ | Impossible grace seeds planted |
| Tension | Years 5-12 | Accumulating observations |
| Collapse | Year 13 | Ryoko release forces revelation |
| New Equilibrium | Year 13+ | Sheldon knows, relationship transforms |

**Protection Rules:**
- No explicit confirmation before Year 13
- Seeds can be planted but not harvested early
- Near-misses permitted (increases tension)

#### TRUTH-002: The Cave Contains Ryoko
| Stage | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Establishment | Day 1 | Warned away, forbidden |
| Questioning | Years 1-12 | Why so forbidden? |
| Tension | Year 12-13 | Building unease |
| Collapse | Year 13 | Tenchi enters, Ryoko awakens |
| New Equilibrium | Year 13+ | Cave no longer forbidden |

**Protection Rules:**
- Cave name (Ryoko's cave) forbidden in narration
- Environmental tension, never explanation
- Katsuhito's warnings never explained

#### TRUTH-003: Sheldon's Cosmic Origin
| Stage | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Establishment | Day 1 | Woke in field, no memory of arrival |
| Questioning | Year 1 | Warmth in chest, cooking effects |
| Tension | Years 2-12 | Growing awareness of strangeness |
| Collapse | Year 1 Dream + | Cosmos reveals herself progressively |
| New Equilibrium | Year 13+ | Full understanding of Lambda powers |

**Protection Rules:**
- Sheldon cannot articulate what he doesn't know
- Cosmos contact is gradual, never info-dump
- Reader learns slightly ahead of Sheldon

#### TRUTH-004: Kiyone's "Death"
| Stage | Timeline | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Establishment | Pre-story | Family believes she died in accident |
| Reader Truth | — | Airi has her in suspended animation |
| Character Truth | Katsuhito may suspect | Never confirmed in Phase I |
| Collapse | Post-Year 13 | When Tenchi meets Tennyo |

**Protection Rules:**
- Grief is real; don't undermine with hints
- Family's pain is authentic
- Reveal must be earned emotionally

### 3.2 Secondary Hidden Truths

| Truth | Hidden From | Revealed When |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Rea's Geminar origin | Rea herself | Far future |
| Tenchi's Juraian heritage | Tenchi | Year 13 |
| Lambda powers in cooking | All except Cosmos | Gradual |
| Tsukino family creation | All | Never (Cosmos secret) |
| Funaho tree sentience | Sheldon | Year 13+ |

## PART IV: PREMATURE REVEAL PREVENTION

### 4.1 Reveal Triggers (What Would Collapse Truth)

For each major truth, identify what could accidentally reveal it:

**TRUTH-001 (Yosho):**
- Using Juraian terminology
- Describing Light Hawk Wings
- Mentioning 700-year timespan
- Katsuhito moving at superhuman speed explicitly
- Anyone calling him "Yosho" or "Prince"

**TRUTH-002 (Ryoko):**
- Naming the cave's occupant
- Describing the seal
- Mentioning space pirates
- Any hint of what's inside
- Katsuhito explaining the warning

**TRUTH-003 (Cosmos):**
- Full dream conversation before Year 1 end
- Explicit Lambda power naming
- Sheldon thinking "my cosmic mother"
- Warmth identified as communication too early

### 4.2 Near-Miss Techniques

Create tension by approaching revelation without triggering it:

**Technique 1: Observation Without Conclusion**
> *He watched Katsuhito's hands, the way they moved through the kata with a precision that seemed... impossible wasn't the right word. Excessive, maybe. Like a master pretending to be merely excellent.*

**Technique 2: Character Distraction**
> *The question formed—how does a man his age move like that?—but Tenchi came running, and the thought dissolved.*

**Technique 3: Misattribution**
> *Something about the cave made his skin prickle. Bad memories, probably. Old places held energy. That was all.*

### 4.3 Information Containment

**Per Scene:**
- Before writing, list what truths are at risk
- Identify what POV character actually knows
- Write from that knowledge state only
- Review for accidental leaks

**Per Chapter:**
- Truth state audit at chapter end
- Confirm no premature reveals
- Update knowledge state tracker

---

## PART V: BUILDING TOWARD COLLAPSE

### 5.1 Tension Escalation Patterns

**The Accumulation Model:**
Small details build toward breaking point
> Scene 1: Notices unusual strength
> Scene 5: Notices unusual knowledge
> Scene 12: Notices unusual reactions
> Scene 20: Observations coalesce into question
> Scene 30: Question demands answer

**The Pressure Cooker Model:**
External events force reveal
> Status quo maintained → Event occurs → Truth cannot stay hidden → Collapse

**The Earned Discovery Model:**
Character actively investigates
> Curiosity → Research → Near-miss → Setback → Breakthrough

### 5.2 Collapse Choreography

When truth finally collapses:
1. **The Trigger:** What specific event forces revelation
2. **The Moment:** How the truth breaks
3. **The Aftermath:** Immediate emotional response
4. **The Reprocessing:** Character re-evaluates past events
5. **The New Normal:** Relationship/world adjusts

### 5.3 Satisfying vs. Disappointing Reveals

**Satisfying:**
- Seeds were planted that now make sense
- Character has earned the knowledge
- Emotional payoff matches buildup
- Changes relationships meaningfully
- Opens new story possibilities

**Disappointing:**
- Came from nowhere (no seeds)
- Character stumbled into it accidentally
- Anticlimatic after long buildup
- Doesn't change anything significant
- Closes more doors than it opens

---

## PART VI: READER VS. CHARACTER KNOWLEDGE

### 6.1 Dramatic Irony Management

**Effective Use:**
- Reader anticipation of character discovery
- Tension from watching characters approach danger
- Emotional depth from understanding characters don't
- Satisfaction when character finally learns

**Overuse Warning Signs:**
- Reader frustration at character obliviousness
- Tension deflates because answer is known
- Scenes feel redundant (reader already knows)
- Character seems artificially stupid

### 6.2 Balancing Asymmetry

**Rules:**
- Reader should never know everything
- Character should never know nothing
- Some mysteries remain even for readers
- Gradual narrowing of gap creates momentum

### 6.3 Protecting Reader Mysteries

Even readers shouldn't know:
- Full nature of Cosmos (eternal mystery)
- Whether all seeds will be planted
- Some future plot developments
- Character decisions before they're made
