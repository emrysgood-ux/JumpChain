## Description

Tracks and enforces character and narrative voice consistency across all scenes, chapters, and arcs. Prevents voice drift, cross-contamination between characters, and ensures POV integrity throughout a multi-million-word narrative spanning 1,000 years.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Map syntax, tone, and idiomatic style for each POV character
- Auto-flag inconsistent phrasing and vocabulary
- Maintain narration alignment across timeline and phases
- Preserve character voice evolution while preventing drift
- Ensure internal monologue matches character identity

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Track voice changes as characters develop
- Distinguish between intentional evolution and accidental drift
- Maintain consistent narrative voice for the story
- Preserve era-appropriate language patterns

---

## PART II: VOICE COMPONENTS

### 2.1 Voice Elements

| Component | Definition | Example Variance |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **Syntax** | Sentence structure patterns | Complex vs. simple, long vs. short |
| **Diction** | Word choice and vocabulary | Academic vs. casual, formal vs. familiar |
| **Rhythm** | Pacing of thoughts and speech | Staccato vs. flowing, interrupted vs. complete |
| **Imagery** | Types of metaphors/comparisons | Scientific vs. natural, domestic vs. cosmic |
| **Register** | Formality level | Formal vs. casual vs. intimate |
| **Idiolect** | Personal speech quirks | Catchphrases, avoidance patterns, filler words |

### 2.2 Voice Layers

Each character has multiple voice layers:
1. **External Voice:** How they speak to others
2. **Internal Voice:** How they think/narrate
3. **Emotional Voice:** How voice shifts under stress/emotion
4. **Evolution Voice:** How voice changes over time

---

## PART III: CHARACTER VOICE PROFILES

### 3.1 Sheldon Tsukino

#### Internal Narration (Primary POV)
**Syntax:** Complex sentences with embedded clauses; scientific precision
**Diction:** Academic vocabulary deployed unconsciously; self-deprecating humor
**Rhythm:** Analytical, observational pauses; quick pivots to humor
**Imagery:** Scientific metaphors, cooking comparisons, occasional cosmic wonder
**Register:** Intelligent but not showing off; hiding depth

**Example:**
> *The probability of landing in a timeline where his fabricated documents would hold up to scrutiny was... actually, he had no idea. Statistics required data. He had memories, a wallet, and what appeared to be very convincing fingerprints.*

**Forbidden:**
- Simple declarative thoughts lacking analytical layer
- Pure emotional expression without intellectual processing
- Vocabulary that sounds like other characters
- Cosmic awareness before Year 1 dream

#### External Dialogue (Phase I)
**Syntax:** Shorter, more controlled than thoughts
**Diction:** Deliberately simpler; hiding education
**Rhythm:** Careful, measured; pauses before revelations
**Register:** Deferential to Katsuhito; warm to Tenchi; cautious to strangers

**Example:**
> "I don't know where I came from. But I can work. If you'll let me stay."

#### Evolution Notes
- Year 1: Most guarded externally, most analytical internally
- Year 5: More relaxed, humor emerging in speech
- Year 13+: Full integration of internal/external voices

### 3.2 Katsuhito/Yosho

#### External Voice (As Katsuhito)
**Syntax:** Archaic undertones; complete sentences; no fragments
**Diction:** Nature imagery; indirect wisdom; avoids personal revelation
**Rhythm:** Measured, patient; silence as speech
**Register:** Formal-casual blend; teacher mode default

**Example:**
> "A tree does not explain its roots to the wind. Neither must you explain yourself to those who do not need to know."

#### Internal Voice (If POV)
**Syntax:** Flowing, contemplative
**Diction:** 700 years of accumulated language; intentionally archaic
**Rhythm:** Long thoughts; patience in every observation
**Imagery:** Nature, time, swordsmanship, duty

**Forbidden:**
- Modern slang or casual contemporary speech
- Rushed conclusions
- Emotional outbursts
- Revealing cosmic knowledge casually

### 3.3 Tenchi (Age 5, Year 1)

**Syntax:** Simple, often incomplete; questions frequent
**Diction:** Child vocabulary; mispronunciations for hard words
**Rhythm:** Bouncy, interruptive; short attention span
**Register:** Open, trusting; no filter

**Example:**
> "Sheldon-nii! Sheldon-nii! Grandpa says the tree is special but he won't say WHY. Do YOU know why?"

**Forbidden:**
- Adult vocabulary
- Long complex sentences
- Philosophical observations (unless filtered through child logic)
- Emotional sophistication beyond age

#### Evolution Notes
- Age 5: Pure child voice
- Age 10: Growing maturity, still energetic
- Age 18: Serious with warmth; emerging hero voice

### 3.4 Rea

**Syntax:** Short, declarative; economical
**Diction:** Practical vocabulary; avoids emotional language
**Rhythm:** Observational pauses; speaks when necessary
**Register:** Protective-practical blend; reserved

**Example:**
> "He's in the kitchen. Been there since dawn." [Pause] "He made extra."

**Forbidden:**
- Lengthy explanations
- Emotional expressions unprompted
- Information about herself
- Casual chattiness

---

## PART IV: NARRATIVE VOICE

### 4.1 Close Third Person (Sheldon POV)

**Characteristics:**
- Filters everything through Sheldon's perception
- His vocabulary colors description
- His knowledge limits available information
- His emotional state affects tone

**Example:**
> *The shrine grounds spread before him, larger than they'd seemed from the steps. The main building—he didn't know enough Shinto architecture to name the style—sat solid and somehow welcoming against the treeline.*

### 4.2 Narrative Voice Consistency

**Maintain:**
- Sheldon's analytical filter on all observations
- His internal humor in descriptive passages
- His knowledge gaps reflected in narration
- Era-appropriate cultural observations

**Avoid:**
- Omniscient information Sheldon wouldn't know
- Description vocabulary outside his education
- Emotional narration that contradicts his processing style
- Modern cultural references from future

---

## PART V: VOICE DRIFT DETECTION

### 5.1 Warning Signs

**Within Scene:**
- Character uses another character's typical phrase
- Internal voice contradicts established pattern
- Vocabulary suddenly shifts register
- Rhythm breaks without emotional cause

**Across Scenes:**
- Gradual vocabulary expansion without justification
- Character thinking in ways foreign to them
- Narration style shifting from close third
- Catchphrases or patterns disappearing

### 5.2 Common Drift Errors

| Error | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Cross-contamination** | Character sounds like another | Tenchi using Katsuhito's syntax |
| **Author intrusion** | Writer's voice overrides character | Academic vocabulary from Tenchi |
| **Convenience simplification** | Complex voice simplified for ease | Sheldon thinking in simple declaratives |
| **Emotional override** | Stress changes voice too much | Sheldon losing all analytical thought |
| **Evolution confusion** | Future voice in past timeline | Year 1 Sheldon with Year 10 confidence |

### 5.3 Drift Severity

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Minor | Single phrase off | Note, may be intentional |
| Moderate | Paragraph-level inconsistency | Review and revise |
| Major | Scene-level voice loss | Stop, reread profile, revise |
| Critical | Character unrecognizable | Full scene rewrite |

---

## PART VI: VOICE MAINTENANCE TECHNIQUES

### 6.1 Pre-Writing Preparation

**Before Each Scene:**
1. Read character voice profile
2. Review recent scenes with character
3. Note emotional state for scene
4. Identify any evolution markers

**Warm-Up Exercise:**
Write 2-3 sentences in character's voice before scene begins

### 6.2 During Writing

**Checks:**
- Does this thought/line sound like THIS character?
- Would they use this word?
- Is the sentence structure theirs?
- Does the rhythm match?

**When Uncertain:**
- Read line aloud
- Compare to voice profile examples
- Check against recent dialogue
- Ask: "Who else might say this?"

### 6.3 Post-Writing Review

**Voice Audit:**
- Read dialogue aloud per character
- Check internal monologue against profile
- Verify narrative voice consistency
- Flag any concerns for revision

---

## PART VII: VOICE EVOLUTION TRACKING

### 7.1 Legitimate Evolution

Characters' voices should change due to:
- Relationship development
- Trauma/healing
- Age/maturity
- Cultural adaptation
- Significant events

### 7.2 Evolution Documentation

For each character, track:

| Year | Evolution Marker | Voice Change | Example |
|------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| 1 | Arrival shock | Most guarded | [quote] |
| 2 | Settling | Slight relaxation | [quote] |
| 5 | Family integration | Humor emerges | [quote] |
| 13 | Canon events | External/internal merge | [quote] |

### 7.3 Evolution vs. Drift

**Evolution:** Justified by narrative events, documented, gradual
**Drift:** Unexplained, undocumented, sudden
