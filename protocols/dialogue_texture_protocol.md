## Description

Ensures realistic, character-specific, and stylistically appropriate dialogue across all narrative content. Dialogue must serve characterization, advance plot, and maintain consistent voice patterns unique to each speaker.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Differentiate character speech patterns distinctly
- Monitor and balance exposition levels in dialogue
- Enforce conversational rhythm through strategic pause beats
- Prevent "talking head" syndrome
- Maintain cultural and temporal authenticity

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Layer subtext beneath surface dialogue
- Create memorable character catchphrases organically
- Balance dialogue density with action and description
- Ensure translation authenticity for Japanese cultural context

## PART II: CHARACTER VOICE PROFILES

### 2.1 Katsuhito/Yosho
**Register:** Formal, archaic undertones
**Patterns:**
- Speaks in aphorisms and indirect wisdom
- Rarely gives direct answers to personal questions
- Uses nature metaphors frequently
- Pauses before significant statements
- Avoids contractions in serious moments

**Example:**
> "A tree does not explain its roots to the wind."

**Avoid:**
- Modern slang
- Direct emotional statements
- Rushed responses

### 2.2 Tenchi (Age 5, Year 1)
**Register:** Child speech, energetic
**Patterns:**
- Simple sentence structure
- Interrupts with tangential observations
- Questions everything
- Mispronounces difficult words occasionally
- Uses "ne" frequently as confirmation-seeking

**Example:**
> "Sheldon-nii, why does Grandpa talk to the big tree? Does it talk back?"

**Avoid:**
- Adult vocabulary
- Complex reasoning chains
- Extended philosophical dialogue

### 2.3 Sheldon
**Register:** Educated but adapting, internal vs external voice difference
**Patterns:**
- Internal monologue: Scientific, analytical, self-deprecating humor
- External speech (Year 1): Careful, deferential, hiding intelligence
- Uses cooking metaphors unconsciously
- Pauses before potentially revealing statements

**Example (Internal):**
> *Four PhDs and you're intimidated by a five-year-old's question about trees.*

**Example (External):**
> "The shrine is... peaceful. I appreciate being allowed to stay."

### 2.4 Rea (High School)
**Register:** Reserved, observant, protective undertones
**Patterns:**
- Short sentences, economical speech
- Watches before speaking
- Protective statements about Tenchi disguised as practicality
- Rarely volunteers information about herself
- Uses silence as communication

**Example:**
> "Tenchi needs his dinner at six. He gets cranky otherwise."

## PART III: EXPOSITION MANAGEMENT

### 3.1 Exposition Limits
| Scene Type | Maximum Exposition % | Method |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Action | 10% | Interruptions, physical reactions |
| Dialogue-heavy | 30% | Break with action beats |
| Introspective | 50% | Internal monologue balance |

### 3.2 Information Delivery Techniques
1. **Salami Slicing:** Reveal information across multiple exchanges
2. **Interruption:** Cut exposition with action or another speaker
3. **Implication:** Let readers infer from context
4. **Conflict Embedding:** Deliver info through argument/disagreement
5. **Question Redirection:** Answer questions with questions

### 3.3 Forbidden Patterns
- "As you know, Bob..." constructions
- Characters explaining things they both already know
- Uninterrupted monologues exceeding 100 words
- Perfect recall of past events verbatim

---

## PART IV: RHYTHM AND PACING

### 4.1 Beat Structure
Every dialogue exchange should contain:
- **Action beats** (physical movement/gesture) every 3-5 lines
- **Pause beats** (silence, hesitation) at emotional peaks
- **Environmental beats** (setting reminders) every page

### 4.2 Sentence Length Variation
| Emotional State | Sentence Length | Example |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Calm | Medium (10-20 words) | Standard dialogue |
| Tense | Short (1-8 words) | "No. Not yet. Wait." |
| Reflective | Long (20-30 words) | Extended metaphors |
| Interrupted | Incomplete | "I was going to—" |

### 4.3 Silence as Dialogue
Document when characters choose NOT to speak:
- What could have been said
- Why they withheld
- What the silence communicates

---

## PART V: CULTURAL AUTHENTICITY

### 5.1 Japanese Speech Patterns (1989 Rural Okayama)
- Honorific usage reflects relationship status
- Dialect markers for village residents
- Formality levels shift based on context
- Generational speech differences

### 5.2 Honorific Quick Reference
| Relationship | Honorific | Usage |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Katsuhito → Sheldon | -kun (later: none) | Superior to younger male |
| Sheldon → Katsuhito | -sama (decreasing over time) | Deep respect |
| Tenchi → Sheldon | -nii (later: Sheldon-nii) | Older brother figure |
| Village → Sheldon | -san | Neutral respect |

### 5.3 Era-Appropriate Language
**1989 Vocabulary Restrictions:**
- No internet terminology
- No mobile phone references
- Limited English loanwords (less than 2000s)
- Television and radio as primary media references

---

## PART VI: SUBTEXT LAYERS

### 6.1 What Characters Mean vs. What They Say
For emotionally significant dialogue, document:
1. **Surface meaning** (literal words)
2. **Intended meaning** (what speaker wants to convey)
3. **Received meaning** (how listener interprets)
4. **Reader meaning** (dramatic irony layer)

### 6.2 Subtext Example
**Katsuhito (Day 1):** "The shrine has room for those who work."

| Layer | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| Surface | Employment offer |
| Intended | Testing Sheldon's character |
| Received | Conditional acceptance |
| Reader | Yosho sees something in Sheldon |

## PART VII: QA CHECKLIST

### Pre-Scene
- [ ] Character voice profiles reviewed
- [ ] Scene emotional temperature identified
- [ ] Exposition load planned and distributed
- [ ] Cultural context verified for era

### During Writing
- [ ] No identical voice patterns between characters
- [ ] Action beats placed every 3-5 lines
- [ ] Exposition balanced with interaction
- [ ] Subtext layer identified for key exchanges

### Post-Scene Review
- [ ] Remove speaker's name if voice is distinct
- [ ] Each speaker distinguishable by word choice alone
- [ ] Exposition does not exceed scene limits
- [ ] Scene rhythm intact (varied sentence lengths)
- [ ] Era-appropriate vocabulary confirmed

## PART VIII: INTEGRATION

### Related Protocols
- **Voice Fidelity Protocol:** Maintains consistency across scenes
- **Scene Memory Reinforcement:** Callbacks in dialogue
- **Tone Drift Guard:** Monitors emotional consistency

### Database Tags
When registering dialogue scenes, tag:
- `dialogue_density: high/medium/low`
- `exposition_load: percentage`
- `voice_characters: [list]`
- `subtext_present: boolean`
