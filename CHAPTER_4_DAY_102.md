### Sheldon

The morning after completion felt different.

Sheldon woke without the familiar weight of pending work, the mental list that had accompanied him through months of temple restoration. The railings were done. Both doors were repaired. The major projects were finished, leaving a kind of emptiness that wasn't unpleasant but required adjustment.

He lay in his futon longer than usual, listening to the house sounds. Tenchi moving through his morning routine. Katsuhito's footsteps on the engawa. The birds calling in the forest beyond. The shrine continued its rhythms regardless of what had or hadn't been accomplished.

Eventually Sheldon rose, dressed, and made his way to breakfast. The day stretched ahead without urgent purpose, and he found himself uncertain how to fill it.

"The village carpenter mentioned he has work," Katsuhito said, as if reading the thought. "If you're interested."

"I could go down today. See what he needs."

"There's no rush. The work will wait."

But waiting felt wrong. Sheldon had grown accustomed to purpose, to the structure that meaningful labor provided. A day without direction seemed like waste.

⁂

### Tenchi

Tsukino-san seemed restless at breakfast.

Tenchi noticed the difference immediately. The man ate quickly, his attention scattered rather than focused. His hands moved without their usual deliberation, drumming fingers on the table in a pattern that stopped only when he caught himself doing it.

"Are you okay?" Tenchi asked.

"Fine. Just... adjusting."

"To what?"

"To having finished something." Tsukino-san's smile was rueful. "It sounds strange. But I've been working toward the temple doors for months. Now that they're done, I'm not sure what to do with myself."

Tenchi understood more than the man probably expected. He'd felt something similar after his marathon training ended, after the Kai visit concluded. The space left by completed things could feel like loss even when it was victory.

"Grandpa says that's when you're supposed to notice what you couldn't see before."

"Your grandfather says a lot of things."

"Most of them are true."

⁂

### Katsuhito

The adjustment period was necessary.

Yosho recognized what Sheldon was experiencing. The completion of sustained effort often left a void that felt disproportionate to the work itself. The temple doors had been important, yes, but they had also been structure, had been purpose, had been a framework within which each day organized itself.

Without that framework, the days required different navigation.

"Walk with me," Yosho suggested after breakfast. "There are things to show you."

They climbed the familiar stairs, past the sections Sheldon had repaired, past the points where new railings stood. The path was evidence of months of careful work, each improvement visible to eyes that knew where to look.

At the top, Yosho led them not to the temple but around it, to a section of the grounds Sheldon had rarely visited.

"The storage buildings," Yosho said, gesturing to a cluster of small structures partially hidden by trees. "They have their own needs."

⁂

### Sheldon

The storage buildings were in worse condition than Sheldon had realized.

Three structures, each perhaps ten feet square, huddled beneath overgrown foliage. Their roofs sagged. Their doors hung askew. One had a visible hole in its wall where boards had rotted through.

"How old are these?"

"Older than the temple. They were here when my grandfather was young."

Sheldon walked the perimeter, assessing. The damage was extensive but not irreparable. Wood could be replaced. Roofs could be restored. The foundations appeared solid, which was the critical thing.

"What do they store?"

"Festival equipment. Ceremonial items used perhaps once a year. Things that matter enough to keep but not enough to repair the buildings that hold them."

The contradiction was clear. Items worth preserving in buildings not worth maintaining. Sheldon had seen similar logic before, in institutions that valued their archives while letting the archive rooms crumble.

"They need work."

"They need extensive work. More than one person could accomplish in a season."

"But someone should start."

Katsuhito's smile suggested this had been the intended conclusion.

⁂

### Tenchi

The storage buildings were exciting.

When Grandpa and Tsukino-san returned from their walk, they were discussing plans in low voices. Tenchi caught fragments: "roof first," "structural assessment," "winter before any interior work."

"What did you find?" he asked.

"New projects," Tsukino-san said. "Buildings that need attention."

"Can I help?"

"Eventually. The initial work is assessment, figuring out what needs to be done and in what order. That's not as interesting to watch."

"I could still watch."

The adults exchanged a glance. Something passed between them that Tenchi couldn't read, some adult communication that happened without words.

"Assessment begins tomorrow," Grandpa said. "Today is for rest."

"But Tsukino-san doesn't want to rest. He's restless."

Both adults looked at Tenchi with expressions that mixed surprise and something like respect.

"He's not wrong," Tsukino-san admitted.

⁂

### Sheldon

Rest proved impossible.

By midday, Sheldon had reorganized his workshop, sharpened every tool, and cleaned surfaces that were already clean. The nervous energy demanded outlet, and without major work to absorb it, minor tasks expanded to fill the void.

Finally he gave up on stillness and walked to the village.

The carpenter's shop was busy, two assistants working on what looked like cabinet components. The carpenter himself was bent over plans, making notations with focused concentration.

"Tsukino-san." He looked up with evident pleasure. "I hoped you might come down."

"I heard you have work."

"Several projects, actually. The Yamamoto family needs repairs to their storage building. The community center wants new benches. And..." He hesitated. "There's a commission I'm not sure about. A restaurant in the next town wants decorative screens. Shoji work. Very detailed."

"Why aren't you sure?"

"The design is complex. I could do it, but not as well as I'd like. I thought perhaps, with your skill..."

The offer was clear. Not just work, but collaboration. The carpenter was proposing partnership on something that exceeded his individual capacity.

"Show me the design."

⁂

### Katsuhito

The afternoon brought familiar rhythms.

Yosho tended the shrine grounds while Sheldon was in the village. Tenchi helped, his assistance now genuine rather than performative. The boy had learned which tasks needed doing and when, had internalized the patterns that maintained a sacred space.

"The storage buildings," Tenchi said while sweeping. "Are they really that old?"

"Older than I am. Which is saying something."

"Why didn't you fix them before?"

The question was practical, without judgment. Yosho considered how to answer.

"Some things wait for the right person. The buildings needed someone with particular skills, particular patience. Until Tsukino-san arrived, there was no one suitable."

"So they just... waited?"

"Many things wait. The skill is recognizing when the waiting is over."

Tenchi swept in silence for a while, processing. Then: "Like how I waited to see Kai again. Even though I didn't know I was waiting."

"Precisely like that."

⁂

### Tenchi

Tsukino-san returned from the village with papers.

Actual papers, drawings and measurements and notes that he spread across the workshop table. Tenchi peered at them, trying to make sense of the lines and numbers.

"What is this?"

"A project. Decorative screens for a restaurant."

"Are you going to build them?"

"I'm going to help build them. The village carpenter and I will work together."

The collaboration was new. Tenchi had seen Tsukino-san work alone, had watched him develop skills in isolation. This was different, was partnership rather than solitary effort.

"Is that better? Working with someone?"

"Different. Some things are better done alone. Others benefit from multiple perspectives."

"How do you know which is which?"

Tsukino-san looked at the plans spread before him. "Experience. Trial. Sometimes you try alone and realize you need help. Sometimes you try together and realize you'd do better separately. The learning is in the trying."

⁂

### Sheldon

Dinner brought conversation.

The three of them ate together as usual, but the talk wandered more freely than it often did. Katsuhito asked about the village, about the carpenter's proposal. Sheldon explained the screen commission, the complexity of the design, the way it would require skills he was still developing.

"Shoji work is intricate," Katsuhito observed. "Paper over lattice. The lattice must be perfect or the paper reveals every flaw."

"That's why the carpenter was hesitant. The stakes are high."

"But you accepted anyway."

"I accepted to try. The worst outcome is failure, and failure is instructive."

Tenchi listened with evident interest, tracking the conversation like he was memorizing it. The boy's attention had sharpened over months, his capacity for sustained focus now remarkable for his age.

"Will you practice first?" Tenchi asked. "Before doing the real screens?"

"Many times. The commission isn't due for months. There's time to learn properly."

"Grandpa says you should practice until the practice is boring. Then practice more."

"Your grandfather," Sheldon said, "continues to be full of good advice."

### Sheldon

The evening settled into familiar patterns.

Stars emerged. The forest sounds shifted from day to night. Sheldon sat in his usual spot, but the restlessness of the morning had faded. The day had found its purpose after all: not in completing work, but in discovering what came next.

The storage buildings would provide months of occupation. The screen commission would challenge him in new directions. The village carpenter's collaboration would develop relationships beyond the shrine. Each thread connected to others, weaving a fabric of belonging that grew more complex with every addition.

One hundred and two days. The counting continued, but it felt less like measurement and more like accumulation. Each day added to what had come before, building something larger than any individual moment could contain.

Tomorrow would bring assessment of the storage buildings. Examination of needs, cataloguing of damage, planning for repair. The cycle of work would begin again, following the pattern that gave structure to his days.

Sheldon found he was looking forward to it. Not just to the labor itself, but to the learning it would require. Each new project taught something about the materials, about the techniques, about himself. The education was ongoing, would remain ongoing, as long as he continued to engage.

That was the gift of useful work. It never truly ended. It only transformed, became something new that required fresh effort and offered fresh understanding.

One hundred and two days. And counting.
