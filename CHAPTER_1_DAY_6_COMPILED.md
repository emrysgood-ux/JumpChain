## Scene 6.1: Saturday Dawn

**Time:** 05:30 - 06:15

The morning felt different before Sheldon opened his eyes.

Something in the quality of the silence had shifted—not the absence of sound but its character, as though the shrine itself had tensed in anticipation of what this day would bring. He lay still for a moment, cataloging the familiar sensations: the futon's firmness, the cedar-smoke smell, the grey light beneath the shutter.

Six days. He had been in this existence for six days, and today would test whether any of it could last.

He rose without urgency but without delay, moving through the morning routine that had become automatic. The scroll in the alcove advised patience, or endurance. He was beginning to understand that both would be required.

The kitchen was already occupied when he arrived.

Rea stood at the counter, her hands moving through preparations, but her rhythm was slightly wrong—too precise, too controlled. The tension visible in her shoulders said everything her face did not.

"Good morning," Sheldon said.

"Good morning." She didn't turn. "The tea is ready."

He moved to the cabinet and began the familiar process of setting out cups. Six days of this, and his hands knew where everything was. But today the knowledge felt precarious, as though it might be revoked depending on what happened in the hours ahead.

"He usually arrives around ten," Rea said, answering the question Sheldon hadn't asked. "The 8:30 train from the city. The bus from the station takes about forty minutes, and then the walk up from the village."

"You've calculated it."

"Everyone calculates it." She paused, her knife still above the cutting board. "The whole household breathes differently when he's here. Even Tenchi, who loves him more than anything, changes when his father arrives."

Sheldon absorbed this. "Changes how?"

"He becomes what he thinks his father wants him to be. Brighter. More eager. More... performative." Rea's knife resumed its motion. "It's not conscious. Children do it naturally. But it's exhausting to watch."

The observation carried the weight of personal experience. Sheldon wondered if Rea had spent her own childhood performing, trying to become what various caretakers wanted, never quite succeeding.

"And you?" he asked. "Do you change?"

The knife stopped again. "I become quieter. It's easier that way."

She offered nothing more, and Sheldon didn't press. The morning was already heavy enough without adding questions that had no comfortable answers.

## Scene 6.2: Breakfast - Taut Strings

**Time:** 06:15 - 07:15

Breakfast unfolded under a tension that no one acknowledged directly.

Tenchi arrived in his pajamas, but his energy was different than usual—amplified, almost frenetic. He bounced in his seat, spilled his soup twice, asked a dozen questions about what time it was and whether the train was coming and what they would do when Daddy arrived.

"Eat your breakfast," Katsuhito said mildly, for the third time.

"But I'm not hungry. I'm too excited to be hungry." Tenchi pushed rice around his bowl with the distracted intensity of a child whose body had arrived at the table while his mind remained fixed on the future. "Uncle Sheldon, you have to show Daddy the house. The one you're fixing. He builds buildings, so he'll know if you're doing it right."

"I'd be happy to show him."

"And the carving! Show him the turtle. Grandpa says you made it yourself but I want to see Daddy's face when he sees it because he always makes a face when someone surprises him." Tenchi demonstrated the face—raised eyebrows, slightly open mouth—then dissolved into giggles at his own performance.

Katsuhito sipped his tea with the patience of a man who had weathered many such mornings. Rea ate in methodical silence, her eyes on her bowl, her presence contracted to its smallest possible footprint.

"What time is it now?" Tenchi demanded.

"Six thirty-two."

"That's forever! That's a million years!"

"It's approximately three and a half hours," Sheldon offered. "Less than the time between your breakfast and your afternoon snack."

Tenchi considered this recalibration with obvious skepticism. "That's still forever."

"Perhaps," Katsuhito said, "the time would pass more quickly if you finished your meal and helped Uncle Sheldon with the morning shrine duties."

The suggestion had its intended effect. Tenchi's eyes widened with the sudden possibility of useful action. "I can help? Really help?"

"If you eat first."

The boy attacked his rice with renewed purpose, shoveling food into his mouth with an efficiency that would have alarmed his mother. Rea watched with something that might have been amusement flickering beneath her careful neutrality.

Sheldon caught Katsuhito's eye across the table. The old man's expression was unreadable, but something in it suggested approval—of the distraction offered, the patience shown, the willingness to include a child in adult work.

It was, Sheldon realized, another test. Everything was a test today.

---

## Scene 6.3: Departures

**Time:** 07:15 - 07:45

The morning organized itself into departures, but Saturday's rhythm was different.

Tenchi had no school, but he had been invited to play at a friend's house in the village. The invitation had come earlier in the week, before he remembered that Saturday meant Daddy's arrival. Now he stood at the shrine gate, torn between competing desires.

"I could stay," he said, for the fourth time. "Yuki-chan would understand."

"Go play with your friend," Katsuhito said gently. "Your father won't arrive for hours yet. You'll be back long before he comes."

"But what if he comes early?"

"He never comes early. He comes when the train brings him and not a moment before." The old man placed a hand on his grandson's shoulder. "Go. Have fun. The waiting will be shorter if you're not watching the steps the whole time."

Tenchi wavered, then nodded. He hugged Sheldon's legs fiercely—"Don't let him come before I get back!"—and then raced down the steps with the particular speed of a child who wanted to get the obligation over with as quickly as possible so he could return to what really mattered.

Rea left shortly after, her school bag over her shoulder despite the half-day. She paused at the gate, turning back to face Sheldon and Katsuhito with an expression that held something unspoken.

"I'll be back by one," she said. "Tell him—"

She stopped. The words she had been about to say seemed to retract, pulling back into whatever guarded place she kept such things.

"Tell him what?" Sheldon asked.

"Nothing. It doesn't matter." She adjusted her bag's strap, a habitual gesture that bought time for emotional retreat. "Just... be yourself. That's what Katsuhito-sama always says, isn't it? Be yourself."

She turned and descended before anyone could respond, her footsteps quick on the stone stairs.

Sheldon watched her go, then looked at Katsuhito. "What was she going to say?"

"I don't know." The old man's voice was thoughtful. "But I suspect it was something she's been wanting to say to Nobuyuki for a long time. Something that has nothing to do with you."

The shrine fell quiet around them—the particular silence of Saturday morning, when the usual rhythms were disrupted and new patterns had not yet formed.

"Come," Katsuhito said. "There is work to do, and work makes the waiting easier."

## Scene 6.4: The Waiting

**Time:** 07:45 - 09:30

Time moved differently when weighted with anticipation.

Sheldon swept the courtyard stones with the careful attention Katsuhito had taught him, finding rhythm in the motion, letting the physical work occupy the parts of his mind that wanted to spiral into speculation. The morning light strengthened around him, shadows shifting as the sun climbed, and the hours stretched like taffy.

"You're getting better at that," Katsuhito observed, watching from the engawa. "The first day, you fought the broom. Now you let it work."

"You make everything sound like philosophy."

"Everything is philosophy. The question is only whether we notice." The old man sipped his tea, his posture relaxed despite the day's stakes. "Would you like to hear about the first time Nobuyuki came to this shrine?"

Sheldon paused his sweeping. "Yes."

"It was summer. Fifteen years ago, perhaps more. He was a university student then, researching traditional architecture for some paper or project. He arrived unannounced, walked up those steps with his notebook and his measuring tape, and stood in this courtyard looking like a man who had wandered into a sacred place and wasn't sure whether to apologize or take notes."

"What did you do?"

"I invited him for tea. It seemed the polite thing to do." Katsuhito smiled faintly. "He was so nervous he asked permission before sitting down. Asked permission before accepting the cup. Asked permission, I think, before breathing."

"He doesn't seem like the nervous type now."

"No. Grief has a way of burning away the smaller fears. When you have lost what matters most, the opinions of strangers cease to concern you." The old man set down his cup. "But the core of him remains the same. Careful. Observant. Wanting desperately to do the right thing, even when he's not certain what that is."

Sheldon absorbed this portrait of a man he had not yet met. "And Kiyone? When did she enter the picture?"

"That summer. He came back many times—always with questions about the architecture, always with reasons that seemed insufficient for the distance he traveled. By autumn, I think even he had admitted to himself why he kept returning."

"Did you approve?"

"I approved of his character. His nervousness. His willingness to be patient." Katsuhito rose from the engawa, moving to help with the sweeping despite having implied earlier that he wouldn't. "The rest—whether they were suited, whether it would last—that was not mine to decide. Parents rarely get to choose their children's hearts."

They worked in companionable silence for a while, the sounds of sweeping filling the space where conversation might have been. The shrine waited with them, ancient and patient, accustomed to the passing of hours.

"There is something else you should know," Katsuhito said eventually. "About Nobuyuki and Rea."

Sheldon stopped sweeping. "Yes?"

"When Kiyone died, there was discussion about what would happen to Rea. She was—is—not officially adopted. The legal status is complicated. Nobuyuki could have insisted she leave, return to the state system, find placement elsewhere."

"But he didn't."

"He did not. He said that Kiyone had chosen her, and Kiyone's choices deserved respect." The old man's voice carried something that might have been approval or might have been sorrow. "But it was not an easy thing. He barely knew Rea—his visits were infrequent, his connection to her minimal. Taking on that responsibility, in the depths of his grief..."

"It created distance."

"It created complexity. Rea knows that she was, in some sense, an obligation he accepted. A duty to his wife's memory rather than a genuine desire." Katsuhito resumed his sweeping, his movements precise and measured. "She has never quite forgiven him for being dutiful instead of wanting."

The psychology of it arranged itself in Sheldon's mind: a girl who had spent her life being unwanted, finally claimed by someone who wanted her, then inherited by someone who merely accepted her. The wound would be deep and probably permanent.

"Does he know?" Sheldon asked. "That she feels this way?"

"Nobuyuki is perceptive in some areas and blind in others. In matters of the heart, he tends toward blindness." The old man smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "He thinks his duty was enough. He cannot see that duty was the problem."

## Scene 6.5: Tenchi Returns

**Time:** 09:30 - 10:00

The yellow hat appeared at the top of the steps long before expected.

Tenchi came at a run, breathless and determined, his visit to Yuki-chan apparently cut short by an urgency no amount of playing could suppress. He burst into the courtyard and immediately positioned himself at the top of the stairs, peering down the descent as though his watching could summon his father faster.

"I couldn't stay," he announced to anyone who would listen. "What if he came early? He might come early. The trains sometimes come early."

"The trains come when they come," Katsuhito said mildly. "And so does your father."

"But what if—"

"Tenchi." Sheldon crouched to meet the boy's eyes. "The train he's on arrives at the station at nine-forty. The bus takes thirty-five minutes, and the walk from the village is twenty more. He cannot possibly be here before ten-thirty, no matter how much we wish otherwise."

The child's face worked through the mathematics, frustration warring with the irrefutable logic of time and distance.

"That's still too long," he said finally.

"Then we wait together. Waiting is easier with company."

Tenchi considered this, then nodded. He took Sheldon's hand and led him to the top of the stairs, positioning them both for optimal viewing of the approach below. The forest stretched downward, the path visible in glimpses between the trees, empty and patient.

"Do you think he'll like you?" Tenchi asked.

"I hope so."

"He has to like you. I already told him about you in my letters. I told him about the stories and the carving and the house." The boy's grip tightened on Sheldon's hand. "I told him you were staying. He has to like you because you're staying."

"People don't always like each other just because we want them to."

"But you're nice. You're really nice. And Grandpa likes you, and Rea-nee likes you even though she doesn't say it, and I like you best of everyone." Tenchi's voice carried the particular conviction of a child who believed that love could be made logical, that sufficient evidence would convince any skeptic. "So Daddy has to like you too."

Sheldon had no answer for this. The boy's faith was touching and precarious, built on foundations that might not survive contact with adult complexity.

They stood together at the top of the steps, watching the empty path, waiting.

Then—distant, almost imagined—the sound of footsteps.

Tenchi's whole body tensed. "Is that—"

"Listen."

The sound grew clearer. Steady, rhythmic, the particular pace of someone climbing three hundred and twenty steps without hurry. Not the scramble of a villager, not the careful steps of an elderly visitor. Someone who knew this climb, who had made it hundreds of times before.

"Daddy," Tenchi breathed. And then, louder: "DADDY!"

He released Sheldon's hand and ran to the very edge of the steps, leaning forward dangerously, his small body straining toward the figure that had not yet appeared.

"DADDY! DADDY, I'M HERE! I'M WAITING FOR YOU!"

And from somewhere below, a voice answered—warm, surprised, pleased despite the exertion of the climb:

"I hear you, Tenchi. I'm coming."

## Scene 6.6: Nobuyuki Arrives

**Time:** 10:00 - 10:30

The figure that emerged from the tree line was not what Sheldon had expected.

Nobuyuki Masaki was tall—taller than most Japanese men, though not unusually so by American standards. He wore weekend clothes that somehow still looked professional: pressed slacks, a collared shirt with the sleeves rolled to the elbow, leather shoes that had walked this path enough times to know its particular demands. He carried an overnight bag in one hand and a leather portfolio in the other, the latter identifying him as someone whose work followed him everywhere.

But it was his face that caught Sheldon's attention.

The grief Katsuhito had mentioned was visible there, not as an active wound but as something incorporated—lines around the eyes that spoke of sleepless nights, a set to the jaw that suggested sustained effort, a quality of tiredness that no amount of rest would cure. He had the look of a man who had been running for three years and hadn't yet found a place to stop.

Then Tenchi launched himself down the steps, and everything changed.

Nobuyuki dropped both bags and caught his son in a motion that spoke of long practice, sweeping him up into an embrace that eliminated all distance between them. Tenchi wrapped his arms around his father's neck and clung with the desperation of a week's absence, his small body trembling with the force of reunion.

"I missed you," Tenchi said into his father's shoulder. "I missed you so much. It was forever."

"I missed you too." Nobuyuki's voice had shifted—softer now, stripped of its professional edges, carrying only the raw tenderness of a parent reunited with a child. "Forever is a long time."

"It was though. It really was." Tenchi pulled back to look at his father's face, his hands framing Nobuyuki's cheeks with the proprietary certainty of childhood. "You look tired. Are you tired? Grandpa says you work too hard."

"Grandpa is probably right." Nobuyuki smiled, and the expression transformed him—softening the grief-lines, revealing the younger man he had been before loss had aged him. "But I'm here now. That's what matters."

They climbed the remaining steps together, Tenchi refusing to release his father's hand even when it made the ascent awkward. Nobuyuki retrieved his bags with his free hand, accepting the burden without comment.

Katsuhito waited at the top, his posture formal despite the familiarity between them.

"Nobuyuki. You arrived safely."

"Father." The word was respectful, careful—the term of a son-in-law who had never quite shaken his early nervousness. "Thank you for having me."

"You are always welcome here. You know this."

The exchange was ritual, repeated across countless visits, but something in it felt heavier today. Nobuyuki's eyes had found Sheldon, and he was doing what architects did—measuring, assessing, taking the dimensions of something he didn't yet understand.

"Father," Nobuyuki said, not taking his eyes off Sheldon, "would you introduce me?"

"Of course." Katsuhito's voice carried the particular gravity of a formal presentation. "Nobuyuki, this is Tsukino Sheldon. Michiko-san's nephew from America. He arrived last week to claim his inheritance and has been staying with us while he arranges repairs to the house."

Sheldon stepped forward and offered a slight bow—the appropriate depth for meeting a social equal, neither too formal nor too casual. "Masaki-san. I've heard a great deal about you."

"And I about you." Nobuyuki's bow was equally measured, his eyes never quite leaving Sheldon's face. "Tenchi's letters have been... detailed."

"He's enthusiastic."

"That's one word for it." The corner of Nobuyuki's mouth twitched—amusement or wariness, impossible to tell. "I understand you've been telling him stories."

"He asked."

"He would." Nobuyuki turned to his son, who was watching the exchange with the intensity of a spectator at a crucial game. "Tenchi, why don't you help Grandpa bring my bags inside? I'd like to talk with Tsukino-san for a moment."

The boy hesitated, clearly torn between obedience and the desire to witness whatever was about to happen.

"Go," Sheldon said gently. "I'll still be here when you come back. I'm not going anywhere."

Tenchi's face brightened at the familiar promise. He grabbed his father's overnight bag and ran toward the residence, calling for Katsuhito to follow. The old priest gathered the portfolio with deliberate slowness, his eyes meeting Sheldon's for just a moment before he turned away.

And then they were alone—the architect and the physicist, the grieving widower and the impossible stranger, standing in a shrine courtyard while an ancient tree watched them both.

"So," Nobuyuki said. "You're the American nephew."

"So I'm told."

"Michiko mentioned family in America. I never expected anyone to actually come."

"Neither did I." The honesty slipped out before Sheldon could calculate whether it was wise. "I mean—the inheritance was unexpected. I wasn't looking for anything when the letter arrived."

Nobuyuki studied him with the particular attention of someone who made his living reading structures. "You don't look much like her. Michiko."

"I'm told I favor my father's side."

"James Carter. The American who came to Japan after the war, married a local woman, and disappeared back to the States within a decade." Nobuyuki's voice was neutral, but something beneath it suggested he had done his research. "A colorful family history."

"I suppose it is."

"And now you're here. Repairing a house you've never lived in, staying at a shrine you had no connection to, telling stories to my son." The last words carried an edge—not hostile, but sharp. "You can see why I might have questions."

"I can."

"Good." Nobuyuki's gaze held steady. "Then you won't mind answering them."

"Not at all." Sheldon met his eyes without flinching. "Where would you like to begin?"

# SCENES 6.7-6.9: First Conversation, House Tour, Rea Returns

## Scene 6.7: First Conversation

**Time:** 10:30 - 11:30

They settled in the main room of the residence, the formal space reserved for guests and important conversations. Katsuhito had tea prepared—the good teaware, Sheldon noticed, reserved for occasions that demanded ceremony.

Nobuyuki sat with the controlled posture of someone accustomed to meetings, his legs folded beneath him with practiced ease. His eyes moved over the room with the particular attention of an architect, noting details Sheldon couldn't read—sightlines, proportions, the way light fell through the windows.

"Michiko spoke of family in America," Nobuyuki said, accepting his tea with a small bow of thanks. "In the years before she died, she mentioned it more often. A sister who had married a foreigner, a nephew she had never met."

"Yuki. My mother." The fabricated history came smoothly now, tested through days of repetition. "She left Japan in the sixties. I never knew much about her family here."

"And yet you came. When the letter arrived, informing you of an inheritance in a country you'd never visited."

"It seemed worth investigating."

"That's a long way to travel for something that merely seemed worth investigating." Nobuyuki's tone was neutral, but his eyes missed nothing. "Most people would have sent a lawyer."

"I don't have a lawyer."

"A theoretical physicist without a lawyer." The corner of Nobuyuki's mouth twitched. "That seems like an oversight."

"I prefer to handle things directly. Lawyers add complexity that's usually unnecessary."

Tenchi burst into the room before Nobuyuki could respond, unable to contain himself any longer. He wedged himself between the two men with the proprietary certainty of childhood, demanding his father's attention while simultaneously wanting to orchestrate the conversation.

"Daddy, did you ask him about the stories? He tells the best stories. One about a rabbit who tricked everyone, and one about a fisherman who fought the ocean, and one about—"

"Tenchi." Nobuyuki's voice was gentle but firm. "I'm talking with Tsukino-san right now. You can tell me about the stories later."

"But they're really good stories. And he's teaching me to carve! Well, Grandpa is teaching him and I'm watching but I get to learn when I'm seven and—"

"Later, Tenchi."

The boy subsided, but he didn't leave. He positioned himself against Sheldon's side with the deliberate strategy of someone staking a claim, his small presence a constant reminder of the attachment that had brought them all to this moment.

Nobuyuki watched the positioning with an expression Sheldon couldn't quite read. "You've made an impression," he said. "On my son."

"He's easy to make impressions on. He's four."

"He's four and a half, and he hasn't attached to anyone new since his mother died." Something flickered in Nobuyuki's eyes—not quite accusation, but close. "He talks about you in every letter. Uncle Sheldon this, Uncle Sheldon that. You've been here less than a week."

"Children are quick to form attachments."

"Some children. Not Tenchi. Not anymore." Nobuyuki set down his tea cup with careful precision. "He lost his mother three years ago. Since then, he's been... cautious. The counselors said it was normal, that he needed time to trust again. But time hasn't changed it. He's kept everyone at a distance."

"Except now."

"Except now." The architect's gaze was steady, measuring. "A stranger arrives, claims family connection, and within days my son is clinging to him like he's known him all his life. You can see why that might concern a father."

Sheldon met his eyes without flinching. "It would concern me too, in your position."

"Would it?"

"Yes. A child's trust is precious and easily exploited. Any father would want to know who was earning it and why."

Something in Nobuyuki's expression shifted—not quite approval, but perhaps the acknowledgment of understanding. "Then you won't mind if I continue asking questions."

"Ask whatever you need to ask."

The conversation continued, circling through topics that were simultaneously mundane and probing: Sheldon's academic career, his plans for the house, his reasons for staying at the shrine rather than finding accommodation in the village. Katsuhito contributed occasional observations, his presence a moderating force that kept the interrogation from becoming hostile.

Through it all, Tenchi maintained his position at Sheldon's side, occasionally interjecting to offer evidence of Uncle Sheldon's virtues, his small voice a persistent advocate that Nobuyuki couldn't entirely ignore.

By the time the conversation wound down, something had changed—not resolution, but the beginning of mutual assessment. Nobuyuki's suspicion remained, but it had acquired the quality of watchfulness rather than hostility.

"I'd like to see the house," Nobuyuki said finally. "Michiko's house. If you don't mind."

"Of course." Sheldon rose, his movement careful to avoid disturbing Tenchi, who had begun to drowse against his side. "I've been working on repairs. You might be interested in the progress."

"An architect interested in construction work. Imagine that."

They left Tenchi in Katsuhito's care—the boy protesting but too tired to fight—and descended together into the afternoon light.

---

## Scene 6.8: Tour of the Tsukino House

**Time:** 11:30 - 12:30

The walk down was conducted mostly in silence.

Nobuyuki moved through the forest path with the ease of long familiarity, his steps finding the worn stones without conscious attention. He had climbed this way hundreds of times, Sheldon realized—visiting his wife's grandfather, later his own son. The path was written into his body's memory.

"Kiyone loved this walk," Nobuyuki said, breaking the silence. "She said the forest cleared her mind. Made it easier to think."

"I'm beginning to understand that. The climb has a quality that demands presence."

"You notice things. That's good." Nobuyuki glanced sideways at him. "Kiyone was like that. She noticed everything. Said it was exhausting sometimes, but she couldn't turn it off."

They emerged from the trees, and the Tsukino house appeared before them—newly repaired roof visible even from this distance, the northeast corner now matching the rest of the structure's weathered integrity.

Nobuyuki stopped walking, his eyes moving over the building with professional attention.

"Tanaka's work," he said. "I recognize the technique. He's been doing roofs in this area for thirty years."

"He's very good."

"He is." Nobuyuki resumed walking, but his gaze remained fixed on the house. "The tiles are properly aligned. The foundation layer was done correctly—you can tell by the way the new work sits with the old. Someone knew what they were doing."

They reached the property's edge, and Nobuyuki walked the perimeter slowly, examining the structure from multiple angles. His portfolio remained in his hands, unopened, but Sheldon could see him taking mental notes—the architect's instinct impossible to suppress.

"You supervised this work?"

"I helped. Carried materials, held things in place, learned to read the ceramic for damage." Sheldon watched him watching the house. "Tanaka let me work alongside his crew."

"He doesn't usually do that. Tanaka is territorial about his projects."

"I offered to help without being asked. He seemed surprised."

Nobuyuki's expression shifted slightly—something that might have been reluctant respect. "Manual labor. Not what I expected from a theoretical physicist."

"My grandmother believed everyone should know how to work with their hands. 'A person who can only think is only half alive,' she used to say."

"She sounds like Michiko." Nobuyuki climbed the steps to the engawa, testing the boards with his weight. "Solid. These are the original planks—sixty years old at least. Someone maintained them well."

"Katsuhito arranged for periodic upkeep while the house was empty."

They moved inside, and Nobuyuki's assessment intensified. He examined walls, tested floorboards, ran his fingers along window frames with the particular attention of someone who understood how buildings aged. The water damage in the back corner drew his focus—he crouched to examine the staining, traced the path of moisture penetration, noted where the repairs had addressed the underlying cause.

"Good work," he said finally. "Thorough. You fixed the source, not just the symptom."

"Tanaka insisted. He said there was no point in patching visible damage if the hidden problems remained."

"He's right." Nobuyuki rose, brushing dust from his knees. "Too many people want quick fixes. They don't understand that buildings have systems. You have to treat the whole structure, not just the parts you can see."

The philosophy sounded like architecture and something else entirely. Sheldon filed it away.

They moved through the rest of the house—the kitchen with its ancient stove, the bedrooms with their tatami floors, the small office where Sheldon had found the photo album. When they reached the main room, Nobuyuki stopped.

The album still sat on the low desk where Sheldon had left it.

"You found her records," Nobuyuki said quietly.

"Yes."

"May I?"

Sheldon nodded, and Nobuyuki crossed to the desk, lifting the album with a reverence that spoke of personal connection. He opened it slowly, turning pages with the care of someone handling memories.

"I remember this day." His finger touched a photograph—Michiko in her garden, younger than in the later images. "Kiyone brought me here to meet her. I was terrified. This elderly woman who had raised her grandmother, who had known generations of the family. I thought she would see through me immediately."

"Did she?"

"Probably. But she was kind about it." Nobuyuki's voice had softened, the professional edge fading into something more vulnerable. "She said I had good hands. Hands that could build things. She said Kiyone needed someone who could build."

The observation landed with unexpected weight. Building as metaphor, as character assessment, as prediction.

"She sounds remarkable," Sheldon said.

"She was." Nobuyuki closed the album gently. "I didn't know her well. The visits were infrequent, and she kept her distance from Kiyone's city life. But she understood things about this family that I'm still learning."

"What kinds of things?"

Nobuyuki was quiet for a long moment, his eyes on the album's worn cover.

"That some places hold onto people," he said finally. "That the mountain has its own gravity. That those who belong here eventually find their way back, no matter how far they wander."

## Scene 6.9: Rea Returns

**Time:** 12:30 - 13:00

They were walking back when the encounter happened.

The path through the forest was wide enough for two people walking abreast, but Rea approached from ahead, her school bag over her shoulder, her face carrying the particular tiredness of a half-day that had felt like a full one.

She stopped when she saw them, her expression flickering through several emotions before settling into careful neutrality.

"Nobuyuki-san." Her voice was formal, proper—the tone of someone greeting a superior rather than a family member. "You arrived safely."

"Rea." Nobuyuki's response was equally measured. "You look tired. The commute again?"

"The commute is always the same." She adjusted her bag's strap—that habitual gesture Sheldon had learned to recognize as buying time. "I didn't expect you at the house."

"Tsukino-san was showing me the repairs. The work is impressive."

"He's been helping Tanaka-san." A slight pause. "Carrying materials. Working on the roof."

"So I've seen." Nobuyuki's eyes moved between Rea and Sheldon, reading something in the way they positioned themselves relative to each other. "You've been keeping an eye on things while I was away."

"Katsuhito-sama asked me to make sure the household ran smoothly."

"He always does."

The exchange was polite and distant, each word carefully selected, the space between them filled with things unsaid. Sheldon watched, aware that he was observing something he didn't fully understand—a relationship defined as much by its silences as by its speech.

"We should return," Rea said. "Lunch needs to be prepared."

"Of course." Nobuyuki gestured for her to proceed up the path. "After you."

She walked ahead, her pace neither slow nor fast, her posture carrying the particular tension Sheldon had come to associate with her. Nobuyuki fell into step beside him, and for a moment they walked together in silence, watching the girl who had been entrusted to his care without ever being fully claimed.

"She's grown," Nobuyuki said quietly. "Since the last time I was here."

"She manages a great deal."

"She always has. Even before—" He stopped, the sentence incomplete. "Kiyone said she was remarkable. That the damage hadn't broken her, only shaped her."

"The damage?"

"The institution. The placements that didn't work. The years of being unwanted." Nobuyuki's voice was clinical, analytical—the tone of someone describing a building's structural history rather than a child's trauma. "She came here with nothing except the clothes she was wearing. Kiyone gave her everything else."

"And now Kiyone is gone."

"Now Kiyone is gone," Nobuyuki agreed. "And Rea is still here, managing a household, attending school, caring for a child who isn't hers. Because I asked her to. Because I needed someone to do what I couldn't."

The admission hung in the air, heavier than it should have been.

"Does she know?" Sheldon asked. "That you see it that way?"

"I don't know what she knows. I don't know what anyone knows anymore." Nobuyuki's gaze remained fixed on the girl walking ahead of them. "I try to do right by her. I try to honor what Kiyone wanted. But I don't know if it's enough."

They climbed in silence after that, three figures on a mountain path, each carrying their own weight of history and obligation.

# SCENES 6.10-6.13: Lunch to Evening Preparation

## Scene 6.10: Lunch Together

**Time:** 13:00 - 14:00

The dining room felt different with Nobuyuki present.

Five places set around the low table: Katsuhito at the head, Nobuyuki and Tenchi on one side, Sheldon and Rea on the other. The arrangement had happened without discussion, bodies finding positions that reflected relationships Sheldon was still learning to read.

Tenchi had reclaimed his father the moment they returned, attaching himself to Nobuyuki's side with a grip that suggested he feared the man might vanish if not physically anchored. He narrated the entire meal, words tumbling over each other in his eagerness to share everything that had happened during the week—school, friends, stories, the house, the turtle carving, the way Uncle Sheldon knew about fireflies.

Nobuyuki listened with the particular attention of a parent hungry for connection, his eyes never leaving his son's face even as he ate. The tiredness Sheldon had observed earlier seemed to lift in Tenchi's presence, replaced by something warmer and more present.

"And Grandpa says the turtle means patience," Tenchi concluded, breathless from his monologue. "Because turtles are slow but they always get where they're going. Right, Uncle Sheldon?"

"That's one interpretation."

"Is there another one?"

Sheldon considered the question. "Turtles carry their homes on their backs. They're never far from where they belong, no matter where they go."

Tenchi's face scrunched with the effort of processing this. "So the turtle is about home?"

"Maybe about both. Patience and belonging. Some things are connected."

Nobuyuki watched this exchange with an expression Sheldon couldn't quite read—not hostile, but evaluating. Measuring the way his son turned to this stranger for wisdom, the ease with which answers were given and received.

"What are your plans?" Nobuyuki asked, the question slicing through the comfortable rhythm of Tenchi's chatter. "Long-term, I mean. Will you stay once the house is repaired?"

The table went quiet. Even Tenchi sensed the weight of the question, his small body stilling against his father's side.

"I haven't decided," Sheldon said. "I'm still learning what's here. What it means to have inherited something."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the only honest one I have." Sheldon met Nobuyuki's eyes directly. "I didn't come here with a plan. I came because a letter arrived and something in me said I should follow it. Everything since then has been... discovery."

"Discovery."

"Learning what this place is. What these people are. What I might become here, if I stayed."

The answer seemed to satisfy something in Nobuyuki, or at least shift it. He turned back to his meal, but the intensity of his focus had changed—less interrogation, more consideration.

Rea had remained silent throughout, her attention on her food, her presence contracted to its smallest possible footprint. But when Sheldon caught her eye across the table, he saw something that might have been gratitude—for answers given, or perhaps for the honesty of admitting uncertainty.

---

## Scene 6.11: Afternoon - Father and Son

**Time:** 14:00 - 16:00

Sheldon withdrew to the engawa after lunch, ceding space for Nobuyuki and Tenchi.

From his position, he could see them in the courtyard—father and son engaged in the particular play of weekend visits. They kicked a ball back and forth, Tenchi's laughter rising with each successful catch, Nobuyuki's movements growing looser as he shed the week's accumulated tension.

But there was something else visible too. The way Nobuyuki's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. The moments when he would pause, staring at his son with an expression that mixed love with something darker—guilt, perhaps, or the awareness of inadequacy.

Rea appeared beside him, having finished cleaning from lunch. She stood watching the scene with her arms crossed, her expression difficult to read.

"He tries so hard," she said quietly. "It's almost painful to watch."

"Painful how?"

"He wants to be enough. He knows he isn't." She paused, her jaw tightening. "He's away five days a week. Works twelve-hour days. Comes here on weekends and tries to compress everything into two days. Then leaves again, and Tenchi spends another week waiting."

"Is there another option? For him?"

"He could work less. He could move back to the village, take a job with a local firm." Rea's voice was flat, stating facts without judgment. "There's demand for architects even in rural areas. He could be here every day instead of two."

"But?"

"But the city work pays more. And the prestige matters to him—the important buildings, the impressive projects. He tells himself it's for Tenchi's future, that the money will matter someday." She turned away from the courtyard. "Maybe it will. But Tenchi doesn't need money. He needs his father."

The observation carried the weight of personal experience. Sheldon thought of what Katsuhito had said about Rea—that she knew she was an obligation, a duty to Kiyone's memory. She had spent her life watching people choose other things over her.

"You're hard on him," Sheldon said.

"Someone has to be." Rea's voice was sharp now. "Katsuhito-sama is too gentle. Tenchi is too young to understand. And Nobuyuki—" She stopped, her hands clenching at her sides. "Nobuyuki surrounds himself with people who tell him what a good father he is. How hard he works. How much he sacrifices. No one asks why he can't sacrifice his career instead of his son's childhood."

Sheldon had no response to this. The criticism was valid, even if it was harsh.

"He saved you," he said finally. "When Kiyone died. He could have sent you back to the system."

"Yes. And I'm supposed to be grateful for that forever." Rea's eyes met his, dark and steady. "I am grateful. But gratitude doesn't mean I have to pretend he's perfect. It doesn't mean I can't see what he's doing to his son."

She walked away before he could respond, leaving Sheldon alone with the sound of Tenchi's laughter and the complicated picture of a family trying to love each other across distances that couldn't quite be bridged.

---

## Scene 6.12: Carving Revealed

**Time:** 16:00 - 17:00

The afternoon sun had begun to soften when Katsuhito summoned them to the workshop area.

"I thought Nobuyuki might like to see what you've been working on," the old man said, with the particular smile of someone orchestrating a moment. "The carving."

Sheldon retrieved the turtle from where he had left it, wrapped in cloth on the workshop bench. He brought it into the light and set it before Nobuyuki, who had settled onto the engawa with Tenchi still attached to his side.

The block had transformed over the past days. What had started as rough wood was now recognizable—a turtle, not realistic but stylized, its shell bearing patterns that echoed the grain of the wood itself. The head was raised, looking forward, and there was something in its posture that suggested patience or perhaps determination.

Nobuyuki studied it in silence, his architect's eyes moving over the surfaces, the curves, the places where tool marks told the story of creation.

"You made this," he said finally. "In a week."

"Five days. With instruction."

"Five days." Nobuyuki lifted the turtle carefully, turning it in his hands. "The grain work is good. You followed the natural patterns instead of fighting them."

"Katsuhito-sama taught me that. The wood knows what it wants to become."

"He told me the same thing, years ago. When I first came here." Nobuyuki set the turtle down, his expression contemplative. "I didn't listen then. I was too eager to impose my own designs."

"What changed?"

"Kiyone. She was like this wood—she had her own grain, her own direction. I learned to follow instead of force." Something flickered in his eyes. "The buildings I design now are different than the ones I designed before her. More attentive to what's already there."

The connection felt significant—art as metaphor, craft as character revelation. Sheldon filed it away.

"Katsuhito-sama says he has good hands," Tenchi announced, unable to stay silent any longer. "And patience. He said patience is the hardest thing because you can't teach it, you can only learn it."

"That sounds like him." Nobuyuki looked at his father-in-law with something approaching warmth. "He said similar things to me, once."

"When you were nervous," Tenchi said confidently. "And asked permission to breathe."

Nobuyuki's eyebrows rose. "Who told you that story?"

"Grandpa. He tells me lots of stories. But Uncle Sheldon's stories are better because they have animals and tricks and things."

The adults exchanged glances—the particular look of people watching a child navigate the complicated landscape of family loyalty.

"I'd like to hear one of these stories sometime," Nobuyuki said. "If Tsukino-san doesn't mind."

"He doesn't mind. He tells them every night at bedtime." Tenchi's face lit up. "Tonight you can listen too! Both of you!"

The invitation hung in the air, charged with implications. Nobuyuki's expression shifted through several emotions before settling on something that might have been acceptance.

"Perhaps I will," he said. "If Uncle Sheldon is willing."

Sheldon nodded slowly. "I'd be honored."

## Scene 6.13: Evening Preparation

**Time:** 17:00 - 18:00

The kitchen had become sanctuary.

Rea moved through her familiar routines, her hands finding ingredients without conscious thought, her body following patterns established through years of repetition. Sheldon worked alongside her, silent now, the comfortable rhythm of shared labor replacing the need for words.

"It's going better than I expected," she said finally.

"The carving helped."

"The carving was smart. Katsuhito-sama knew it would be." She paused her chopping, considering. "Nobuyuki respects craftsmanship. Building things. He measures people by what they can create."

"And I passed the measurement?"

"You passed a measurement. There will be others." Rea resumed her work, her knife moving with precise efficiency. "He hasn't decided yet. About you. But he's stopped assuming the worst."

Sheldon absorbed this assessment. "What was the worst?"

"Predator. Con artist. Someone who saw Tenchi's vulnerability and exploited it." Her voice was flat, clinical. "It happens. There are people who target grieving families, who insert themselves into fragile situations. He had to consider the possibility."

"That's reasonable."

"It is. I considered it too, at first." She glanced at him sideways. "The first few days, I watched you constantly. Looking for cracks in the story. Places where the mask might slip."

"And?"

"Either you're the most convincing liar I've ever met, or you're actually what you appear to be." A slight pause. "I've decided on the latter. For now."

The conditional trust was as close to an endorsement as Rea seemed capable of giving. Sheldon accepted it without comment.

"Saturday dinner is special," Rea said, changing subjects with her characteristic abruptness. "It's the one time all week we eat as a real family. Nobuyuki here, everyone together, no rush to be somewhere else."

"What do you usually make?"

"Something elaborate. Kiyone-sama started the tradition—she said Saturdays deserved celebration, that surviving the week was worth marking." Rea's hands stilled for a moment, caught in memory. "She made it feel like a gift. Like we were lucky to have each other, even for just one night."

"And now?"

"Now I try to maintain what she built. The traditions, the rituals, the feeling of being family." Her voice was quiet now. "I don't know if I do it right. But I try."

Sheldon watched her work—this girl who had been unwanted, then wanted, then left to maintain a family she'd barely had time to join. The weight of what she carried seemed impossible for someone her age.

"You do it right," he said.

Rea didn't respond, but something in her posture shifted—a slight release of tension, as though permission had been granted for something she'd been holding too tightly.

They worked in silence after that, preparing a Saturday dinner that would matter more than most, for a household that was still learning what it meant to be complete.

## Scene 6.14: Saturday Dinner

**Time:** 18:00 - 19:30

The table had transformed.

Rea had outdone herself—the meal spread before them like a statement of intent. Grilled fish glistening with careful preparation. Vegetables arranged with artistic precision. Rice that gleamed in its bowls. Pickles and sides occupying small dishes around the central offerings. The presentation spoke of hours of work condensed into something that looked effortless.

"Rea." Nobuyuki's voice carried genuine surprise. "This is beautiful."

"Saturday dinner is special." Her response was simple, but something in her posture suggested she had been waiting for exactly this acknowledgment. "Kiyone-sama taught me that."

The meal began with the familiar rituals—the thanks, the careful distribution, the first tastes that set the tone for what followed. But the atmosphere was different tonight. The tension of the morning had faded into something more relaxed, the household settling into a configuration that felt almost natural.

Tenchi dominated the conversation as usual, but Nobuyuki's engagement was different now—less desperate to compress connection into limited time, more present in each moment. He listened to his son's stories with patience, asked questions that showed genuine interest, laughed at jokes that weren't quite funny with the warmth of a parent delighted simply by his child's existence.

"Tell Daddy about the fish man," Tenchi insisted, halfway through the meal. "The one who fought the ocean."

Nobuyuki's eyes moved to Sheldon. "The fish man?"

"An old story. About a fisherman who caught something he couldn't keep."

"Tell it. Please." The request came without edge—genuine curiosity replacing the earlier interrogation. "I'd like to understand what Tenchi has been hearing."

Sheldon hesitated, aware of the weight of the moment. Then he began, adapting the tale he had told at bedtime, shaping it for this different audience.

"There was an old man who lived by the sea. For eighty-four days he had caught nothing, and the other fishermen had begun to call him unlucky..."

The story unfolded through the meal, punctuated by eating, interrupted by Tenchi's eager additions ("This is the good part!"), accompanied by the sounds of family dinner. Sheldon found his rhythm, learned to pause for effect, adjusted his telling to include the listeners.

When he finished—the old man sleeping, the skeleton of the great fish a monument to what had been—there was a moment of silence.

"That's not a happy story," Nobuyuki said slowly.

"Not in the usual sense."

"But it's true." The architect's gaze was thoughtful. "It's about doing something important even when you know you can't keep it. Even when the victory will be taken from you."

"Kiyone liked that story," Katsuhito said quietly. "I told it to her when she was Tenchi's age. She said the same thing—that it was true, even though it was sad."

Something moved across Nobuyuki's face—grief, yes, but also something softer. The recognition that threads connected across generations, that some stories survived because they said what needed saying.

"Tell another one," Tenchi demanded, unable to let the moment grow too heavy. "Tell the rabbit one. With the tar baby."

"That one's for bedtime."

"But Daddy needs to hear it!"

"I'll hear it tonight," Nobuyuki said. "If Uncle Sheldon doesn't mind an audience."

The question carried weight beyond its casual framing. Bedtime stories were intimate—a ritual between child and caregiver, a space that traditionally belonged to parents. The invitation was an acknowledgment that this space had been shared, and perhaps could continue to be.

"I don't mind," Sheldon said. "The more listeners, the better the telling."

---

## Scene 6.15: Evening - The Verdict Begins

**Time:** 19:30 - 21:00

Bedtime came and went—the story told, Tenchi's eyes finally closing, the silence of a sleeping child settling over his room.

Nobuyuki had stood at the doorway throughout, watching his son listen, watching Sheldon tell. When it was over, he had crossed to the futon and pressed a kiss to Tenchi's forehead, staying there for a long moment that suggested he was memorizing something.

Now they sat on the engawa—Nobuyuki, Katsuhito, and Sheldon. The evening had cooled, the stars emerging in the gaps between branches, the shrine settling into its nighttime quiet.

Rea had excused herself earlier, retreating to her room with an efficiency that suggested she was giving them space. This conversation, she seemed to understand, was not hers to witness.

"I didn't know what to expect," Nobuyuki said, breaking the silence. "When Father wrote to tell me someone had arrived. A man claiming to be Michiko's nephew, moving into my son's life without warning."

"Reasonable concerns."

"They were. I thought about coming immediately—taking time off work, confronting the situation. Father advised patience." He glanced at Katsuhito. "He usually does."

"Patience is rarely wrong," the old man observed.

"But it's hard. From the city, reading Tenchi's letters, hearing about this Uncle Sheldon who told stories and worked on the house and made everything exciting..." Nobuyuki's voice carried the edge of something he'd been carrying all week. "I didn't know if you were real. If any of it was what it seemed."

"And now?"

"Now I've spent a day watching you. Talking to you. Seeing how my son looks at you." Nobuyuki turned to face Sheldon directly. "I still have suspicions. I probably will for a while. But I don't think you're a threat."

"That's progress."

"Is it?" A slight smile flickered across Nobuyuki's face—the first one he'd directed at Sheldon that felt entirely genuine. "I'm telling you I don't think you're dangerous. That's not exactly a ringing endorsement."

"It's honest. I prefer honest to enthusiastic."

They sat in silence for a moment, the evening sounds filling the space between them. Crickets beginning their nightly chorus. Wind in the trees. The particular quality of mountain quiet that Sheldon had learned to recognize as the sound of the shrine breathing.

"He hasn't been this attached to anyone since Kiyone died," Nobuyuki said quietly. "Not to the counselors, not to the teachers, not to anyone at his school. He's been careful. Holding back. And then you arrive, and within days he's dragging you everywhere, telling you secrets, calling you uncle."

"Children attach to whoever shows up."

"That's what I told myself. That's what the counselors said when I asked." Nobuyuki shook his head. "But it's not true. Tenchi has met plenty of people since his mother died. He's been polite to all of them and close to none."

"So what's different?"

"I don't know." The admission seemed to cost something. "I've been trying to figure it out all day. What you have that others don't. What Tenchi sees in you that he hasn't seen anywhere else."

Katsuhito stirred beside them, his voice gentle. "Perhaps he sees someone who stays."

The words landed with unexpected force. Nobuyuki's face changed—the controlled expression cracking slightly, something raw visible beneath.

"Is that what it is?" he asked, and his voice was rough. "Someone who stays?"

"I don't know what draws anyone to anyone else," Sheldon said carefully. "But I know what I've promised him. That I'll be here when he comes back. That I'm not going anywhere. That the house I'm fixing is close enough that he can visit whenever he wants."

"And you mean it? The staying?"

"I mean it."

Nobuyuki was quiet for a long moment. Then he reached into his pocket and withdrew something—a small card, pressed and professional.

"My contact information. If anything happens. If Tenchi needs anything while I'm away." He held it out. "You're not his family. Not legally. But you're here, and I'm not. That has to count for something."

Sheldon accepted the card. The gesture felt larger than its physical size—not quite acceptance, but acknowledgment. A door opening slightly.

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet." But Nobuyuki's voice had lost its earlier edge. "I'm still watching. I'll be watching for a long time."

"I'd expect nothing less."

They sat together as the evening deepened, three men in the darkness of a shrine, while an ancient tree watched them all and kept its own counsel.

---

## Scene 6.16: Night - First Night Together

**Time:** 21:00 - 22:00

The guest room felt different with Nobuyuki somewhere else in the house.

Sheldon lay on his futon, the journal open on his chest, his thoughts circling through the day's events. The arrival, the interrogation that had softened into conversation, the dinner, the bedtime story with two listeners instead of one. The card in his pocket—Nobuyuki's concession, however grudging, to reality.

From somewhere in the residence came the sounds of movement. Footsteps, quiet but present. A door opening and closing. Someone else unable to sleep.

He should stay where he was. Let the night settle. Accept that not all questions needed answering tonight.

But something drew him up anyway—curiosity, perhaps, or the sense that the day wasn't quite finished. He rose quietly, wrapped his yukata around him, and slid open the door.

The hallway was dark. He moved through it carefully, following the sounds that had preceded him, until he reached the engawa and saw the figure standing at its edge.

Nobuyuki stood at the boundary where wood met stone, his gaze fixed on the great tree. Funaho rose against the stars like a column of living darkness, its branches spreading in patterns that seemed almost deliberate, its presence filling the courtyard with something that felt like attention.

Sheldon hesitated at the door. Then: "Can't sleep?"

Nobuyuki didn't startle. "Do you feel it? The way this place watches."

"Yes."

"I noticed it the first time I came here. Fifteen years ago, a student with a notebook, and I felt something looking back at me from that tree." Nobuyuki's voice was quiet, almost reverent. "I asked Kiyone about it later. She laughed and said the tree liked me."

"What did that mean?"

"I never found out. She had a way of saying things that weren't quite answers." A pause. "Katsuhito does the same thing. I used to think they were mocking me. Now I think they just see things I can't."

Sheldon moved to stand beside him, both of them facing the tree. In the darkness, it was easy to believe the branches were moving—shifting, reaching, adjusting to better observe the humans at its feet.

"My first night here," Sheldon said, "I opened the shutter to look at it. I could have sworn it looked back."

"That sounds like madness."

"It probably is. But it felt true."

"Yes." Nobuyuki was quiet for a long moment. "That's the strange thing about this place. The things that should be madness feel true. And the things that should be true feel inadequate."

They stood in silence, watched by the tree, watched by the stars, watched perhaps by whatever had drawn Sheldon to this mountain in the first place.

"Thank you," Nobuyuki said finally.

"For what?"

"For telling Tenchi stories. For staying when you could have left. For being here even though—" He stopped, searching for words. "Even though none of it makes sense. Even though you have no reason to care about any of us."

"I have reasons."

"Do you?"

"They're not the reasons you might expect. But they're real."

Nobuyuki nodded slowly. "Then I suppose that's enough. For now."

He turned and walked back toward the residence, his footsteps quiet on the wooden boards. At the door, he paused.

"Tomorrow I'll leave again. Take the evening train back to the city. Tenchi will cry, and I'll promise to come back next weekend, and I'll try not to think about all the days in between."

"That sounds hard."

"It is. Every time." Nobuyuki's voice was rough. "But it's the life I've built. The life I keep choosing, even though it hurts. I don't know how to change it without losing something else."

"Maybe you don't have to change all of it. Maybe you just change what you can."

Nobuyuki considered this. "The things you can change," he repeated. "Yes. Perhaps."

He disappeared into the darkness of the hallway, leaving Sheldon alone with the tree and the night and the weight of a day that had shifted things in ways he couldn't yet measure.

The trunk of Funaho seemed to pulse with something—not light, exactly, but presence. Awareness. The sense of being seen by something ancient and patient and not entirely human.

*I planted myself here*, Sheldon thought. *And now we wait to see what grows.*

The night held its breath around him.

He turned and went back to his room, leaving the tree to its vigil.
