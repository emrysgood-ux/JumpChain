## SCENE 1.9: NIGHT WALK

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:00 JST**
**Location:** Shrine grounds, covered walkway
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The covered walkway was darker than Sheldon expected.

A few lanterns hung at intervals, their light soft and yellow, casting more shadows than illumination. The wooden boards creaked beneath his feet—a different sound from the daytime, when the creaks had been lost in the ambient noise of wind and birds and distant conversation. Now each step announced itself, a small declaration of existence in the quiet.

He walked slowly. There was no reason to hurry.

The shrine at night was different from the shrine during the day. The same buildings, the same paths, the same mountain rising behind everything—but transformed by darkness into something more essential. The decorative elements disappeared. The colors faded. What remained was shape and shadow and the sense of immense age pressing down from all directions.

The great tree was barely visible from here, but Sheldon could feel it. A presence at the edge of his awareness, patient and attentive. He wondered if trees slept. He wondered if this tree ever did.

*You are here for a reason. The reason will reveal itself when it is ready.*

Katsuhito's words echoed in his mind. Cryptic. Frustrating. And somehow, inexplicably comforting. There was an answer out there—an explanation for the field and the documents and the body that didn't hurt. He just had to wait for it.

Sheldon had never been good at waiting.

---

A night bird called from somewhere in the darkness—not the three-note song he'd heard in the field, but something lower, more mournful. An owl, perhaps. The sound lingered in the air, then faded into silence.

He paused at a point where the walkway opened slightly, offering a view of the shrine grounds. The moon was rising over the mountain—not full, but bright enough to cast faint shadows. In its light, the main hall looked like something from a woodblock print, all clean lines and ancient geometry.

*I should not be here.*

The thought arrived unbidden, and he examined it carefully. It was true, in one sense—he had no logical reason to be here, no explanation that would satisfy the version of himself that had existed before today. A dead physicist from Alaska did not wake up in Japanese fields. A man with no memory of the journey did not find houses waiting for him at the top of mountain shrines. These things did not happen.

And yet.

He was here. The shrine was real beneath his feet. The mountain rose behind him, ancient and patient. The stars turned overhead, the same stars his grandmother had pointed out in Georgia a lifetime ago.

*Maybe the reason I'm here isn't logical,* he thought. *Maybe logic isn't the right tool for this particular problem.*

It was a strange thought for a physicist. Strange and uncomfortable and somehow, in this moment, exactly right.

---

The guest room door slid open easily under his hand.

Inside, everything was as he'd left it—the low table, the window looking toward the mountain, the futon cabinet against the wall. His wallet and watch sat where he'd placed them, waiting to confirm that this was real, that he had possessions, that he existed in the world in a way that could be documented.

Sheldon stepped inside and slid the door closed behind him.

The sound of it—the soft thunk of wood meeting wood—had a finality to it. Day one, complete. Whatever this was, whatever had happened to him, he had survived the first day of it. He had found food, shelter, people who seemed willing to help him. He had a place to sleep and work promised for tomorrow.

*Water, food, shelter.*

Grandmother's priorities, met. The rest could wait.
