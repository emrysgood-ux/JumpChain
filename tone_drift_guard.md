## Description

Maintains consistent or intentionally evolving emotional tone across scenes, chapters, and arcs. Prevents jarring mood shifts while preserving the story's genre blend of slice-of-life warmth, found family drama, and occasional cosmic/action elements.

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Track tonal shifts across all narrative levels
- Flag sudden, unintentional mood jumps
- Ensure tone supports and reinforces genre blend
- Maintain emotional coherence for reader experience
- Allow intentional tonal evolution when narratively appropriate

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Establish tonal baseline for each phase
- Create tonal signature for recurring scene types
- Balance humor, warmth, tension, and weight
- Preserve emotional logic across timeline

## PART II: TONAL VOCABULARY

### 2.1 Primary Tone Categories

| Tone | Description | Indicators |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Warm** | Comfort, safety, domestic contentment | Soft description, gentle dialogue, physical comfort |
| **Tender** | Emotional vulnerability, intimacy | Internal reflection, careful touch, quiet moments |
| **Light** | Humor, playfulness, ease | Quick dialogue, physical comedy, wordplay |
| **Contemplative** | Reflection, philosophical weight | Internal monologue, nature description, stillness |
| **Tense** | Anticipation, unease, stakes | Short sentences, environmental pressure, body awareness |
| **Heavy** | Grief, existential weight, consequence | Dense prose, silence, physical sensation of emotion |
| **Urgent** | Action, immediate threat, momentum | Rapid pacing, sensory overload, incomplete sentences |
| **Wonder** | Awe, cosmic scale, beauty | Elevated language, vast imagery, suspended time |

### 2.2 Tone Blends (Son of Cosmos Signatures)

| Blend | Components | When Used |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Cozy Mystery** | Warm + Contemplative | Phase I daily life with hidden depths |
| **Earned Comfort** | Tender + Light | After emotional processing |
| **Gentle Tension** | Warm + Tense | Seeds being planted, something beneath |
| **Cosmic Intimacy** | Wonder + Tender | Cosmos bond moments, Year 1 dream |
| **Bittersweet** | Warm + Heavy | Memories of loss amid present joy |

## PART III: TONAL BASELINE BY PHASE

### 3.1 Phase I (Years 1-3): Establishment

**Dominant Tones:** Warm, Contemplative, Light
**Permitted:** Tender, Gentle Tension
**Rare:** Tense, Heavy (specific scenes only)
**Forbidden:** Urgent (no action sequences yet)

**Baseline Feel:** "A quiet place where healing happens slowly, with moments of wonder at the edges."

### 3.2 Phase II (Years 4-12): Development

**Dominant Tones:** Warm, Tender, Contemplative
**Permitted:** Light, Heavy (for revelation arc)
**Rare:** Tense (building toward Year 13)
**Forbidden:** Urgent (still pre-canon action)

**Baseline Feel:** "Deepening comfort with growing awareness that something vast waits beneath the surface."

### 3.3 Phase III (Year 13+): Expansion

**Dominant Tones:** Warm (core maintained), varied by arc
**Permitted:** All tones in appropriate rotation
**Rare:** Sustained Heavy without relief
**Required:** Return to Warm between major events

**Baseline Feel:** "The warm core persists even as cosmic events unfold around it."

## PART IV: DRIFT DETECTION

### 4.1 Tonal Transition Rules

**Permitted Transitions:**
- Adjacent tones: Warm ↔ Tender ↔ Contemplative
- Gradual shifts: 2-3 paragraphs between distant tones
- Scene boundaries: Reset with environmental description

**Flagged Transitions:**
- Warm → Urgent (requires significant narrative trigger)
- Light → Heavy (needs transitional beat)
- Wonder → Light (risk of undercutting)
- Heavy → Light (needs earned relief)

**Forbidden Transitions:**
- Urgent → Wonder (action cannot jump to awe)
- Heavy → Light (direct, without processing)
- Any tone → completely different tone in single paragraph

### 4.2 Drift Warning Signs

**Within Scene:**
- Dialogue tone doesn't match narration tone
- Character reaction mismatches scene tone
- Description shifts mood without cause
- Humor undercuts significant moment

**Across Scenes:**
- Back-to-back scenes of same intensity different tone
- No tonal recovery after intense scene
- Escalating tone without climax payoff
- Tonal whiplash between chapters

### 4.3 Drift Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Minor | Single paragraph tone mismatch | Note, may be intentional |
| Moderate | Scene-level inconsistency | Review, likely needs revision |
| Major | Chapter-level drift | Stop, diagnose, revise |
| Critical | Arc tone fundamentally off | Major restructuring needed |

---

## PART V: TONAL MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES

### 5.1 Setting Tone

**Scene Opening:**
- First paragraph establishes dominant tone
- Environmental description signals mood
- Character's physical/emotional state grounds reader

**Example (Warm):**
> "Morning light pooled on the tatami like spilled honey. Sheldon could hear Tenchi already awake, small feet pattering down the hallway, and something loosened in his chest."

**Example (Tense):**
> "The cave mouth breathed cold air into the summer afternoon. Sheldon stopped. Katsuhito had never explained the prohibition. He shouldn't be here."

### 5.2 Shifting Tone

**Gradual Transition:**
1. Signal change through environment first
2. Reflect in character's body awareness
3. Shift dialogue rhythm
4. Explicitly acknowledge shift in internal thought

**Example (Warm → Contemplative):**
> "Tenchi had fallen asleep against his arm. The kitchen was quiet now, dishes done, the day's work complete. Sheldon watched the stars through the window and wondered, not for the first time, what he was really doing here."

### 5.3 Returning to Baseline

**After Intense Scene:**
1. Time/scene break
2. Grounding sensory detail (comfort)
3. Routine action (familiar)
4. Character acknowledgment of shift
5. Return to baseline dialogue rhythm

## PART VI: GENRE BLEND PROTECTION

### 6.1 The Core Promise

Son of Cosmos promises: "A found family story with cosmic elements where the domestic warmth is the point, not a distraction from the 'real' story."

**This means:**
- Slice-of-life scenes are not filler
- Action/cosmic elements enhance, don't replace, warmth
- Humor supports, doesn't undercut, emotional moments
- Heavy content earns its weight, isn't gratuitous

### 6.2 Genre Tone Signatures

| Genre Element | Associated Tones | Protection Rule |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Slice-of-life | Warm, Light, Tender | Never absent more than 3 scenes |
| Found family | Tender, Warm | At least 1 expression per chapter |
| Mystery | Contemplative, Gentle Tension | Builds, doesn't overwhelm |
| Action | Urgent, Tense | Always followed by recovery |
| Cosmic | Wonder, Contemplative | Intimate, not alienating |

### 6.3 Preserving Warmth During Action

Even in Phase III action sequences:
- Pause for character connection moments
- Use found family dynamics during crisis
- Cooking/comfort callbacks post-conflict
- Never lose Sheldon's internal voice

## PART VIII: TONAL TRACKING

### 8.1 Scene Tone Log

```markdown
## Scene Tone: [Scene ID]

**Dominant Tone:** [primary]
**Secondary Tone:** [if blended]
**Intensity:** [1-5]

**Transition From Previous:**
- Previous scene tone: [tone]

```

### 8.2 Integration

Tag in [[scene_registry.md]]:
- `scene_tone: [primary]`
- `tone_blend: [if applicable]`
