## Son of Cosmos: Raising a Hero, Loving a Prince
## Compiled December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

**Period:** Years 5-12 (April 1993 - March 2001)
**Tenchi's Age:** 8→16 (Elementary 3rd Grade → High School 1st Year)
**Sheldon's Apparent Age:** 27-28 (aging has stopped; not yet noticed)
**Relationship Status:** Post-revelation; Sheldon and Yosho are partners/friends, slowly becoming more

These are the years between revelation and canon. Eight years of training, growing, waiting, and falling in love so slowly neither of them notices until it's already happened.

---

# PART 1: YEAR 5 (April 1993 - March 1994)

## 1.1 — Adjusting to the New Normal

**Status:** Six months post-revelation. Training has begun. The dynamic has shifted.

**What's Changed:**
- Evening sessions twice weekly (after Tenchi sleeps)
- Sheldon and Yosho use first names in private
- Conversations are deeper, more honest
- The masks remain in public, but slip in private

**What Stays Same:**
- Daily routine unchanged
- Public dynamic preserved
- Tenchi doesn't notice (he's 8)
- Village doesn't notice (they don't look closely)

## 1.2 — Training Year One

### What Yosho Teaches:

**Energy Awareness:**
- Feeling the flow of power in living things
- Sensing Funaho (Yosho's tree) from a distance
- Recognizing when someone is hiding their true energy
- NOT manifesting power — just perceiving it

**Control Exercises:**
- Suppressing night vision deliberately
- Activating it deliberately
- Cycling between states
- Maintaining control under stress

**Meditation:**
- Juraian breathing techniques
- Mental stillness
- "Feeling" without "reaching"
- The difference between passive perception and active power

### Session Structure:

**Location:** Shrine clearing, near Funaho, after dark
**Duration:** 1-2 hours
**Frequency:** Twice weekly (Tuesday, Friday usually)
**Format:** 
1. Breathing exercises (15 min)
2. Instruction/practice (45-60 min)
3. Discussion (30-45 min)

**The Discussions:**
These matter more than the training. Yosho shares:
- Stories of Jurai (carefully selected)
- Philosophy of power (Juraian perspective)
- His own journey (fragments)

Sheldon shares:
- His previous life (more detail now)
- His fears about his purpose
- His growing attachment to this life

## 1.3 — Tenchi Asks About Grandfather's Aging

### The Moment (Year 5, Winter):

**Context:** Tenchi (age 9) is doing homework. A question about family ages.

> "Sheldon-san, how old is Grandpa?"

Sheldon pauses. He knows the answer now — 730+. But he can't say that.

> "I don't know exactly, Tenchi. Old enough to be very wise."

> "But he doesn't LOOK that old. Yamamoto-sensei's grandpa is only 70 and he uses a cane. Grandpa doesn't use a cane."

> "Your grandfather is... strong. Some people age differently."

Tenchi accepts this. But he's filed it away. The questions will continue.

### Yosho's Response (When Sheldon Reports):

> "He'll figure it out eventually. Or I'll tell him. When he's ready."

> "When will that be?"

> "When he needs to know."

---

# PART 2: YEAR 6 (April 1994 - March 1995)

## 2.1 — Nobuyuki's Offer

### The Situation:

Nobuyuki, working in Tokyo, has been promoted. He now has a larger apartment. He could bring Tenchi to live with him in the city.

### The Conversation (Summer 1994):

**Nobuyuki to Tenchi:**
> "Would you like to come live with Papa in Tokyo? You could go to a city school. See movies. Go to arcades."

**Tenchi's Response (age 10):**
> "But... the shrine. And Grandpa. And Sheldon-san."

He doesn't say no immediately. He thinks about it for three days. Sheldon watches him process.

### Tenchi's Decision:

> "Papa, I want to stay here. Can you visit more instead?"

Nobuyuki is disappointed but not surprised. He agrees.

### Sheldon's Private Moment:

When he hears Tenchi's decision, Sheldon has to leave the room. The relief is overwhelming. The realization that he WANTED Tenchi to stay is... complicated.

He's not supposed to want things. He's supposed to be temporary. Helpful. Detached.

He's none of those things anymore.

## 2.2 — First Signs of Something More

### Between Sheldon and Yosho:

**Physical Proximity:**
- Training involves corrections (Yosho adjusting Sheldon's posture)
- These touches linger slightly longer than necessary
- Neither comments

**Evening Walks:**
- Started Year 4, now routine
- Sometimes they talk
- Sometimes they don't
- The silence is comfortable

**The Look:**
During one training session, Sheldon successfully senses a distant energy signature for the first time. He opens his eyes, excited.

Yosho is looking at him with an expression Sheldon has never seen before. Soft. Proud. Something else.

It's gone before Sheldon can name it.

### Neither Acts:

- Sheldon: Too much history of avoiding intimacy
- Yosho: 700 years of solitude make first moves impossible
- Both: Aware something is building
- Both: Not ready to address it

## 2.3 — Historical Context: 1994-1995

### Japan:
- Great Hanshin Earthquake (January 17, 1995) — 6,400+ deaths
- National trauma
- Aum Shinrikyo attack (March 1995)
- PlayStation launches
- Sheldon experiences this through TV, newspaper, village discussion

### How It Affects the Story:

**The Earthquake:**
- Village discusses it for months
- Shrine receives displaced visitors
- Sheldon helps coordinate aid donations
- First time he uses his organizational skills for community benefit

**National Mood:**
- Japan feels fragile
- The shrine becomes more important to villagers
- Sheldon's steady presence valued more

# PART 3: YEARS 7-8 (April 1995 - March 1997)

## 3.1 — Tenchi Asks About His Mother

### Year 7 (Age 11):

**The Question:**
> "Sheldon-san, what was my mother like?"

Sheldon didn't know Kiyone. He arrived after her death. But he knows this question matters.

> "I never met her, Tenchi. I'm sorry. But your grandfather tells me she was kind, and brave, and loved you more than anything."

> "More than Grandpa?"

> "In a different way. A mother's love is... its own thing."

> "Do you remember your mother?"

This hurts. Sheldon's mother died when he was 10. He barely remembers her.

> "A little. Not enough."

Tenchi hugs him. They sit together for a while.

### Following Up with Yosho:

That night, Sheldon tells Yosho about the conversation.

> "You should tell him more. About Kiyone. About her life."

> "Some things are hard to speak of."

> "He needs to know his mother, Yosho. Even through stories."

Yosho is silent. Then nods.

The next week, Yosho begins telling Tenchi stories about Kiyone. Sheldon doesn't attend these — they're private. But he sees Tenchi lighter afterward.

## 3.2 — Training Progress

### By Year 8:

**Sheldon Can:**
- Sense energy signatures up to 100 meters
- Control his night vision perfectly
- Recognize Yosho's energy (unique signature)
- Sense Funaho's presence (the tree responds to him now)
- Maintain meditative state under moderate stress

**Sheldon Cannot:**
- Manifest any offensive ability
- Use Light Hawk Wings (too early)
- Access his full potential (locked by Cosmos)
- Control the Lambda warmth consciously

### Yosho's Assessment:

> "You have remarkable potential. More than I've seen in any human. But it's... contained. Deliberately. Whatever made you limited your access for a reason."

> "She said 'when it's needed.'"

> "Then we train what we can. The rest will come."

## 3.3 — The Deepening

### Year 8 Milestone:

During a winter training session, Sheldon stumbles. Yosho catches him. They're suddenly very close.

Neither moves.

> **YOSHO:** (quietly) "Are you all right?"

> **SHELDON:** "Yes. I'm... yes."

They separate. Continue training. Don't discuss it.

But that night, neither sleeps well.

**This is the closest they've come to acknowledging what's building. It will take more years before either acts.**

# PART 4: YEARS 9-10 (April 1997 - March 1999)

## 4.1 — Middle School Begins (Year 9)

### Tenchi's Transition:

**Age:** 12-13
**School:** Middle School 1st Year
**Commute:** Longer (bus to town)
**Independence:** Increasing

**Changes for Sheldon:**
- Less daily contact with Tenchi
- More time during school hours
- New role: available when needed, not constantly present
- Letting go is hard

### The Natural Distance:

Tenchi has friends now. School activities. Interests outside the shrine. This is healthy. Normal.

Sheldon knows this.

It still hurts.

**Yosho's Observation:**
> "Children grow away from us. It's their nature."

> "I know. I just... didn't expect it to feel like this."

> "Like loss?"

> "Like watching something precious move beyond your reach."

> "He's not lost to you, Sheldon. He's just growing. He'll return. They always return."

## 4.2 — Year 10: Curiosity About Grandpa's Past

### Tenchi (Age 14) Investigates:

**What He Notices:**
- Grandfather knows things he shouldn't
- Historical details that don't match his supposed age
- Combat skills that seem impossibly refined
- The tree at the shrine feels... significant

**His Questions:**
> "Grandpa, where did you really come from?"

Yosho deflects. Not yet. Not ready.

> "Some questions are best saved for when you're older."

> "You always say that."

> "Because it's always true."

### Tenchi's Resentment (Mild):

He feels left out. Sheldon and Grandpa share looks. Private conversations. Something he's not part of.

**He doesn't confront them.** He's 14. He sulks sometimes. It passes.

**What He Doesn't Know:**
They're protecting him. The truth about Yosho. The truth about the cave. The truth about what's coming.

He'll know soon enough.

## 4.3 — Sheldon and Yosho: Eight Years In

### Where They Are (Year 10):

**Not Romantic Yet. Not Quite Friends. Something In Between.**

**What They Have:**
- Complete trust
- Physical comfort (touches don't startle either anymore)
- Deep conversations
- Shared responsibility for Tenchi
- Unspoken understanding

**What They Don't Have:**
- Any romantic declaration
- Physical intimacy beyond casual touch
- Clear definition of what they are

**The Pattern:**
- Evening walks (3-4 times weekly now)
- Training sessions (continuing)
- Tea after Tenchi sleeps
- Occasional moments of intense eye contact followed by looking away

**Yosho's Internal State:**
700 years alone. He forgot what wanting someone felt like. Now he's remembered, and it terrifies him.

**Sheldon's Internal State:**
A lifetime of avoiding intimacy. Work as substitute for connection. And now someone who sees him completely, and stays anyway.

Neither knows how to take the next step. So they don't. They wait.

# PART 5: YEARS 11-12 (April 1999 - March 2001)

## 5.1 — The Calm Before the Storm

### Year 11:

**Tenchi:** Age 15, Middle School 3rd Year
**Focus:** High school entrance exams
**Mood:** Stressed but capable

Sheldon helps with studying. Makes brain food. Keeps the shrine quiet during exam prep.

Tenchi passes his exams. Gets into a good high school.

**Celebration:**
Yosho, Sheldon, and Tenchi share a quiet dinner. Nobuyuki visits for the weekend.

For one moment, they're just a family celebrating a milestone.

### Year 12:

**Tenchi:** Age 16, High School 1st Year
**Change:** New school, new routines, more time away

**Sheldon's Role:**
Less caretaking. More... just being there. Tenchi comes to him when something's wrong. Otherwise, distance.

This is healthy. This is what "raising a child" looks like. The goal is their independence.

**Yosho's Mood:**
Pensive. He feels something coming. Funaho is restless. The cave energy fluctuates slightly.

> "Something is changing."

> "Should we prepare?"

> "We've been preparing for twelve years, Sheldon. All we can do now is wait."

## 5.2 — The Last Normal Year (Year 12)

### March 2001:

**Final Month Before Canon:**

- Cherry blossoms bloom
- Tenchi finishes his first year of high school
- The shrine hosts spring visitors
- Everything is peaceful

**The Final Night:**

Sheldon and Yosho sit on the shrine steps. Evening. Spring air.

> **SHELDON:** "Twelve years."

> **YOSHO:** "Twelve years."

> **SHELDON:** "It doesn't feel that long."

> **YOSHO:** "No. It doesn't."

A pause.

> **YOSHO:** "Whatever comes... I'm glad you're here."

> **SHELDON:** "Where else would I be?"

Yosho's hand covers Sheldon's. Just for a moment. Then withdraws.

They go inside. Separate rooms.

**This is as close as they've come. It's not enough. It's also everything.**

### The Next Morning:

Summer begins. Tenchi becomes more curious about the cave. The energy builds.

Canon is coming.

# PART 6: SHELDON-YOSHO RELATIONSHIP PROGRESSION

## 6.1 — The Five Phases (Years 4-12)

| Phase | Years | Status | Key Moment |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| **1: Revelation** | 4 | Trust established | "Tea After Midnight" |
| **2: Partnership** | 5-6 | Co-guardians | Training begins |
| **3: Friendship** | 7-8 | Genuine emotional connection | Tenchi asks about mother |
| **4: Unspoken** | 9-10 | Attraction acknowledged (to selves) | The caught stumble |
| **5: Waiting** | 11-12 | Both know, neither acts | "I'm glad you're here" |

## 6.2 — Why So Slow?

**Yosho's Barriers:**
- 700 years of solitude hardened into habit
- Last relationship: wife who died centuries ago
- Fear of loss (immortal watching mortals die)
- Uncertainty about Sheldon's feelings

**Sheldon's Barriers:**
- Lifetime of using work to avoid intimacy
- Emotional unavailability as defense
- Feeling unworthy (imposter in this life)
- Fear of changing something that works

**Together:**
They've found comfort. Companionship. Trust. Neither wants to risk that for something they might lose.

So they wait. And wait. And wait.

**When Does It Change?**
Canon forces it. When crisis comes, when life is at stake, when the world they've built is threatened — that's when waiting stops.

But for Years 5-12, they wait.
