## THE PREMISE

Sheldon Carter, a theoretical physicist with four PhDs, dies in a particle accelerator accident at the University of Alaska Fairbanks on October 23, 2025. Sailor Cosmos intercepts his soul and resurrects him as her First Son—the first male heir in a lineage of daughters spanning billions of years.

She places him in the Tenchi Muyo! universe in April 1989, twelve years before canon events begin. Tenchi Masaki is four years old. The typical harem dynamics are transformed: when the canonical female characters eventually arrive, they find a family already in place. Competition becomes belonging. Harem becomes household.

The story follows daily life without time skips, capturing the complete texture of existence over a millennium.

### Yosho's Powers
- **Yosho generates BARRIERS through Funaho, NOT Light Hawk Wings**

- **Kiyone MASAKI** — NOT Achika
- Achika does not exist in OVA canon

- Katsuhito/Yosho (permanent)
- Tenchi (permanent) — HARD CHANGE from canon
- Rea Masaki (permanent) — HARD CHANGE from canon
- Sheldon (Days 1-17, then moves to Tsukino house)

### Non-Residents
- Nobuyuki: Works in Kurashiki, visits weekends
- Tennyo: At Galaxy Academy (not on Earth)

## FORBIDDEN WORDS (Phase I)

Sheldon has NO meta-knowledge. Every thought must pass the test: "Has he learned this on-page?"

**Never use in Sheldon's POV until revelation (Day 366):**
- Cosmos, Sailor, Lambda, Moon Kingdom, Star Seed, Galaxy Cauldron
- Ryoko, Washu, Tsunami, Tokimi, Ayeka, Sasami, Jurai
- JumpChain, Jump, Perk, Phase

**He refers to his benefactor only as:** "the system," "the presence," "the warmth," "whatever brought him here"
