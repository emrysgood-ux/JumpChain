# SCENE 4.1: Fourth Dawn

**Date:** April 6, 1989 (Thursday)  
**Time:** 05:30 - 06:15

The morning arrived like an old friend.

Sheldon's eyes opened to the familiar grey line beneath the shutter, and his body knew exactly where it was before his mind had fully engaged. The futon's firmness, the cedar-smoke smell, the particular quality of mountain silence—all of it registered as *home* in a way that should have been impossible after only four days.

Four days. The number felt both impossibly small and unexpectedly significant. Enough time for his nervous system to stop treating every waking moment as a crisis. Enough time for the newness to sand down into something approaching routine.

He rose without urgency, his movements automatic now. Clothes from the hook. Feet finding the cool tatami. The scroll in the alcove still counseling patience, or endurance, and he had begun to think it meant both at once—that the two were perhaps the same thing in different light.

The journal on the low desk caught his eye as he gathered his things. He had begun it last night, the first words of what would become a record of this new existence. *Day 3. The beginning of something.* The ink had dried into permanence, a small claim staked against forgetting.

He would write more tonight. But first, there was morning to attend to.

The squeaky door announced him to the household, and he walked through its sound without flinching. The hallway was dim, the kitchen already glowing with warm light. The same as yesterday. The same as the day before. The rhythm of it settling into his bones like music half-remembered.

Rea was at the counter when he entered, her hands moving through the familiar motions. She glanced up—and today there was something different in her expression. Not quite a smile, but its cousin. The tight wariness of those first mornings had loosened.

"Good morning," she said.

Two words. Simple words. But she had not said them before—had only nodded, acknowledged, permitted his presence without greeting it. This was something new.

"Good morning," Sheldon replied. "The tea?"

She gestured toward the cabinet without speaking, and he moved to his task.

The water was already warm. The tea leaves waited in their canister. His hands knew the measurements now, the timing, the precise moment to remove the pot from heat before the water boiled. He moved through the preparation without thinking, which was its own kind of miracle—the body learning what the mind had only just discovered.

"You're going to the house today," Rea said. It was not a question.

"Yes. There's cleaning to do before Tanaka-san arrives tomorrow with the materials."

She nodded, her back to him as she worked at the counter. "The path is safe. But take water. The pump at the house—"

"Works," he finished. "I checked."

A pause. "That's good."

The tea was ready. He poured it carefully into the waiting pot, watching the pale green color develop. Four cups—Katsuhito would be awake soon, and Tenchi after that. The household's morning sequence was predictable now, a schedule written in footsteps and cooking smells and the particular quality of light through kitchen windows.

He set the pot on the tray Rea had prepared and lifted it to carry to the dining area.

"Tsukino-san."

He paused at the doorway.

Rea had turned from the counter. Her expression was composed, as always, but something worked behind her eyes—calculation, perhaps, or decision.

"The lunch," she said. "I will bring it. To the house. Around noon."

It was an offer. More than that—it was an initiative, something she had chosen rather than been asked for. The significance of it hung in the morning air like incense.

"I would appreciate that," Sheldon said. "Thank you."

She turned back to her work without responding, but the set of her shoulders had changed. Something had shifted between them, small but real.

He carried the tea to the dining area as the first true light of morning began to filter through the windows, and the fourth day began.

# SCENE 4.2: Breakfast - Tenchi's Anxiety

Katsuhito arrived at the table precisely as the light shifted from grey to gold, as though he had calibrated his movements to the sun itself. He settled into his place with the ease of decades, accepting his tea cup with a small nod that served as both greeting and gratitude.

Sheldon had already laid out the dishes Rea prepared—rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, a small piece of grilled fish for each place. The routines of service had become natural to him, another rhythm absorbed without conscious effort.

They ate in companionable silence for several minutes, the sounds of the morning settling around them like familiar music.

Then the patter of small feet announced Tenchi's arrival.

The boy appeared in the doorway still wearing his sleeping yukata, his hair a chaos of dark spikes, his eyes heavy with interrupted dreams. But when he saw Sheldon at the table, something in his face shifted—the sleepiness reorganizing itself around a brighter center.

"Uncle Sheldon!" He crossed the room at a run and climbed into Sheldon's lap without asking permission, settling against his chest like a nesting animal. "You're still here."

"Good morning, Tenchi." Sheldon adjusted his position to accommodate the sudden weight. "Of course I'm here. Where else would I be?"

"I don't know." Tenchi's voice was muffled against Sheldon's shirt. "Sometimes people go away."

The words carried weight beyond their simple construction. Sheldon caught Katsuhito's eye across the table and saw a brief flicker of something—acknowledgment, perhaps, or warning.

"I'm not going anywhere," Sheldon said. "I'm going to the house today to clean, but I'll be back before you come home from school."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi seemed to accept this, relaxing slightly. But something else was working beneath the surface, a different kind of tension visible in the way he picked at his rice once Rea brought his plate.

"Two more days," he said suddenly, unprompted.

"Two more days until what?" Sheldon asked, though he already knew the answer.

"Until Daddy comes." Tenchi's voice carried a complicated mixture of emotions—excitement and anxiety woven together so tightly they were impossible to separate. "He comes on Saturday. Every Saturday. Except sometimes he can't because of work, but Grandpa said he's definitely coming this time because he wants to meet Uncle Sheldon."

Across the table, Rea's chopsticks paused for just a moment. The motion was small, almost imperceptible, but Sheldon noticed.

"I look forward to meeting him," Sheldon said carefully.

"He's really tall," Tenchi offered, as though height were the most important characteristic a person could possess. "And he builds buildings. Big ones! Like castles but for people to live in."

"An architect," Katsuhito said, his tone mild. "A good one. His buildings are well-regarded in the city."

"He showed me pictures," Tenchi continued, his words tumbling over each other now. "They're so big. And he said when I'm bigger I can come see them. Maybe I can even go inside. He said there's one with a garden on the roof, like the shrine but up in the sky."

The child's enthusiasm was genuine but fragile, underpinned by something that sounded almost like pleading. *See how wonderful he is. See why I love him. Please see.*

"That sounds impressive," Sheldon said. "I'd like to hear about his buildings."

Tenchi beamed, but the brightness flickered. "Sometimes he's really busy. Even when he's here. He brings papers and has to talk on the phone. But Grandpa says that's because he works very hard to take care of us."

"That's true," Katsuhito said, and his voice carried a gentle firmness that redirected the conversation. "Your father works hard. Now—finish your breakfast. School waits for no one, not even those with important news to share."

Tenchi subsided, returning to his rice with renewed focus. But his body remained pressed against Sheldon's, seeking contact, seeking reassurance.

Rea rose to clear dishes that were not yet empty, her movements just slightly too quick. She caught Sheldon's eye as she passed, and in her expression he read something complex—warning, perhaps, or sympathy, or both.

"Rea-nee," Tenchi said through a mouthful of rice, "do you think Daddy will like Uncle Sheldon?"

The question hung in the air like a held breath.

"I think," Rea said carefully, "that your father wants what's best for you. And Uncle Sheldon has been very kind to you."

It was not quite an answer. Tenchi didn't seem to notice, satisfied by the words without examining them too closely.

Sheldon noticed.

The breakfast continued, the morning light strengthening through the windows, the household moving through its familiar patterns. But beneath the routine, something new was gathering—the anticipation of change, of judgment, of an outsider's assessment.

Nobuyuki was coming. And everyone, it seemed, was preparing in their own way.

# SCENE 4.3: Tenchi's Departure - Questions

**Date:** April 6, 1989 (Thursday)  
**Time:** 07:15 - 07:45

The morning had warmed by the time Tenchi was ready for school, the spring air carrying hints of the summer to come. The yellow hat sat slightly crooked on his head, his randoseru bulging with papers and the small stuffed rabbit he insisted on bringing despite Rea's gentle protests.

"I'll walk with you," Sheldon said, and Tenchi's face lit up as though he'd been offered a treasure.

They descended together, Sheldon matching his pace to the child's shorter stride. The steps were becoming familiar now—he had counted them once, found 320, and stopped counting. The number no longer mattered. What mattered was the rhythm, the way his body knew when to expect the turn, the landing, the stretch of open path.

Tenchi chattered as they walked, his words a continuous stream that required only occasional acknowledgment. School things: a friend who had a new pencil case, a teacher who told good jokes, a game they were learning in physical education that involved a ball and a lot of running.

Then, without warning: "Does Uncle Sheldon have a daddy?"

The question came from nowhere and everywhere, the way children's questions often did. Sheldon's step faltered for just a moment before he recovered.

"I had one," he said carefully. "He died some time ago."

"Oh." Tenchi processed this information with the matter-of-fact acceptance children sometimes showed toward difficult topics. "Like Mommy."

The words struck something in Sheldon's chest, a resonance he hadn't expected. In the fabricated history he carried, James Carter—his supposed stepfather—had died before Sheldon's return to Japan. In his real history, his actual father had died when Sheldon was nineteen, sudden and unexpected, a heart attack that came like a thief in the night.

"Yes," he said. "Like Mommy."

They walked in silence for a few steps, the morning birds calling around them.

"Grandpa says Mommy is in a place where she can see everything," Tenchi said. "Like the birds. She flies around and watches us and makes sure we're okay."

"That's a good thought."

"Do you think your daddy does that too? Flies around?"

Sheldon considered the question with the seriousness it deserved. His father had been a practical man, a mechanic who believed in things he could touch and fix. The idea of him flying anywhere—literally or metaphorically—would have made him laugh.

"I think," Sheldon said slowly, "that people we love stay with us somehow. Even when we can't see them."

Tenchi nodded as though this made perfect sense. "That's what Rea-nee says too. That Mommy is in the cooking and the cleaning and the songs."

The observation was startlingly sophisticated for a four-year-old. But then, grief aged children in particular ways, forced them to grapple with concepts most adults spent lifetimes avoiding.

"Rea-nee is wise," Sheldon said.

"She doesn't think so. She says she's just Rea-nee." Tenchi shrugged, the philosophical moment passing as quickly as it had arrived. "Look, there's the bus stop! Yuki-chan is already there!"

He pointed down the path to where a small figure waited near the road, another yellow hat visible in the distance. The village appeared below them, houses and shops arranged in patterns that were becoming recognizable.

"I have to go," Tenchi said, suddenly urgent. "But you'll be here when I come back? You promise-promised?"

"I promise-promised."

Tenchi launched himself at Sheldon's legs for a fierce, brief hug. Then he was running, his randoseru bouncing against his back, his yellow hat threatening to fly off with each stride.

"Yuki-chan! Wait! I'm coming!"

Sheldon stood on the path and watched until the small figure reached his friend, until the two yellow hats bobbed together in animated conversation, until the bus appeared around the distant curve and swallowed them both.

Then he turned and continued down toward the village, toward the house that waited with its dust and memories, carrying the weight of a child's trust like something precious and fragile.

# SCENE 4.4: Morning at Tsukino House

**Date:** April 6, 1989 (Thursday)  
**Time:** 07:45 - 12:00  
**Location:** Tsukino House  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 2,500

---

The house waited for him in the morning light, patient as stone.

Sheldon stood at the edge of the property and took a breath, centering himself the way his grandmother had taught him before any significant undertaking. The building looked different in early light—less abandoned, perhaps, or simply more ready. The roof damage was still visible, the weathering unmistakable, but something in the tilt of the windows suggested possibility rather than decay.

He had brought supplies from the shrine: cleaning cloths, a bucket, soap, the broom that Katsuhito had pressed into his hands with a knowing look. The water pump worked; he had confirmed that. The rest would require sweat and patience, both of which he had in sufficient supply.

The front door opened without protest, its hinges remembering their purpose. Inside, the main room spread before him in dusty silence, the furniture shapes hidden beneath their protective coverings like sleeping creatures. He had touched nothing on his previous visits except the photos on the mantle, the pump handle, the structure itself. Today was different. Today he would begin to claim this space.

He started with the obvious: sweeping.

The broom moved in long strokes across the wooden floor, gathering dust and leaves and the small debris of years. The motion was rhythmic, meditative, the same technique Katsuhito had taught him for the shrine courtyard. *The broom knows what to do. Your job is to get out of its way.*

As he worked, the room began to reveal itself. Beneath the dust, the floor was good hardwood, scratched but solid. The walls showed no signs of water damage except in one corner near the back, where the roof leak had done its work. The windows, once he wiped them, let in light that transformed the space from abandoned to merely waiting.

By mid-morning, he had cleared the main room and moved to the kitchen.

This space carried more weight. The old stove where Michiko—his "mother"—would have cooked. The counter worn smooth by decades of food preparation. The cabinet doors that opened to reveal dishes still stacked in their places, patterned plates in fading blues and greens.

He cleaned around these artifacts rather than moving them, not yet ready to disturb the archaeology of a life he hadn't lived.

The small room off the kitchen proved more interesting.

It might have been a study once, or a sewing room—the space was ambiguous, adaptable. A low desk sat beneath the window, and on it rested a leather-bound album he hadn't noticed before, its cover dark with age.

Sheldon lifted it carefully, feeling the weight of accumulated years. He carried it to the main room where the light was better and settled onto one of the cleared floor sections.

The first page held a formal photograph: a young couple in wedding attire, Japanese style. The woman was small and delicate-featured, her expression composed but with something bright behind her eyes. The man beside her—

Sheldon's breath caught.

The man looked like him.

Not exactly—the nose was different, the jaw softer—but the resemblance was unmistakable. This was James Carter, the American who had married Michiko Tsukino and become Sheldon's "stepfather." And the similarity between them was enough to explain why the villagers hadn't questioned Sheldon's appearance, why no one had wondered at his claiming of this house.

He looked like he belonged to this family. Because whoever—whatever—had created this backstory had made certain that he would.

The pages that followed told a story he had never lived. James and Michiko in front of this very house, young and hopeful. Michiko alone in the garden, older now, a baby in her arms—*him*, apparently, though the child could have been anyone. Family gatherings with faces he didn't recognize. Celebrations he couldn't remember. A life assembled page by page in fading photographs.

The final pages showed Michiko alone, much older, her face lined with years and something else—loneliness, perhaps, or patience, or the particular quiet of someone who had learned to wait. The last photo was dated in careful handwriting: *March 1988*. A year before Sheldon's arrival.

He closed the album gently and sat with it in his lap, breathing through the strange weight of inherited memory.

This woman had been real. Her life had been real. The happiness and sorrow captured in these photographs—all of it had actually happened, to actual people, in this actual house. Whatever power had placed Sheldon here had woven him into a genuine history, not a fabricated one.

The responsibility of that settled over him like a mantle.

He was not just claiming a house. He was inheriting a family's hopes, their disappointments, their decades of building something that had ultimately ended in an empty building and an unclaimed legacy. The least he could do was honor that—make something of what they had left behind.

The cleaning resumed with renewed purpose.

He worked through the morning, losing himself in the physical tasks. Cabinet doors wiped clean. Windows washed until they shone. The corner water damage assessed and marked for repair. The garden pump tested again, its water clean and cold.

By the time the sun had climbed to its zenith, the house felt different. Still old, still marked by years of emptiness, but somehow more alive. As though his attention had wakened something that had been sleeping.

He was standing in the garden, washing his hands at the pump, when he heard footsteps on the path.

Rea appeared at the property's edge, a cloth-wrapped bundle in her hands. She had changed from her morning clothes into something simpler, her hair pulled back more severely than usual. Her expression, as she surveyed the house and the man standing before it, was carefully neutral.

"You've been busy," she said.

"The house needed it."

She crossed the garden with measured steps, stopping at a distance that was respectful without being cold. The bundle in her hands turned out to be two bento boxes, neatly tied.

"Lunch," she said, offering them. "As I mentioned."

"Thank you." Sheldon accepted the boxes, their weight suggesting substantial portions. "Would you like to come inside? I've cleared enough space for sitting."

Rea hesitated—the first uncertainty he had seen from her. Her eyes moved over the house's facade, taking in details, assessing.

"Show me," she said finally. "What you've done."

It was, he understood, an acceptance of a different kind.

# SCENE 4.5: Rea's Visit - Extended

**Date:** April 6, 1989 (Thursday)  
**Time:** 12:00 - 13:00  
**Location:** Tsukino House interior  
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon/Rea)  
**Word Target:** 1,800

---

The main room looked different with another person in it.

Sheldon watched Rea move through the space, her eyes cataloging details with the precision of someone accustomed to maintaining order. She noted the cleaned windows, the swept floors, the careful way he had left certain things untouched. She said nothing, but her silence was evaluative rather than dismissive.

"Here," he said, gesturing to a cleared section near the back wall where the light from two windows converged. "It's the cleanest spot."

Rea settled onto the floor with the economy of movement he had come to associate with her—nothing wasted, nothing uncertain. She opened the cloth bundle and began arranging the bento boxes between them, her hands steady and sure.

"The house is sound," she said as she worked. "Katsuhito-sama said it would be, but houses surprise you sometimes."

"You've been here before?"

"Once. Years ago." She paused, her hands still. "When Kiyone-sama was still alive. She brought Tenchi to see his great-grandmother. Michiko-san was very old by then, but she wanted to meet him."

The information landed like a stone in still water, spreading ripples through Sheldon's understanding. Tenchi had been in this house. Had met the woman in the photographs. The connections were real, not fabricated—at least on that side.

"What was she like?" he asked. "Michiko."

Rea's expression shifted almost imperceptibly—a softening, perhaps, or a gathering of memory. "Small. Quiet. She held Tenchi like he was made of glass." A pause. "She had been alone for a long time. I think she had forgotten how to be around people."

Sheldon thought of the final photographs in the album, the woman aging alone in a house meant for family.

"She lost her husband," he said. "James. And then her son left for America and never really came back."

Rea's eyes met his, something sharp flickering there. "You know the story."

"Some of it." He kept his voice carefully neutral. "There are gaps."

"There always are." She returned to arranging the lunch, but something in her posture had changed—attention focused now in a way it hadn't been before. "Eat. You've been working since dawn."

The bento was excellent: rice, grilled fish, pickled vegetables, a small portion of something simmered with ginger. Rea had packed more than was strictly necessary, and Sheldon understood this as its own kind of communication.

They ate in silence for a while, the spring light moving slowly across the floor.

"The photographs," Rea said eventually. "You found them."

Sheldon glanced at the album, still resting where he had left it. "Yes."

"And?"

The question carried weight beyond its single syllable. He considered his answer carefully.

"It's strange," he said finally. "Seeing a life I wasn't part of. People I should know but don't remember."

It was as close to truth as he could safely get. Rea studied him, her dark eyes thoughtful.

"She looks kind," she said. "Your mother. In the photographs."

Sheldon nodded, not trusting his voice.

"I don't remember my parents either."

The words came quietly, almost casually, but Sheldon heard the depth beneath them. He waited, not wanting to spook whatever confession might follow.

"There was a facility," Rea continued, her eyes fixed on her bento rather than on him. "For children without families. I was there from the beginning, as far as I know. There are no photographs of me as a baby. No one to tell me what I was like."

The careful distance in her voice was familiar—the same distance he used when discussing things too large for ordinary emotion.

"Kiyone-sama found me there," Rea said. "I was... difficult, apparently. I didn't speak to the staff. Didn't play with the other children. They had decided I was broken. Unreachable." A pause, the ghost of something passing across her face. "She reached."

"How old were you?"

"Six, perhaps. Seven. The records weren't precise."

Sheldon set down his chopsticks, giving her words the attention they deserved. "And she brought you here? To the shrine?"

"Eventually. There were processes. Paperwork. People who had to be convinced." Rea's voice carried a thread of dark humor. "Kiyone-sama was very good at convincing people. She simply didn't accept no as an answer."

The picture was assembling itself piece by piece: a woman who adopted an "unreachable" child, who brought her to a shrine on a mountain, who gave her a family when none existed.

"She sounds remarkable," Sheldon said.

"She was." Rea finally looked up, met his eyes directly. "She would have liked you, I think. You have the same... quality."

"Quality?"

"Patience. The willingness to wait for things to make sense." Rea gathered the empty bento boxes, her movements brisk now, the moment of vulnerability passing. "She said that was the rarest thing. That most people couldn't bear not-knowing."

Sheldon thought of his own not-knowing—the vast unanswered questions that surrounded his existence here, the deliberate choice to wait rather than push.

"It's not easy," he admitted. "The not-knowing."

"No." Rea rose, the lunch packed neatly in her cloth bundle. "But it's necessary sometimes. To let understanding come in its own time."

She moved toward the door, then paused, looking back at him across the cleaned room.

"Thank you," she said. "For listening."

"Thank you for telling me."

Something flickered in her expression—acknowledgment, perhaps, or the beginnings of trust. Then she was gone, her footsteps quiet on the path outside, leaving Sheldon alone with the photographs and the dust motes dancing in the afternoon light.

# SCENES 4.6-4.7: Return and Shrine Duties

## Scene 4.6: Afternoon Return

**Time:** 13:00 - 14:00

The walk back to the shrine felt different with Rea beside him.

Not faster or slower—she matched his pace without apparent effort—but somehow more substantial. The path that had become familiar over these few days now held an additional dimension, seen through the awareness of shared company.

They climbed in silence at first, the spring air cool against skin warmed by morning work. The steps rose before them in their familiar count, but Sheldon had stopped marking them. The numbers didn't matter anymore.

"You came a long way," he said eventually. "For lunch."

Rea's stride didn't falter. "It's not far."

"Far enough. And you had shrine duties."

A pause, brief but noticeable. "The duties can wait. I wanted to see."

"See what?"

"Whether you meant it." She glanced at him sidelong, her expression unreadable. "People say they will fix things. Clean things. Make something of abandoned places. Usually they stop when it gets hard."

"It hasn't gotten hard yet."

"No." Something that might have been amusement flickered in her voice. "Not yet."

They continued climbing. The trees closed around them, the shrine's presence making itself felt before it came into view—that subtle shift in the air that Sheldon had learned to recognize.

"I don't remember my parents either."

The words came from Rea without preamble, continuing a conversation Sheldon hadn't known was still active. He waited, sensing more to come.

"At the facility, they told me my mother was young. Too young. My father was unknown—possibly a foreigner, they thought, because of my features." She spoke without emotion, reciting facts that had long since lost their power to wound. "I was left at a temple. The monks transferred me to the state system. The rest you know."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It's simply history." She paused at a landing, looking out over the forest they had climbed through. "But it means I understand something about being placed somewhere without choosing. About having to make a life from materials you didn't select."

The parallel struck Sheldon with unexpected force. She didn't know—couldn't know—how precisely her words applied to his situation. And yet.

"Yes," he said. "You would understand that."

They reached the shrine gate without further words, but something had shifted between them. Not quite friendship—Rea seemed to guard that word carefully—but something adjacent. Recognition, perhaps. The acknowledgment of shared experience across very different circumstances.

## Scene 4.7: Afternoon Shrine Duties

**Time:** 14:00 - 15:00

Katsuhito was waiting in the courtyard, his posture suggesting patience that had been tested but not broken.

"You return," he said, his tone dry. "I was beginning to think you had decided to become a hermit."

"The house needed attention."

"So Rea informed me." His eyes moved to his adoptive granddaughter, some silent communication passing between them. "She also informed me that lunch was delivered safely."

Rea's expression remained neutral, but something about her posture shifted—a slight stiffening, as though caught in an act she had hoped to keep private.

"The afternoon visitors will arrive soon," she said, deflecting. "I should prepare."

She moved toward the residence, leaving Sheldon alone with Katsuhito in the spring sunshine.

"Walk with me," the old man said. It was not a request.

They moved through the shrine grounds, past the main hall with its weathered wood and careful maintenance, past the stone lanterns that Sheldon now knew how to tend. The great tree rose ahead of them, Funaho, its branches swaying in a breeze that touched nothing else.

"Rea does not open easily," Katsuhito said. "You should know that."

"I've noticed."

"And yet she walked with you today. Brought you lunch. Shared conversation." The old man's voice was contemplative rather than accusatory. "You have done something unusual."

"I listened."

"Ah." Katsuhito stopped near one of the stone lanterns, adjusting something invisible in its placement. "A rare skill. More valuable than most realize."

They stood together in the afternoon quiet, the tree's shadow stretching toward them as the sun moved west.

"The visitors today," Katsuhito said, changing subjects with the ease of long practice. "A young couple from the village. They come seeking blessing for a child."

"Should I—"

"You should watch. Learn. There will come a time when helping with such things might be appropriate. But not yet."

The words carried layers—instruction, boundary, promise. Sheldon nodded, accepting all of them.

The visitors arrived an hour later: a man and woman in their late twenties, nervous and hopeful in equal measure. They approached the shrine with reverence, offered their respects, spoke quietly with Katsuhito about their hopes and difficulties.

Sheldon observed from a respectful distance, watching the transformation he had seen before. Katsuhito the casual grandfather became Katsuhito the priest, his posture shifting, his voice taking on qualities of ancient comfort. The ceremony was simple—prayers, offerings, blessings spoken in words that seemed older than the shrine itself.

When it was done, the couple departed down the long steps, their hands clasped, their faces lighter than when they had arrived.

"Does it work?" Sheldon asked, when they were alone again.

"Does what work?"

"The blessing. The prayers."

Katsuhito was quiet for a long moment, his eyes following the distant figures as they descended.

"I think," he said finally, "that belief is its own kind of power. Whether the divine answers or not, the act of asking changes us. Prepares us. Opens doors that might otherwise remain closed."

"That's not really an answer."

"No." The old man smiled, and there was something ancient in the expression. "But it's the best one I have."

## Scene 4.8: Tenchi Returns - Father Talk

**Time:** 15:00 - 16:00

The yellow hat appeared at the top of the stairs like a small sun rising.

"Uncle Sheldon!"

Tenchi came at a run, his randoseru bouncing, his face bright with the particular energy of a child who had spent hours being contained and now burst free. He launched himself at Sheldon's legs with an impact that spoke of absolute trust in being caught.

"You're here! You said you would be and you are!"

"Of course." Sheldon lifted him slightly, adjusting for the child's momentum. "I promised."

"I told Yuki-chan about you," Tenchi said, the words tumbling out. "About how you're my uncle from America and you tell stories and you're fixing the scary house. She said I was making it up but I wasn't. I told her you were real."

"I'm definitely real."

"I know." Tenchi squirmed down from Sheldon's grip and grabbed his hand instead, pulling him toward the courtyard. "Come look, I made something at school."

The "something" turned out to be a drawing, extracted from the depths of Tenchi's bag with ceremony. Crayons on rough paper, the colors bold and unsubtle in the way of all children's art.

"It's my family," Tenchi explained, holding it up for inspection.

Sheldon looked.

Four figures stood in front of a building that might have been the shrine or might have been any building anywhere. The tallest wore robes and had white hair—Katsuhito, unmistakably. Beside him, a smaller figure with dark hair pulled back—Rea. On the other side, a man in what appeared to be a suit, his expression a simple curved line of smile.

And in the middle, smaller than all the rest, a child with a yellow mark above his head that was probably a hat.

But it was the fifth figure that stopped Sheldon's breath.

Standing between Katsuhito and the suited man, rendered in brown and blue crayons with careful attention, was an adult who could only be him. The hair was the right color. The proportions were reasonable. And Tenchi had given him the same curved-line smile as everyone else.

"That's you," Tenchi said, pointing. "Uncle Sheldon. See? I put you in."

"I see." Sheldon's voice came out rougher than he intended. "You put me in the family."

"Because you are." Tenchi said this as though it were the most obvious thing in the world. "Grandpa said family is who you eat dinner with and we eat dinner with you every night. So you're family."

The logic was unassailable. Sheldon found himself without a response.

"Do you like it?" Tenchi's voice had shifted, uncertainty creeping in at the edges. "I worked really hard on the colors."

"I love it." Sheldon crouched to meet the boy's eyes directly. "It's the best family picture I've ever seen."

Tenchi's face broke into a smile so bright it seemed to generate its own light.

"I'm going to ask Grandpa to put it up," he declared. "In the special place where important things go."

He ran off toward the residence, clutching his drawing, leaving Sheldon alone in the courtyard with an emotion he couldn't name pressing against his ribs.

## Scene 4.9: Carving Lesson (Day 3)

**Time:** 16:00 - 17:30

The workshop area had become familiar now—the worn bench, the tools in their designated places, the wood shavings that accumulated like offerings to the craft.

Katsuhito sat across from Sheldon, watching as practiced hands moved the knife along the grain. The block had changed over these three sessions, its form emerging from the raw material like something waking from sleep. Not dramatic transformation—just gradual refinement, the shedding of unnecessary wood to reveal what waited beneath.

"Better," Katsuhito observed. "Your wrist is learning."

"It's strange," Sheldon admitted, not pausing his work. "The way the body learns differently than the mind. I understand the technique intellectually, but my hands had to discover it separately."

"This is the nature of craft. Knowledge and skill are not the same thing." Katsuhito reached over to adjust Sheldon's grip fractionally. "The mind can be filled with information. But the hands must be trained through repetition, through failure, through patient practice."

"Like the shrine work."

"Like many things." The old man's eyes held depths that suggested he spoke of more than carving. "Wisdom in general, perhaps. We can read about it, discuss it, understand its principles. But until we live it, it remains abstract."

Sheldon focused on a particularly difficult grain pattern, letting his body work while his mind wandered.

"Nobuyuki will want to know about you."

The statement came without preamble, another of Katsuhito's conversational ambushes. Sheldon's knife paused.

"What should I tell him?"

"The truth would be my recommendation. He has an instinct for deception—it comes from his work, I think. Architects learn to see what is hidden beneath surfaces." Katsuhito's expression was thoughtful. "But I suspect you know this already. That you are prepared."

"As prepared as I can be for meeting someone who's lost their wife and might see me as an intrusion."

"He might." Katsuhito picked up his own project—the eternal pipe he never seemed to finish—and turned it in his hands. "He has been protective of Tenchi since Kiyone's death. Watchful. Sometimes to excess."

"That's understandable."

"It is. And yet..." The old man set down the pipe. "Tenchi has drawn you into his family picture. He asks about you constantly. He has attached to you in a way he has attached to very few since his mother died."

"I noticed."

"Nobuyuki will notice too. Whether he sees it as positive or threatening depends on things neither of us can control." Katsuhito rose from the bench, indicating the lesson's end. "But I will say this: I believe you mean well. I believe you have good intentions. And I believe that is something Nobuyuki will eventually see, if you give him time."

"How much time?"

"However long he needs." The old man smiled, though it didn't quite reach his eyes. "He works hard, Nobuyuki. Perhaps too hard. Grief does strange things to people, makes them run toward exhaustion rather than face what waits in the quiet. He comes home on weekends and tries to compress all his fathering into two days. It's... imperfect. But it is what he can manage."

"You're preparing me for something."

"I am preparing you for a man who loves his son deeply but does not always know how to show it. Who may see your presence as either a blessing or a threat, depending on factors beyond prediction." Katsuhito moved toward the path that led back to the residence. "Be yourself, Tsukino-san. It is, ultimately, all any of us can do."

## Scene 4.10: Evening Kitchen

**Time:** 17:30 - 18:30

The kitchen had become a space of collaboration.

Sheldon stood at the counter, his knife moving through vegetables with increasing competence. Across from him, Rea orchestrated the evening meal with her usual efficiency, but something in the atmosphere had shifted since their lunchtime conversation.

"The carving," she said, not looking up from her work. "How is it progressing?"

Sheldon reached into his pocket and produced the block—he had taken to carrying it with him, working it whenever his hands were idle. The shape had clarified over the past days, no longer merely a rough form but something recognizable.

"Katsuhito-sama says the wood is deciding," he said, holding it out for her inspection.

Rea set down her knife and took the block, turning it in her hands. Her fingers traced the emerging curves, the careful cuts, the places where the grain had guided the blade.

"A turtle," she said.

"Maybe. It wasn't intentional."

"Things rarely are." She handed the block back, her expression thoughtful. "Turtles are patient. They carry their homes on their backs."

The observation hung in the air, weighted with meaning neither of them acknowledged directly.

"You're good at the cutting," Rea said, returning to her work. "The knife technique."

"My grandmother believed everyone should know how to prepare food. 'A person who can't feed themselves is a person at the mercy of others.'"

"She sounds wise."

"She was." Sheldon picked up his own knife, resuming the steady rhythm of slicing. "Stubborn and practical and occasionally terrifying. But wise."

Rea made a small sound that might have been agreement or might have been acknowledgment.

They worked in silence for a while, the domestic sounds of dinner preparation filling the space between them. At the table in the adjacent room, Tenchi was working on another drawing, his tongue poking out in concentration.

"The picture he made," Rea said quietly. "The family one."

"Yes?"

"He put you in it." Her voice was neutral, but something worked beneath the surface. "He has not added anyone to that picture in two years. Since his mother died."

Sheldon didn't know how to respond. The weight of the statement was too heavy for ordinary words.

"I think," Rea continued, still not looking at him, "that Kiyone-sama would be glad. That someone is helping him remember how to expand his world."

It was, Sheldon understood, the closest thing to a blessing she was capable of giving.

"Thank you," he said.

Rea nodded once, sharply, and returned to her cooking.

In the next room, Tenchi held up his newest drawing—Uncle Sheldon standing next to the "scary house," which now looked slightly less scary and more like a home.

## Scene 4.11: Dinner - Nobuyuki Stories

**Time:** 18:30 - 19:30

Dinner unfolded in the usual pattern: rice and fish and pickled things, the sounds of chopsticks and quiet conversation. But tonight the talk turned naturally toward the figure who would arrive in two days.

"Daddy built a building with a hundred windows," Tenchi announced through a mouthful of rice. "A HUNDRED."

"Chew before speaking," Rea said automatically.

"He did, though. He showed me pictures."

"Your father builds many things," Katsuhito said, his voice warm with something that might have been pride. "He has a gift for seeing what a space wants to become."

"Like Uncle Sheldon with the wood?" Tenchi asked, making the connection with the instinctive logic of childhood.

"In some ways, yes. Architecture and carving share certain principles—understanding materials, working with rather than against their nature."

Sheldon listened, building a picture of the man he would meet. Katsuhito spoke of Nobuyuki with the careful affection of family—acknowledging flaws without condemning them, honoring virtues without inflating them.

"They met here, you know," Katsuhito said, addressing Sheldon more directly. "Nobuyuki and my daughter. At this shrine."

"I didn't know that."

"He came as a student, researching traditional architecture for a university project. Kiyone was helping with shrine duties that summer." A slight smile crossed the old man's face. "She said later that she knew within the first hour. He took somewhat longer to realize."

"How long?"

"Three years of correspondence and visits before he finally worked up the courage to propose." Katsuhito shook his head with fond exasperation. "For a man who designs buildings full of bold lines, he was remarkably timid in matters of the heart."

Tenchi was listening with unusual attention, his rice forgotten. "Tell the story about the waterfall," he demanded.

"You've heard it a hundred times."

"I want Uncle Sheldon to hear it."

Katsuhito looked at Sheldon, raising an eyebrow as if to ask permission. Sheldon nodded.

"Very well." The old man set down his chopsticks, settling into the posture of a storyteller. "There is a waterfall, not far from here. It's not large—perhaps the height of two men standing—but it creates a pool that is quite deep. Your father, in his first summer visiting us, decided he would impress your mother by swimming in it."

"But he couldn't swim!" Tenchi interjected, clearly knowing the story by heart.

"He could swim somewhat. But the water was colder than he expected, and deeper, and he misjudged his entry rather badly." Katsuhito's eyes crinkled with memory. "Your mother dove in after him. Fully clothed. She dragged him to the bank, gave him a thorough scolding about overconfidence, and then—according to Nobuyuki—kissed him for the first time."

"While yelling at him," Tenchi added gleefully.

"Indeed. Their relationship has always had that quality—passion expressed through intensity, whether positive or negative." Katsuhito picked up his chopsticks again. "But we digress. Finish your dinner."

Sheldon noticed that Rea had remained silent throughout the story, her expression carefully neutral. When she caught him looking, she turned away, gathering dishes that weren't quite empty.

The picture of Nobuyuki was forming: a man of bold professional vision but personal uncertainty. A man who had been saved—literally and figuratively—by a woman who was no longer alive. A man trying to compress all his love into weekend visits while the weekdays consumed him with work.

It was, Sheldon thought, a formula for complicated grief. And he would be walking into the middle of it.

---

## Scene 4.12: Story Time - The Fisherman

**Time:** 19:30 - 20:15

Tenchi's room smelled of crayons and sleep, the particular scent of childhood spaces. The boy lay in his futon, surrounded by stuffed animals, his eyes bright with anticipation.

"What kind of story tonight?" Sheldon asked, settling into his now-familiar position beside the bed.

"A brave story. About someone who fights even when it's hard."

Sheldon considered for a moment, then began.

"There was once an old man who lived by the sea. He fished every day, going out in his small boat to catch what the ocean would give him. But he had been unlucky for many weeks—catching nothing, returning empty-handed while the younger fishermen brought home great catches."

"That's sad," Tenchi said.

"It was. But the old man didn't give up. He told himself that his luck would change, that somewhere in the deep water, a great fish was waiting for him."

The story unfolded—the massive fish that finally took the bait, the struggle that lasted days, the man's determination even as his body failed him. Sheldon adapted the Hemingway tale for a child's understanding, simplifying without diminishing, preserving the essential truth while adjusting the details.

"But the sharks ate his fish," Tenchi said, when the story reached its conclusion. "He didn't get to keep it."

"No. He didn't."

"So he lost?"

"That depends on what you think winning means." Sheldon chose his words carefully. "He fought as hard as he could. He didn't give up even when everything seemed impossible. And when he came back to shore, everyone knew what he had done. He had faced something enormous and refused to surrender."

"But he still didn't have a fish."

"No. But he had something else." Sheldon met the boy's eyes. "He had the knowledge that he could face the hardest thing he'd ever done and not break. Sometimes that matters more than the fish."

Tenchi was quiet for a long moment, processing.

"Like Mommy," he said finally, his voice small. "She fought really hard too. Even when it was hard."

Sheldon's heart seized. He hadn't intended this direction, but children found their own meanings in stories.

"Yes," he said. "Like Mommy."

"And she didn't break either."

"No. She never broke."

Tenchi rolled over, tucking his stuffed bear more securely under his arm. "I want to be like that. When things are hard."

"You already are." Sheldon pulled the blanket up slightly, tucking it around the small form. "Every day you get up and go to school and do your best and come home and be kind to the people who love you. That takes courage too."

"Does it?"

"More than you know."

Tenchi's eyes were closing, sleep pulling at him despite his resistance. "Uncle Sheldon?"

"Yes?"

"I'm glad you came to live here."

The words, simple and direct, carried weight beyond their construction.

"So am I," Sheldon said. "Sleep now."

---

## Scene 4.13: Evening Conversation

**Time:** 20:15 - 21:00

The engawa had become their meeting place, Sheldon realized. The space between inside and outside where conversations happened that couldn't quite manage in the full light of day.

Katsuhito was already seated when Sheldon emerged from Tenchi's room, two cups of tea waiting in the cooling evening air.

"He sleeps?" the old man asked.

"He's getting there. We talked about fishing."

"Ah. The Hemingway."

"You know it?"

"I have read widely over the years." Katsuhito lifted his cup, the steam curling into the darkness. "Not all of my time has been spent sweeping shrine courtyards."

They sat in silence for a while, watching the stars emerge through gaps in the canopy.

"Nobuyuki will arrive Saturday morning," Katsuhito said eventually. "The early train. He usually comes for dinner, but he wishes to meet you sooner."

"Should I be concerned?"

"Concerned? No. Prepared? Yes." The old man's voice was measured. "He will have questions. Some of them will be direct, others less so. He will watch how you interact with Tenchi. He will form opinions quickly—it is his nature—but those opinions can change with evidence."

"You make it sound like a job interview."

"In some ways, it is." Katsuhito set down his cup. "You have entered his son's life at a vulnerable time. You have become, in less than a week, a figure of significant attachment. A father would be foolish not to assess such a person carefully."

"I understand."

"Do you?" The old man's gaze was penetrating. "When Kiyone died, Nobuyuki nearly collapsed. He buried himself in work rather than face the emptiness at home. He comes on weekends because he cannot bear to stay away entirely, but the shrine has become a reminder of what he lost as much as a connection to what remains."

"That sounds... difficult."

"It is. For everyone." Katsuhito rose, looking out at the darkness. "But particularly for Tenchi, who loves his father but cannot understand why he leaves each week. Why work matters more than being here."

"Work doesn't matter more. It's easier."

Katsuhito turned back, something like approval in his expression. "You understand this."

"Grief makes people run," Sheldon said. "They think if they keep moving, it can't catch them."

"Yes." The old man's voice softened. "You speak from experience."

"Everyone does, eventually."

They stood together in the evening quiet, two figures on the edge of light and darkness.

"Be patient with him," Katsuhito said finally. "He is a good man beneath the fear. He simply needs time to remember it."

## Scene 4.14: Night - Journal Entry

**Time:** 21:00 - 21:30

The guest room welcomed Sheldon with its familiar shadows, the scroll in the alcove barely visible in the dim light filtering through the shutter.

He lit the small lamp on the desk and opened his journal, smoothing the pages with practiced hands.

*Day 4*, he wrote.

*Worked at the house most of the morning. Found a photo album—the family I supposedly come from, captured in fading images. The woman in the photographs looks kind. I wish I could have known her. Or perhaps I did know her, in some reality that brought me here, and this wanting is just the echo of a memory that was never quite mine.*

*Rea came at noon with lunch. She told me about the facility where she grew up, the woman who saved her from being labeled unreachable. We walked back together and something shifted between us. Not friendship exactly—she guards that word—but recognition. The acknowledgment that we are both people making lives from materials we didn't choose.*

*Tenchi drew me into his family picture. He says family is who you eat dinner with, and we eat dinner together every night. The logic is unassailable. I am, apparently, family now.*

*Nobuyuki comes Saturday. Two days. Everyone in this household carries some version of anxiety about his arrival, though they express it differently. Katsuhito prepares me with stories and warnings. Rea goes silent when his name is mentioned. Tenchi vibrates between excitement and nervousness.*

*I told Tenchi the story of the old man and the fish tonight. He found his own meaning in it, connecting it to his mother's fight. I didn't correct him. Sometimes the meanings children find are more true than the ones we intend.*

He set down the pen, flexing his fingers.

From somewhere in the house came a sound—Tenchi crying out in his sleep, the particular sharp note of a child's nightmare. Then footsteps, soft and quick. Rea's door opening. Tenchi's door closing.

Sheldon waited, listening.

Murmured words he couldn't make out, gentle and soothing. Then silence, the special kind that meant comfort had been given and received.

He returned to his journal.

*Tomorrow: Tanaka returns with materials. The real work begins.*

*Day after tomorrow: Nobuyuki arrives. A different kind of work begins.*

*Tonight: The household sleeps. Rea checks on Tenchi when he dreams badly. The tree watches. I am beginning to understand what it means to belong somewhere.*

He closed the journal and extinguished the lamp.

In the darkness, through the thin walls, he heard Rea's footsteps returning to her room. The house settled around him, all its occupants finding their way toward morning.

Sleep came, eventually, gentle and unresisting.
