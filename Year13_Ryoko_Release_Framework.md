# PART 1: WHAT CANON ESTABLISHES

## 1.1 — Pre-Release Setup

**Canon Facts:**
- Tenchi spending summer vacation at shrine
- Training under grandfather (Yosho/Katsuhito)
- Has been told about "demon in the cave" his whole life
- His mother Kiyone (in OVA) brought him near cave often as child
- Yosho deliberately built up Tenchi's curiosity over years
- Yosho KNOWS Ryoko watches the shrine; this is part of his plan

**What Yosho Wanted:**
1. Tenchi to grow strong enough to handle Ryoko
2. Ryoko to develop bond with Tenchi through observation
3. Ryoko to transform from "Devil of Destruction" to caring person
4. Eventually: heal the damage Kagato caused

## 1.2 — The Release Itself

**Canon Sequence:**
1. Tenchi steals grandfather's keys during training
2. Enters forbidden cave
3. Explores; finds Ryoko's mummified form

5. Cave begins collapsing/changing
6. Tenchi flees; falls unconscious outside

**Canon Details:**
- Ryoko emerges at night while Tenchi unconscious
- Introduces herself
- Glowing yellow eyes reveal "demon" nature
- States: imprisoned 700 years, very angry, wants to take out frustrations

## 1.3 — The Attack

**Canon Facts (from 101 Secrets):**
- Attack was "mere child's play"
- Ryoko could have killed Tenchi + destroyed school "if she wanted"
- She was NOT serious about harming him
- Purpose: "let off some steam" after 700 years of cold, damp confinement
- She felt need for release, not murder

**Weapons/Powers Used:**
- Energy fireballs (explosive)
- Energy sword (from gem on wrist)
- Flight
- Phasing through matter
- Regeneration (when hand cut off, regrows immediately)

## 1.4 — The Resolution

1. Tenchi flees through school
2. Ryoko's rampage ruptures gas pipes
3. Tenchi hides; realizes gem is power source
4. Master Key (Tenchi-ken) activates in satchel
5. Light blade protects Tenchi
6. Cuts off Ryoko's hand (and gem)
7. Gem explodes; Ryoko regenerates hand
8. Ryoko vanishes with grin
9. School explodes from gas
10. Tenchi returns home exhausted
11. Finds Ryoko asleep in his bed

**Key Detail:** Ryoko's SMILE when leaving. Not defeated. Satisfied.

# PART 2: OUR VERSION — MODIFICATIONS

## 2.1 — Pre-Release Context

**Same as Canon:**
- Tenchi's curiosity built over years
- Summer vacation training at shrine
- Yosho's deliberate plan

**Different Due to Sheldon:**
- Tenchi has TWO father figures (Yosho + Sheldon)
- More emotionally stable childhood
- Better prepared for "weird" things
- Has seen Sheldon do inexplicable things (small demonstrations of ability)
- Less isolated; more supported

**Ryoko's Additional Observation:**
- Watched Sheldon arrive (1989)
- Watched him integrate into household
- Watched him become Tenchi's "uncle"
- Watched him cook, laugh, care for family
- 12 years of observing THIS man specifically

## 2.2 — The Release Itself

**UNCHANGED:**
- Tenchi steals keys
- Enters cave
- Breaks seal
- Cave changes
- Tenchi unconscious

**Sheldon's Position:**
- At shrine/house, not present at cave
- Senses something wrong (unease, not cosmic awareness)
- Yosho prevents him from investigating ("Trust my grandson")
- Waits with growing concern

## 2.3 — The Attack

**LARGELY UNCHANGED:**
- Ryoko emerges angry
- Same "playful" attack
- Same school destruction
- Same chase sequence

**Subtle Difference:**
- Tenchi's responses may be slightly different
- More emotionally grounded in crisis
- Still terrified, but doesn't panic same way
- Training with Yosho (same) but also Sheldon's influence

## 2.4 — The Resolution

**UNCHANGED:**
- Tenchi-ken activates
- Ryoko's hand cut off/regenerates
- School explosion
- Ryoko vanishes

**CHANGED — The Return Home:**

Canon: Tenchi returns home, finds Ryoko in his bed.

Our Version: Tenchi returns home → Sheldon is WAITING (awake, concerned) → Brief conversation → Tenchi goes to room → Finds Ryoko in his bed → Ryoko ALSO sees Sheldon in hallway

**The Critical Addition:**

Ryoko's first words to Sheldon (not Tenchi):

> "You're still here."

Three words. Twelve years of watching. Recognition.

---

# PART 3: THE "YOU'RE STILL HERE" MOMENT

## 3.1 — What Those Words Mean

**Surface Level:**
- Acknowledges she's seen him before
- Confirms astral observation capability
- Simple statement of fact

**Deeper Level:**
- She watched a stranger arrive 12 years ago
- Watched him STAY when he didn't have to
- Watched him build family when she was alone
- She's been waiting to see if he'd leave
- He didn't

**Emotional Weight:**
- Ryoko has abandonment issues (created by Washu, used by Kagato)
- She watched someone choose to stay
- That choice matters to her
- Her first words to him acknowledge that choice

## 3.2 — Scene Construction

**Setting:** Hallway of Masaki house, night
**Characters Present:** Sheldon (awake, waiting), Tenchi (exhausted, heading to room), Ryoko (following/appearing)

**Beat by Beat:**

1. **SHELDON** stands in hallway, clearly hasn't slept
2. **TENCHI** enters, exhausted, clothes torn/dirty
3. Brief exchange — Tenchi says "I'm okay" or similar
4. Tenchi heads to his room
5. **RYOKO** appears (phasing through wall? already in hall?)
6. Sheldon sees her
7. Ryoko sees Sheldon
8. Beat of recognition
9. **RYOKO:** "You're still here."
10. **SHELDON:** [Response TBD]
11. Ryoko goes to Tenchi's room (as in canon)

## 3.3 — Sheldon's Response Options

**Option A — Simple Acknowledgment:**
> "I am."

Mirrors her simplicity. Confirms the fact. No demands, no questions.

**Option B — Gentle Challenge:**
> "Where else would I be?"

Implies: staying is natural, not remarkable. Challenges her surprise.

**Option C — Recognition Back:**
> "You've been watching."

Shows he knew (or suspected) she was aware. Levels playing field.

**Option D — Warmth:**
> "Welcome home."

Bold. Assumes she belongs. Offers what she's been watching from outside.

**RECOMMENDED:** Option A or D, depending on tone desired.

- Option A: More mysterious, lets Ryoko control the conversation
- Option D: More vulnerable, Sheldon takes the initiative

# PART 4: CASCADE FROM THIS SCENE

## 4.1 — Immediate Effects

**On Ryoko:**
- Her usual "playful chaos" mode is disrupted
- She expected to meet Tenchi alone
- Sheldon's presence changes the dynamic
- She can't pretend she doesn't know him

**On Sheldon:**
- Now aware the "demon" is real
- Saw her with Tenchi
- Must process: sealed entity, 700 years, watching his family
- His "uncle" role now extends to whatever this is

**On Tenchi:**
- Discovers Ryoko in bed (same as canon)
- But knows Sheldon saw her too
- Not alone in dealing with this

## 4.2 — Morning After

**Canon:** Ryoko wakes up in Tenchi's bed, chaos ensues
**Our Version:** Same chaos, but Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast

**Key Change:** Ryoko can't dominate the household dynamic because Sheldon is already there, already established, already cooking.

She has to fit INTO the family structure, not CREATE chaos around Tenchi.

## 4.3 — First Real Conversation (Ryoko-Sheldon)

**Should Occur:** Day 2 or 3 after release

**Setting:** Kitchen, probably. Sheldon cooking.

**Purpose:** Establish their dynamic
- Ryoko is aggressive/flirtatious/chaotic
- Sheldon is calm/warm/unflappable
- He treats her like... family. Already.
- This confuses her

**Potential Dialogue Elements:**
- Ryoko tries to intimidate/seduce
- Sheldon offers food instead
- Ryoko doesn't know how to respond to genuine care
- She watched this for years; experiencing it is different
