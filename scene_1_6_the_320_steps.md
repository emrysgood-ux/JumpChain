## SCENE 1.6: THE 320 STEPS

**April 3, 1989 — ~17:30 JST**
**Location:** Masaki Shrine approach
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The first hundred steps were manageable.

Stone worn smooth by centuries of feet, each one slightly different from the last—some tilted, some cracked, some settled into the mountain at angles that required attention. The forest pressed close on either side, bamboo and cedar filtering the fading sunlight into shifting patterns on the path ahead. Sheldon climbed with the methodical pace of someone who knew better than to rush, his body already running on reserves he hadn't known he possessed.

The cloth bag from Haruna's store hung from his left hand, swinging gently with each step. Candles, matches, rice, soap. The supplies for a life he was still learning how to live.

The second hundred steps were harder.

The path curved here, switchbacking up the steeper portion of the mountainside, and Sheldon felt the accumulated weight of the day pressing down on him with each elevation gained. His legs burned. His lungs worked harder than they should have for what amounted to a moderate climb. Whatever reserves his body had drawn upon during the walk from the field were running low now, the account overdrawn and demanding payment.

*Haruna said there was a side path*, he remembered. *Two hundred steps to the residence instead of three hundred twenty to the top.*

He found it at the next landing—a narrower trail branching off to the right, marked by a small wooden sign with characters too weathered to read in the failing light. Sheldon took it without hesitation. Pride could wait. Survival couldn't.

The side path wound through older growth, trees that had been standing when his grandparents—his constructed grandparents, his given grandparents—had been young. The air was cooler here, touched with the particular dampness of mountain forest, and somewhere above him he could hear water moving. A stream, maybe, or a spring feeding down toward the lake he'd glimpsed from the Tsukino garden.

Eighty more steps. Sixty. Forty.

The trees thinned.

---

The shrine grounds opened before him like something from a different century.

Traditional buildings with dark wooden walls and curved roofs, arranged around a central courtyard swept clean of leaves and debris. Stone lanterns lined the paths, unlit but waiting. A massive tree dominated one corner of the grounds—ancient, impossibly ancient, its trunk wider than any tree Sheldon had ever seen, its branches spreading in a canopy that seemed to catch the last light of day and hold it. Something about that tree drew the eye and held it, demanded attention in a way that felt almost physical.

*Sacred*, Sheldon thought, though he didn't know where the word came from. *That tree is sacred to this place.*

A stone water basin stood near the entrance to the main courtyard—a chōzuya, the purification fountain found at every shrine. Water flowed into it from a bamboo spout, the sound gentle and constant, the kind of white noise that had probably been playing here since before anyone alive could remember.

The courtyard itself was empty. Peaceful. The light was amber now, the sun dropping behind the western peaks, and long shadows stretched across the swept stone like fingers reaching for the buildings.

Sheldon stood at the edge of the space, uncertain how to proceed. This was a shrine—a religious site, not a hotel. You didn't just walk in and ask for a room. There were protocols, courtesies, ways of doing things that his years in Kyoto had taught him to respect even if he didn't fully understand them.

But Haruna had said the priest took in travelers. And Sheldon was, at this moment, very much a traveler in need of taking in.

"You climbed all the way up."

The voice came from his left, calm and unhurried, carrying the particular quality of someone who had seen enough in life to be surprised by very little. Sheldon turned.

The old man stood perhaps ten meters away, near one of the smaller buildings, a bamboo broom resting against his shoulder. White hair, thin but not sparse, pulled back in a simple tie. A face weathered by decades of sun and wind, deep lines carved around eyes that were sharper than their setting suggested. He wore the simple robes of a Shinto priest—white kosode, light blue hakama—and stood with the easy posture of someone completely at home in his own body despite his apparent age.

Katsuhito. It had to be.

"Masaki-san?" Sheldon managed, his voice rougher than he'd expected. The climb had taken more out of him than he'd realized.

"Just Katsuhito is fine. 'Masaki-san' makes me sound like my father." The old priest's lips curved slightly—not quite a smile, but something related to it. "You're the one they've been talking about. The Tsukino heir from America."

The village information network. Of course.

"Tsukino Sheldon." He bowed—deeper than he had for Yamamoto, deeper than social convention strictly required, because something about this place demanded respect. "I apologize for arriving unannounced. Haruna-san said you sometimes offer hospitality to travelers, and I—"

"Your house isn't habitable yet." Katsuhito said it as simple fact, not question. "No power. Roof needs work. The pump works, but that's about all." He studied Sheldon with an expression that was impossible to read—assessment, certainly, but of what kind Sheldon couldn't tell. "You look like you've had a long journey."

"Longer than I expected."

Something flickered behind the old priest's eyes. Recognition of some kind, though what he was recognizing Sheldon couldn't guess.

"Come," Katsuhito said, turning toward the largest of the residential buildings. "You can wash the road off your feet and have tea while we talk. The bath won't be ready until after dinner, but the water basin in the hall should serve for now."

"I don't want to impose—"

"You're not imposing." The correction was gentle but firm. "You're accepting hospitality. There's a difference. On this mountain, we don't send strangers away at dusk with nowhere to go. That's not how things are done."

Sheldon opened his mouth to protest further, then closed it. The old man was right. He had nowhere else to go. He was exhausted, hungry, running on nothing but water from Haruna's shop and determination. And refusing genuine hospitality—hospitality offered without apparent strings—would be foolish at best, insulting at worst.

"Thank you," he said. "I'm grateful."

"Good." Katsuhito picked up his broom, considered it for a moment, then set it aside against the building wall. "The sweeping can wait until morning. It always does."

---

The interior of the residence was dim and cool, the last light of day filtering through paper screens to cast everything in soft amber. Sheldon removed his shoes at the genkan, stepping up onto the raised wooden floor in his socks, following Katsuhito through a narrow hallway toward what looked like a main living area.

The house smelled of wood and incense and something cooking—rice, maybe, and vegetables, the ordinary aromatics of a household preparing an evening meal. Somewhere deeper in the building, Sheldon could hear movement—the soft clatter of dishes, the slide of a cabinet door. Through a gap in one of the paper screens, he caught a glimpse of someone in the kitchen: a girl, young, maybe fifteen or sixteen, her dark hair pulled back as she stirred something on the stove. She didn't look up as they passed.

"The basin is there." Katsuhito gestured toward a small alcove where a ceramic bowl sat on a wooden stand, a folded towel beside it. "I'll bring tea. Rea is preparing dinner—there will be enough for one more."

He disappeared through a sliding door, leaving Sheldon alone in the hallway.

The water in the basin was cool and clean, and Sheldon washed his hands and face with the particular gratitude of someone who had been dirty for longer than he'd realized. The towel was soft, worn smooth by countless washings, and smelled faintly of sun and cedar. Simple things. Ordinary things. The kind of details that grounded a person in the reality of being alive.

He was drying his face when he heard the footsteps.

Small footsteps. Quick and light, the unmistakable rhythm of a child in motion.

Sheldon turned.

The boy stood at the end of the hallway, frozen in the particular way of children who had come to investigate something and found more than they expected. He was small—very small, the compact size of early childhood, maybe a hundred centimeters tall. Black hair cut in a simple bowl shape, sticking up slightly in the back. Dark eyes, wide and curious, fixed on Sheldon with an intensity that adults learned to disguise but children never bothered hiding.

Four years old. Almost five.

*Tenchi*, Sheldon's mind supplied. *The grandson. Lost his mother last year.*

For a long moment, neither of them moved. The boy stared at Sheldon with the frank assessment of someone who hadn't yet learned that staring was impolite. Sheldon stared back, uncertain what to do, how to act, what expression would be appropriate for meeting a child in someone else's home at the end of an impossible day.

"Your face is different," the boy said finally.

Sheldon blinked. "Different?"

"Different from other people's faces. It's darker." The observation was matter-of-fact, carrying no judgment—just a child noting something he hadn't seen before and trying to understand it. "Why?"

Before Sheldon could formulate a response, Katsuhito's voice came from somewhere behind the boy. "Tenchi." Gentle correction, not rebuke.

The boy—Tenchi—turned his head slightly but didn't take his eyes off Sheldon. "I'm not being rude, Ojii-chan. I'm asking a question. You said asking questions is how we learn things."

"That's true." Katsuhito appeared in the hallway, a tea tray in his hands, his expression carrying something that might have been amusement. "But some questions are better asked with context. This is Tsukino Sheldon. He's come from America—that's a country far away, across the ocean. Many people there have skin like his."

Tenchi considered this information with the seriousness of a scholar evaluating new data. "Is America where Mommy went?"

The question hung in the air. Sheldon saw something flicker across Katsuhito's face—grief, carefully controlled, never fully absent.

"No," the old priest said quietly. "Mommy went somewhere else. Somewhere we can't visit yet."

Tenchi nodded, accepting this as he apparently accepted most things—completely, without the doubt that came with age. Then his attention returned to Sheldon, the previous topic already processing in whatever way children processed information they didn't fully understand.

"Are you staying for dinner?"

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, uncertain of the answer.

"He's staying for dinner," Katsuhito confirmed. "And tonight, and perhaps longer. He's going to sleep in the room with the squeaky door."

"The guest room!" Tenchi's face transformed, grief forgotten in the immediate excitement of new information. "That's Daddy's old room. He keeps his baseball cards in the closet. Don't touch them—he gets upset."

"I won't touch them," Sheldon promised.

"Good." Tenchi studied him for another moment, then apparently reached some internal decision. "I'm Tenchi. I'm four, but I'm going to be five soon. Ojii-chan says I can have mochi for my birthday if I'm good until then."

"That sounds like a good deal."

"It is." Tenchi nodded gravely. "I'm being very good."

Katsuhito set the tea tray on a low table in the room beyond the hallway, his movements economical and practiced. "Tenchi, go wash your hands for dinner. You can talk to Tsukino-san more afterward."

"Okay." Tenchi looked at Sheldon one more time, his expression unreadable in the way children's expressions often were—too much happening behind those eyes to track. "I'm glad you're staying. Ojii-chan only has me and Rea-neechan to talk to, and I don't know very many words yet."

He turned and padded down the hallway, his small feet making almost no sound on the wooden floor. A moment later, Sheldon heard water running somewhere deeper in the house.

Katsuhito gestured toward the table. "Sit. The tea will help."

---

The tea was hot and bitter and exactly what Sheldon needed. He sat across from Katsuhito in the traditional style—seiza, knees folded beneath him—and let the warmth spread through his chest while the old priest watched him with those sharp, unreadable eyes.

"The Tsukino house," Katsuhito said after a long silence. "You've seen it?"

"This afternoon. After Yamamoto-san dropped me at the turn."

"And?"

Sheldon considered the question, the many ways he could answer it. "It needs work. The roof, especially. But the structure is sound. The pump works—the water runs clear. And there are futons in the closet, though Haruna-san says they'll need airing."

"Haruna would know. She knows everything that happens on this mountain." Katsuhito's lips curved again—that almost-smile that seemed to be his default expression. "She called ahead. Warned me you might be coming this way."

"The village information network."

"Faster than any telephone." Katsuhito poured more tea, the gesture smooth and practiced. "Your grandmother was Tsukino Hana. I knew her, when I was younger. A strong woman. She helped many people in this village, including my own family."

"Yamamoto-san said something similar."

"He would. The Yamamotos have long memories." Katsuhito set down the teapot, his hands folding in his lap with the stillness of someone who had learned patience over more years than most people could imagine. "You've come a long way to claim a house that needs repairs and a name that most people here have nearly forgotten. Why?"

It was the first direct question anyone had asked him. Not *are you okay* or *what do you need*, but *why*. The question beneath all the others.

Sheldon thought about his answer. The true answer—*I died, and something brought me back, and this is where it put me*—was impossible. The constructed answer—*my mother's family, my inheritance, my roots*—was technically accurate but felt hollow. What came out was something in between.

"I needed somewhere to belong," he said. "Somewhere that was mine, not borrowed or temporary or contingent on someone else's approval. My mother talked about this place when I was young. She never came back, but I think she always meant to." The lies blended with whatever truth he could find, creating something that felt almost honest. "I'm here because she couldn't be. To see what she left behind. To decide if I can make it mine."

Katsuhito studied him for a long moment. The silence stretched, comfortable rather than awkward, the kind of quiet that happened between people who didn't need to fill every moment with words.

"The house will take time," the old priest said finally. "Weeks before it's truly livable. Months before it feels like home. You can stay here while the work is being done. The guest room isn't much—the door squeaks, as Tenchi mentioned, and the futon is older than he is—but it doesn't leak, and you'll have meals and a bath and company if you want it."

"That's generous."

"It's practical." Katsuhito's eyes held something Sheldon couldn't identify—assessment, certainly, but also something else. Interest, maybe. The look of someone who had seen something unexpected and was trying to understand what it meant. "Tenchi needs more adults in his life. His father works in the city—comes back on weekends when he can, but that's not enough. I do my best, but I'm old, and children need more than one person to raise them properly."

"I'm not sure I'd be much help with children."

"You'd be surprised." Katsuhito rose, the movement fluid despite his apparent age. "Dinner will be ready soon. I'll show you the room—you can leave your things there, rest if you need to. We eat simply here, but there's always enough."

Sheldon stood, his legs protesting the transition from seiza. "Thank you. For all of this. I know it's more than I have any right to expect."

Katsuhito paused at the door, looking back with an expression that might have been amusement or might have been something else entirely.

"On this mountain," he said, "we take care of each other. That's how it's always been. That's how it will continue to be, as long as I have anything to say about it."

He slid the door open and gestured for Sheldon to follow. Somewhere deeper in the house, Tenchi's voice was singing something—off-key but enthusiastic, the kind of noise that only children made.

Sheldon picked up his bag of supplies and followed the old priest into the dimness of the hallway. Behind him, through the paper screens, the last light of day was fading to purple and gold.

His first day in this new life was almost over.

He had survived it.
