# Son of Cosmos Day 1 Scene Inventory: Complete Documentation

This exhaustive search of Google Drive documents reveals **extensive existing materials** for Day 1 (April 3, 1989) across multiple document versions, scene drafts, and reference files.

| Myopia | **GONE** — perfect vision |

---

## 4. System contact / "The presence" scenes

**Found in SCENE_1_13_FIRST_NIGHT_SLEEP.md:**

Dream sequence featuring white figure (reader knows = Cosmos; Sheldon does NOT):
> "Someone was standing at the edge of his vision. A figure in white, tall and slender, their features unclear in the bright light. They were watching him."
> "Something in the way they stood—patient, gentle, infinitely sad—made him feel that they knew him. Knew everything about him. Had always known."

**Funaho Tree awareness** (mountain presence):
> "Outside the window, the mountain watched him sleep. The great tree's branches moved slightly in the night breeze—or perhaps not in the breeze at all. Perhaps in response to something else."

---

## 5. 1989 Realization scenes

**From awakening scenes** — Sheldon realizes displacement through:
- Japanese documents and currency
- Environmental cues (not Alaska)
- Watch showing 2:47 PM (different timezone)
- Unfamiliar bird calls (uguisu)
- Japanese rural landscape

**Note:** Exact year realization (1989 vs 2025) occurs through date on documents — explicitly covered in inventory discovery.

## Gaps Identified

1. **Bath scene:** No dedicated scene file found; may need extraction from CHAPTERS documents or creation
2. **THE_AWAKENING_FIELD_v1.docx:** No document with this exact filename found in Drive; content may be distributed across field_awakening.md and awakening scenes
3. **Alternate versions from earlier conversations:** Referenced as "superseded" in MAPVS headers but not individually preserved as documents
