## SCENE 1: WAKING IN THE SHRINE
**Time:** 05:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The uguisu sang from somewhere closer.

Different trees, different acoustics, the same three-note call that had marked his mornings since arriving on this mountain. *Ho-hokekyo*. The Japanese bush warbler announcing dawn to an audience that had shifted by two hundred meters overnight.

He lay still for a moment, reorienting. Guest room. Shrine residence. Six-week minimum stay. The facts assembled themselves into a framework his waking mind could navigate.

The futon here was slightly thicker than the one at the Tsukino house—better padding, newer cotton, the difference between furniture stored for decades and furniture actually used. His body had noticed the change during the night, finding positions it hadn't needed to find on harder bedding.

*Small mercies*, Dorothy Mae would have said. *A comfortable bed makes the rest easier to bear.*

He rose, folded the futon with motions that were becoming automatic, and dressed in work clothes that still smelled faintly of yesterday's rain.

---

## SCENE 2: MORNING SOUNDS
**Time:** 05:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, hallway

The shrine residence carried different sounds than the Tsukino house.

Running water from somewhere—Katsuhito in the kitchen, perhaps, or the outdoor pump that fed the bathhouse. Footsteps on tatami, lighter than an adult's: Tenchi awake early, moving through the house with the contained energy of a child who'd learned not to run indoors.

Wood settling. Wind through eaves. The particular creak of a floorboard near the entrance that Sheldon had already learned to avoid.

He made his way toward the kitchen, navigating by sound and the pre-dawn gray filtering through shoji screens. The hallway connected the guest quarters to the main living areas, a passage he would walk hundreds of times over the coming weeks.

"Good morning." Katsuhito's voice came from the kitchen before Sheldon reached it. "Tea is ready."

---

## SCENE 3: EARLY TEA
**Time:** 05:52:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The kitchen held warmth from the stove.

Katsuhito stood at the counter, pouring tea from a ceramic pot into two cups. His movements carried the efficiency of long practice—no wasted motion, no hesitation, every gesture the product of repetition over decades.

"You're awake early," he observed.

"Habit." Sheldon accepted the offered cup. "My body doesn't seem to need as much sleep as it used to."

"Another gift from your benefactor?"

The question was casual, but Sheldon heard the precision beneath it. Katsuhito had noticed the physical changes—the absent fatigue, the rapid healing, the stamina that exceeded normal parameters.

"Possibly. I'm still cataloging what's different."

"A wise approach." The priest sipped his tea. "Gifts should be understood before they're relied upon."

---

## SCENE 4: BREAKFAST PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Tenchi appeared as breakfast preparation began.

Still in sleeping clothes, hair disheveled from bed, eyes carrying the particular brightness of a child who'd been awake for longer than his appearance suggested. He'd been waiting, Sheldon realized—listening for sounds of adult activity before emerging.

"Good morning, Tenchi."

"Good morning!" The boy positioned himself at the kitchen table, watching Katsuhito's movements with the attention of someone cataloging data. "Grandfather, can Sheldon-san help cook today?"

"Sheldon-san will be working at his house today."

"Before that. He helped yesterday."

Katsuhito glanced at Sheldon with something approaching amusement. "Would you like to help?"

"If I won't be in the way."

"You were not in the way yesterday. Today should be no different." He gestured toward the basket of vegetables. "Continue your education."

---

## SCENE 5: KNIFE WORK
**Time:** 06:42:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The knife felt more natural today.

Not comfortable—single-beveled Japanese knives required technique his hands didn't instinctively possess—but the relationship between blade and ingredient had shifted. Yesterday's cuts had been experiments. Today's cuts were repetitions of experiments that had partially succeeded.

"Thinner," Katsuhito observed, watching his work on the daikon. "For miso soup, the pieces should be thin enough to cook quickly but thick enough to hold their shape."

Adjustments. The blade bit into white flesh at a shallower angle. Translucent coins emerged, not quite uniform but approaching consistency.

"Better." The priest's approval was spare but genuine. "You remember what your body learns."

Tenchi watched from his position at the table, attention moving between Sheldon's hands and the results they produced. "Can I try?"

"When you're older," Katsuhito said. "Knives require patience. Patience requires years."

"How many years?"

"As many as it takes."

The answer satisfied neither boy nor adult observer, but Tenchi accepted it with the resignation of someone who'd heard similar responses to similar questions throughout his short life.

---

## SCENE 6: THE MEAL
**Time:** 07:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Saturday breakfast differed from weekday patterns.

No school for Tenchi, which meant no bus to catch, which meant the meal could unfold at a pace the weekdays didn't permit. Katsuhito served rice, miso soup with Sheldon's vegetables, pickled plums, a small portion of grilled fish. The quantities were modest but sufficient.

"Today's work," the priest said between bites. "Yamada will continue exposing the roof structure. You'll assist?"

"He expects me at seven. Earlier, actually—he said preparation begins before labor."

"A traditional view. Yamada learned carpentry when masters still demanded perfection before breakfast." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "Listen to everything he tells you. Not just the instructions—the philosophy behind them."

"Why?"

"Because the philosophy will remain useful long after the roof is repaired."

---

## SCENE 7: WALK TO THE WORK SITE
**Time:** 07:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Shrine and Tsukino House

The morning air carried yesterday's rain in scent if not in substance.

Wet earth, cedar after soaking, the particular freshness that followed precipitation in mountain regions. Sheldon walked the path he'd memorized over six days—stream crossing, cherry trees now mostly green, the gradual descent from shrine elevation to village level.

The Tsukino house appeared through breaks in the foliage, blue tarps visible on the roof where yesterday's work had been protected from weather. From this angle, the damage wasn't visible—just a traditional Japanese home, waiting.

*Not waiting*, he corrected himself. *Being repaired. Actively, now, not just enduring.*

The distinction mattered. Etsuko's house had waited for decades, deteriorating slowly, damage accumulating beneath surfaces that appeared sound. Now the waiting was over. What had been hidden would be exposed, assessed, corrected.

Yamada and Takeshi were already at work when Sheldon arrived.

---

## SCENE 8: MORNING BRIEFING
**Time:** 08:05:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

"Today we expose the full extent," Yamada said.

He stood at the base of the ladder, addressing Sheldon and Takeshi with the formality of someone beginning a serious undertaking. Behind him, the tarps they'd installed yesterday rippled slightly in the morning breeze.

"The tiles from the damaged section are removed. Now we remove the underlayment—the clay, the bark, the felt. We examine every rafter, every joint, every connection point. We document what we find."

"How do we document?" Sheldon asked.

"I watch. Takeshi measures. You sketch." Yamada produced a small notebook and pencil from his tool bag. "Can you draw?"

"Basic diagrams. Nothing artistic."

"Diagrams are sufficient. Draw what you see. Mark what I tell you to mark." He handed over the materials. "Today you learn what your house has become. Tomorrow we begin deciding what it will be."

---

## SCENE 9: THE UNDERLAYMENT
**Time:** 08:45:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

Removing the underlayment was slower than removing tiles.

The *tsuchi-buki* method used a thick layer of clay mixed with straw, pressed over cedar bark strips, creating a cushioned bed for the tiles above. Where the clay remained intact, it held together in heavy sections that required careful prying. Where water had degraded it, it crumbled into dust and fragments that fell through gaps in the sheathing below.

"Here." Yamada pointed to a section where the clay had turned black. "See the color change?"

Sheldon leaned closer. The black wasn't uniform—it radiated from a central point, spreading outward in patterns that resembled tree roots or river deltas.

"Water paths," Yamada explained. "The initial entry point, and everywhere the moisture traveled over years of infiltration. The black is mold—not dangerous in open air, but evidence of conditions termites find attractive."

"How long ago did this start?"

"Difficult to say. Ten years, perhaps. Perhaps longer." The carpenter's voice carried no judgment, only assessment. "Water is patient. It finds paths humans can't imagine."

---

## SCENE 10: THE TERMITE EVIDENCE
**Time:** 09:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

The termites had left signatures.

Not the insects themselves—those had retreated when their habitat was disturbed—but the trails they'd carved through wood that should have been solid. Yamada showed Sheldon how to read the evidence: mud tubes along rafter surfaces, galleries hidden within grain patterns, the particular texture of wood that had been hollowed from within.

"*Ie-shiroari*," Yamada said, pointing to a mud tube that ran vertically along a corner post. "Formosan termites. They carry water with them, which means they can damage wood far from the ground."

"How far did they spread?"

"That's what we're determining." He tapped a rafter with his awl, listened to the sound. Solid. Moved six inches, tapped again. Hollow. "Draw this. Solid here—" pointing, "—hollow here. The boundary matters."

Sheldon sketched rapidly, marking the transition point Yamada had identified. The notebook was filling with diagrams that would mean nothing to an outside observer but represented the accumulated knowledge of a morning's investigation.

"Every boundary like this is a decision point," Yamada continued. "Do we cut out the damaged section and splice in new wood? Do we sister a new member alongside the old? Do we replace entirely?" He met Sheldon's eyes. "The answers depend on understanding the full picture."

---

## SCENE 11: LUNCH BREAK
**Time:** 12:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

They ate on the engawa, looking at the house from outside.

Rice balls Sheldon had made that morning. Pickled vegetables Katsuhito had provided. Tea from a thermos Takeshi had brought. The meal was functional rather than ceremonial—fuel for bodies that had been working since dawn.

"The damage is extensive," Yamada said, reviewing the morning's findings. "More extensive than yesterday suggested."

"How bad?"

"Six rafters require replacement. Three more need reinforcement. The ridge beam—" He paused, choosing words. "The ridge beam is compromised at both end joints. The wood is sound between the joints, but the connections have failed."

"What does that mean for the timeline?"

"Eight weeks minimum. Possibly ten." Yamada's voice remained level, but his expression carried weight. "The materials cost will increase. The labor—Takeshi and I can handle most of it, but we'll need a third worker for the ridge beam replacement. That coordination takes time."

Sheldon absorbed the information. Ten weeks. Two and a half months. The summer would be half over before he could return to his house.

"Is the structure safe to continue working on?"

"Yes. Now that we understand the damage, we can shore properly. The danger came from not knowing—from assuming soundness where soundness didn't exist." Yamada finished his rice ball, brushed crumbs from his hands. "We return to work in fifteen minutes."

---

## SCENE 12: AFTERNOON LABOR
**Time:** 14:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

The afternoon brought physical labor.

Sheldon helped remove compromised sections of sheathing—the boards beneath the underlayment that provided the roof's base structure. Some pieces came away in intact planks. Others crumbled, the wood so degraded that it tore rather than separated.

"Save the solid sections," Yamada instructed. "Good cypress, this. Eighty years old, at least. We can reuse what hasn't failed."

The work required strength but also precision. Pry bars inserted at specific angles. Pressure applied gradually, not suddenly. Listening for sounds that indicated stress or resistance. The process felt almost surgical—removing damaged tissue while preserving what could be saved.

By mid-afternoon, half the damaged section had been exposed. Rafters stood bare, their condition visible for the first time since the house was built. Some showed the dark staining of water damage. Others showed the galleries and tubes of termite passage. A few—fewer than Sheldon had feared—remained sound, the wood solid and stable despite decades of hidden assault nearby.

"The grandfather knew his work," Yamada observed, examining one of the sound rafters. "Good joints. Proper spacing. If the tiles hadn't failed, this house might have lasted another fifty years without intervention."

"What made the tiles fail?"

"Time. Movement. Perhaps an impact—a branch falling during a storm. Perhaps simple wear." He ran his hand along the rafter's surface. "Houses require maintenance. Without it, small problems become large ones. That's true everywhere, but especially true for traditional construction."

---

## SCENE 13: END OF DAY
**Time:** 17:00:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Yamada called the work early.

"Enough for today. We've exposed what we needed to expose. Tomorrow—" He stopped, remembering. "Tomorrow is Sunday. We don't work Sunday."

"I could continue alone—"

"No." The word carried finality. "This work requires supervision. The structure is stable but not safe for unsupervised activity." His expression softened slightly. "Rest. Let your body recover. The house will still need repair on Monday."

They covered the exposed sections with additional tarps, securing the edges against wind that might rise overnight. Takeshi gathered tools into organized bundles. Yamada made final notes in his own notebook—observations Sheldon couldn't read but understood to be important.

"Monday, seven o'clock," the carpenter said as they prepared to leave. "We begin replacing members. The work becomes more complicated."

"I'll be ready."

"I know you will." Something approaching approval crossed his weathered face. "You work well, for a man who has never worked with his hands before."

"I worked with my hands. Just not on houses."

"On what, then?"

Sheldon considered the question. His previous life—the physicist's life, the researcher's life—had involved hands constantly. Adjusting equipment. Calibrating instruments. Writing equations on whiteboards that required physical motion to produce.

"Machines," he said finally. "Different kinds of machines."

Yamada nodded as if this explained something he'd been wondering about. "Machines and houses are not so different. Both require understanding before they can be fixed."

---

## SCENE 14: RETURN TO THE SHRINE
**Time:** 17:45:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Shrine

The walk back felt longer than the walk there.

Not distance—the path remained the same 850 meters it had been that morning—but weight. His body carried the day's labor in muscles that didn't normally perform such work. His mind carried the day's information in patterns that were still organizing themselves into coherent understanding.

Eight to ten weeks. Six rafters replaced, three reinforced, ridge beam connections rebuilt. The scope of work had expanded again, the timeline stretching toward summer's end.

*At least you have somewhere to stay*, Dorothy Mae's voice observed. *Imagine doing this alone.*

He couldn't, actually. The logistics of repairing a house while living elsewhere, in a community where he knew no one, in a country whose systems he didn't understand—the complexity would have been overwhelming. Katsuhito's hospitality wasn't just kindness. It was infrastructure.

The shrine's torii gate appeared through the trees. Three hundred twenty steps remained between the path and the residence.

He began to climb.

---

## SCENE 15: TENCHI'S GREETING
**Time:** 18:05:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"Sheldon-san!"

Tenchi waited on the engawa, still dressed in day clothes, vibrating with the contained energy of a child who'd been patient for hours and was running low on patience reserves.

"You were gone all day! Grandfather said you were fixing the house but you weren't allowed to take me because of dangerous and sharp things."

"That's accurate." Sheldon settled onto the engawa, removing his work boots. His muscles appreciated the chance to stop moving. "The house had a lot of problems we didn't know about."

"Grandfather said termites. Are termites really bugs that eat houses?"

"They eat wood. Houses are made of wood, so—yes."

"Did you see them?"

"I saw where they'd been. The paths they carved through the wood." Sheldon considered how to explain termite galleries to a four-year-old. "Imagine if you could eat through a piece of candy, leaving tunnels behind. That's what termites do to wood."

Tenchi's eyes widened with fascinated horror. "That would take a long time."

"Years. Decades, for a whole house."

"Are they still eating it?"

"We disturbed them. They've probably left to find somewhere quieter." Sheldon hoped this was true. Yamada hadn't mentioned active infestation, only evidence of past activity. "We'll treat the wood so they can't come back."

"How?"

"Chemicals. Special treatments that make the wood taste bad to termites."

The explanation satisfied something in the boy's need to understand. He nodded with the seriousness of someone who'd received important information and was filing it for future reference.

"Dinner is almost ready," he reported. "Grandfather made fish."

---

## SCENE 16: SATURDAY DINNER
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

The meal carried Saturday's relaxed rhythm.

No school tomorrow, no early departure, no need to compress eating into efficient intervals. Katsuhito served grilled mackerel, rice, miso soup with vegetables Sheldon now recognized as his morning's work, pickled daikon. The portions were generous—working labor apparently warranted additional fuel.

"The house?" the priest asked.

"Worse than yesterday's estimate. Eight to ten weeks now."

"Ah." The syllable contained acceptance rather than surprise. "Houses reveal their secrets slowly."

"Yamada said the same thing. More or less."

"He would. He's been saying it for fifty years." Katsuhito served rice into Tenchi's bowl. "What did you learn today?"

Sheldon considered the question. The facts were clear: termite damage, water infiltration, structural compromise. But Katsuhito was asking about something beyond facts.

"That damage spreads in patterns. That water finds paths humans can't predict. That old builders knew things we've forgotten." He paused. "That houses require attention, and without it, small failures become large ones."

"Those are good lessons. They apply beyond houses."

"Most things do, in my experience."

The priest's smile suggested approval of the response, or perhaps recognition of a perspective he shared.

---

## SCENE 17: BATH TIME
**Time:** 19:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

The bath was different at the shrine.

Not the basic mechanics—wash outside the tub, soak inside, don't contaminate the shared water—but the context. The Tsukino house had a small, efficient bathroom, adequate for a single occupant. The shrine's facility served a household, with space proportioned accordingly.

Sheldon washed thoroughly, removing the day's accumulation of dust and sweat and the particular grime that came from handling materials that had been sealed for decades. The water ran gray before it ran clear.

The soaking tub was larger than the one at his house. Deep enough that the water reached his chest when seated, hot enough that the temperature required gradual entry. He lowered himself by stages, letting muscles that had worked all day release their accumulated tension.

*This is why people live in communities*, he thought. *Resources shared. Burdens distributed. No one has to heat their own bath after working alone all day.*

The insight felt obvious in retrospect. His American upbringing had emphasized independence—the single-family home, the individual achievement, the self-made success. But traditional Japanese village life operated on different assumptions. Shared resources. Mutual obligation. The bath he was soaking in was possible because generations of shrine residents had maintained the infrastructure that heated it.

He let himself drift, the water's heat drawing out fatigue he hadn't fully registered.

---

## SCENE 18: EVENING QUIET
**Time:** 20:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Tenchi had been put to bed.

The evening had cooled enough that Sheldon found himself grateful for the light jacket he'd grabbed before stepping onto the engawa. Stars were emerging through the deepening blue—more stars than he'd ever seen in Fairbanks, though he'd thought Alaska skies were dark.

Katsuhito joined him after a few minutes, settling into his customary position with a cup of tea. The routine was establishing itself: evening quiet on the engawa, conversation optional, presence sufficient.

"You're adapting well," the priest observed.

"Am I?"

"To the household. To the work. To circumstances you didn't choose." He sipped his tea. "Many people struggle with adaptation. You seem to find it... natural."

"I don't have alternatives. Adaptation or failure."

"Everyone has alternatives. You could have refused Yamada's assessment and insisted on staying in your house. You could have sought accommodation in the town rather than accepting my invitation. You could have hired contractors and supervised from a distance." Katsuhito's voice remained mild, observational. "You chose immersion. That's not lack of alternatives—it's preference."

Sheldon considered the observation. Had he chosen, really? Or had circumstance channeled him toward the only viable path?

"I don't know what I'm doing," he admitted. "Most of the time, I'm making decisions without understanding their implications."

"That's true of everyone. The difference is whether you make decisions anyway, or wait for understanding that may never come."

---

## SCENE 19: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** ~23:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The white figure was absent tonight.

Instead, he dreamed of the Tsukino house—not as it was, damaged and exposed, but as it might have been decades ago. Solid rafters, intact tiles, walls that held their shape without sagging. A woman who might have been Etsuko moved through rooms that no longer existed in their original form.

*You'll fix it*, she said, or didn't say. *You'll make it better than I could.*

*I don't know how.*

*You're learning. That's enough.*

He woke with the sense of having received permission, though he couldn't have explained permission for what.
