## SCENE 1.7: FIRST DINNER

**April 3, 1989 — ~18:30 JST**
**Location:** Masaki Shrine residence
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The dining room was small and traditional—tatami mats, a low table that had been polished by years of use, sliding doors that opened onto the engawa and the darkening garden beyond. Four cushions had been arranged around the table, and the girl from the kitchen was setting out dishes with the practiced efficiency of someone who had done this hundreds of times before.

She looked up when Sheldon entered behind Katsuhito, and for a moment their eyes met.

Fifteen, maybe sixteen. Dark hair pulled back in a simple ponytail, a few strands escaping to frame a face that was carefully neutral. She wore a plain blue apron over a white blouse and dark skirt—practical clothes, the kind worn by someone who expected to work rather than be observed. Her hands paused in their motion, a serving bowl suspended between table and tray, and she studied Sheldon with an expression that gave nothing away.

"Rea," Katsuhito said, his voice carrying the easy warmth of family, "this is Tsukino Sheldon. He'll be staying with us for a while. Sheldon, this is Rea. She keeps this household running."

The girl—Rea—inclined her head in a bow that was polite but measured. "Welcome, Tsukino-san. I hope you like nikujaga."

Her voice was soft but clear, and there was something in the way she held herself that suggested competence far beyond her years. Not quite adult, but not quite child either. Someone who had learned to be responsible before she should have had to.

"Thank you for having me," Sheldon said, returning the bow. "And for cooking. The house smells wonderful."

Something flickered across Rea's face—surprise, maybe, at the compliment, or assessment of whether it was genuine. Then she nodded once and returned to her work, setting out the remaining dishes with movements that were economical and precise.

Tenchi appeared from somewhere, his hair damp from washing, and immediately claimed the cushion next to where Sheldon was clearly expected to sit. "You're next to me," he announced, as if this were a matter of great importance that had been decided by forces beyond human control. "Rea-neechan is across, and Ojii-chan is at the end."

"Is that the usual arrangement?"

"It's the arrangement for tonight." Tenchi patted the cushion beside him. "Sit, sit. I'm hungry."

---

The meal was simple and exactly what Sheldon needed.

Rice, steaming and perfectly prepared. Nikujaga—a stew of beef and potatoes and onions in a sweet soy broth, the kind of home cooking that reminded him of his grandmother's kitchen even though the flavors were entirely different. Pickled vegetables, sharp and clean. Miso soup with tofu and green onions. And tea, of course, poured by Rea with the same quiet efficiency she brought to everything else.

They ate in a rhythm that felt practiced—Katsuhito at the head of the table, Rea and Tenchi on either side, Sheldon fitting into the space that had apparently been waiting for someone to fill it. The conversation was light, carried mostly by Tenchi's questions and Katsuhito's patient answers, with Rea contributing occasional quiet observations that suggested she was listening to everything even when she wasn't speaking.

"Tsukino-san, do you like it?" Tenchi asked, watching Sheldon eat with the particular intensity of a child who had decided this stranger's opinion mattered.

"It's delicious." Sheldon meant it. The nikujaga was perfectly balanced—not too sweet, not too salty, the beef tender and the potatoes soft without being mushy. "Did you make this, Rea-san?"

The girl looked up from her own bowl, something unreadable in her expression. "It was Kiyone-san's recipe," she said quietly. "I learned it from her."

The name landed in the room like a stone dropped into still water. Tenchi's chopsticks paused in their motion. Katsuhito's eyes flickered toward Rea with something that might have been concern or might have been warning.

"My mother," Tenchi said, filling the silence with the matter-of-fact directness of childhood. "She taught Rea-neechan how to cook before she went away."

"She was a good teacher," Rea said, her voice steady. "I try to make things the way she would have."

The moment stretched, fragile and heavy, and Sheldon recognized it for what it was: grief, held carefully, present in every meal and every ritual and every quiet moment of a household that had learned to function around an absence. Rea cooked Kiyone's recipes. Katsuhito maintained his composure. Tenchi asked his questions and accepted the answers he was given. And the empty space at the table—the cushion that wasn't set out, the portion that wasn't served—existed whether anyone acknowledged it or not.

"It's perfect," Sheldon said, because it was true and because sometimes the only thing you could do with grief was acknowledge the love that had created it. "Thank you for sharing it with me."

Rea's expression softened, just slightly. "You're welcome, Tsukino-san."

---

After dinner, Tenchi insisted on showing Sheldon his collection of wooden blocks.

"Ojii-chan carved them," he explained, leading Sheldon to a corner of the main room where a basket overflowed with shapes of various sizes. "See? This one is a tree, and this one is a horse, and this one is supposed to be a person but it looks more like a stick."

"That's because people are difficult," Katsuhito said from across the room, where he was helping Rea clear the dishes. "Trees and horses have simpler shapes."

"You could practice more."

"I could. But then who would sweep the steps?"

Tenchi considered this logic and apparently found it acceptable. He returned his attention to Sheldon, pressing a wooden block into his hands—a rough approximation of a house, with a peaked roof and a door carved into one side.

"This is my favorite," the boy said. "It's a house. Like the one you're going to fix."

Sheldon turned the block over in his hands, feeling the smoothness of the wood, the care that had gone into shaping it even if the result wasn't quite professional. Someone had made this for a child. Someone had taken the time to carve something that a small boy could hold and imagine with.

"It's a good house," he said.

"It needs a garden." Tenchi pointed to the flat base. "See? No garden. Real houses have gardens."

"Your grandfather could carve one."

"I asked. He said gardens are too hard because they have too many small things." Tenchi sighed with the exasperation of someone whose aesthetic vision exceeded his available resources. "Maybe you could do it. Do you know how to carve?"

"I don't. But I could learn."

The boy's face lit up. "Really? You'd learn? For my house?"

"I'd try. I can't promise it would be good."

"That's okay. Ojii-chan's carvings aren't good either, and I love them anyway."

From across the room, Katsuhito made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been a sigh. "The bath is ready," he said. "Tsukino-san, you should go first. You've had a long day."

---

The ofuro was small but deep, the water hot enough to send steam curling toward the wooden ceiling. Sheldon washed himself first at the small station beside the tub—soap and water and a wooden bucket, the traditional way—then lowered himself into the bath with a groan that came from somewhere deep in his bones.

The heat was almost unbearable for the first few seconds, then shifted to something else entirely: comfort, release, the sensation of muscles unwinding that had been clenched for longer than he'd realized. The water came up to his chest, and he leaned back against the smooth wooden edge, letting his eyes close.

His first day.

He had woken in a field that wasn't his, in a body that was his but also wasn't, in a time that shouldn't have existed for him at all. He had walked through rice paddies and ridden in trucks and climbed hundreds of stone steps. He had met a farmer who remembered his mother, a shopkeeper who welcomed him home, a priest who offered hospitality without asking questions, a child who accepted him without hesitation, and a girl who carried her grief quietly and cooked perfect nikujaga from a dead woman's recipes.

He had a house that needed repairs and a name that came with history and a village that seemed willing to accept him as something other than a stranger.

*Live well*, the presence had said. The only instruction.

He wasn't sure yet what that meant. Wasn't sure what he was supposed to do, or become, or accomplish in this life that had been given to him without explanation. But he was alive. He was here. And for the first time since waking in the chrysanthemum field, he felt something that might have been hope.

The water held him, warm and forgiving. Outside, through the small window, stars were becoming visible in the darkening sky.

He stayed in the bath until the heat had soaked into his bones, until the exhaustion had shifted from burden to weight, until his body felt ready to sleep for a very long time.

---

The guest room was exactly as advertised.

Small—six tatami mats, barely enough space for a futon and the closet that Tenchi had warned contained untouchable baseball cards. A single window, paper-screened, letting in the faint light of stars and the distant glow of what might have been the village below. A low table with a candle that someone had already lit, casting everything in soft amber shadows.

And the door squeaked.

It wasn't a loud squeak—just a soft protest of wood against wood, the complaint of hinges that had been opening and closing for decades. But it was distinctive, the kind of sound you would learn to recognize, the kind of sound that would tell you someone was coming or going even in the dark.

Sheldon slid the door closed behind him, hearing that squeak again, and stood for a moment in the center of the small room.

Someone had laid out the futon while he was bathing. The quilts were old but clean, smelling faintly of sun and cedar—aired recently, then, or at least stored with care. A small pillow sat at the head, and beside it, folded neatly, was a yukata for sleeping.

*Rea*, he thought. She had done this. Set out the futon, lit the candle, made sure a stranger would have what he needed for his first night in an unfamiliar place. The same quiet competence she brought to everything else.

He changed into the yukata, extinguished the candle, and lay down on the futon in the darkness. The quilts were heavier than he expected, warm despite the spring chill, and the tatami beneath him had the particular firmness of floors that had been walked on for generations.

Through the paper screens, he could see the faint shapes of stars. Through the walls, he could hear the distant sounds of the household settling—Katsuhito's measured footsteps, Tenchi's voice asking one more question, Rea's soft response. The ordinary noises of people living together, ending their day, preparing for sleep.

His eyes were heavy. His body was finally, completely exhausted, the kind of exhaustion that came from walking too far and thinking too much and feeling things that didn't have names yet.

Tomorrow, he would begin to figure out what came next. Tomorrow, he would look at the house and make plans and start the process of building something from the pieces he'd been given.

But tonight—tonight he would sleep. In a room with a squeaky door, in a shrine on a mountain, in a life that shouldn't have been his but somehow was.

*Live well.*

He closed his eyes.
