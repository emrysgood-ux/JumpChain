## KATSUHITO POV — Part 1: Scenes 1-50

**POV:** Masaki Katsuhito (Yosho)  
**Timeline:** 04:30:00 JST — 07:15:00 JST  
**Coverage:** Pre-Dawn Awakening → Morning Rituals → Tenchi's Departure for School

---

## SCENE 1
**Time:** 04:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bedroom

The dream released him at the same moment it had for seven hundred years.

His eyes opened to darkness. The ceiling beams above him—replaced twice in his lifetime, the current set installed in 1847—held the faint smell of cedar that never quite faded. Outside, the mountain breathed its pre-dawn breath, cool air settling into the valleys before sunlight could warm it.

He didn't move yet. The body he presented to the world required performance. The body that existed beneath the illusion required nothing.

---

## SCENE 2
**Time:** 04:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bedroom

The futon beneath him held warmth from his sleeping form. A human comfort. He'd grown to appreciate human comforts over the centuries—the particular satisfaction of a body at rest, the gradual transition from sleep to waking that mortality enforced.

His true form didn't need sleep. Not really. But the appearance of an elderly shrine keeper required the rhythms of an elderly body, and he'd found that maintaining the pretense included maintaining the habits.

Besides, dreams still came. Even after seven hundred years.

---

## SCENE 3
**Time:** 04:30:34 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bedroom

This morning's dream had been about Jurai.

The throne room. Sunlight through windows that opened onto a sky that wasn't quite blue—the particular tint of his homeworld's atmosphere, something between azure and violet that he'd almost forgotten existed. His father's voice, speaking words he couldn't quite remember now that waking had taken them.

He'd stopped trying to hold onto those dreams centuries ago. They came when they came. They left when they left.

---

## SCENE 4
**Time:** 04:30:51 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bedroom

The room around him contained nothing of Jurai.

Tatami mats. Paper walls. A low table holding a water pitcher and cup. The accumulated simplicity of a life deliberately stripped of everything he'd been born to—the titles, the responsibilities, the power that came with being first prince of an interstellar empire.

He'd traded all of it for this mountain. For this shrine. For the woman he'd come to find and the lineage she'd given him.

He would make the same trade again without hesitation.

---

## SCENE 5
**Time:** 04:31:08 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bedroom

He rose in a single motion.

The elderly appearance he maintained didn't require the stiff joints and careful movements that actual age imposed. He could have bounded to his feet like a young man—his true form was still in its prime, would remain in its prime for millennia yet. But habits developed over centuries had their own momentum, and the performance had become comfortable.

Besides, Tenchi slept three rooms away. The boy's hearing was sharp.

---

## SCENE 6
**Time:** 04:31:25 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, standing

The floorboards didn't creak under his weight.

He knew which ones would protest and which would remain silent—knowledge accumulated step by step over decades of pre-dawn risings. The path from futon to door existed as much in muscle memory as in conscious thought, worn smooth by repetition.

Three steps forward. Turn left. Avoid the loose board near the corner.

---

## SCENE 7
**Time:** 04:31:42 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, hallway

The hallway stretched dark in both directions.

To his left, the main room where he would prepare tea. To his right, the corridor leading to Tenchi's room, where his grandson slept with the particular abandon of a four-year-old who had never learned to fear the night.

He turned left. Tea first. Then prayers. Then the mountain.

---

## SCENE 8
**Time:** 04:31:59 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The brazier held last night's coals, banked and sleeping but not yet dead.

He knelt beside it, the motion automatic, and began the small adjustments that would coax it back to useful heat. A poker to redistribute the ash. Fresh charcoal added in measured increments. The particular breath of air directed to encourage rather than overwhelm.

Fire responded to attention the same way everything else did.

---

## SCENE 9
**Time:** 04:32:16 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The kettle went on to heat.

He'd owned this kettle for eighty-three years—iron, cast in Iwate Prefecture, given to him by a pilgrim whose name he'd long forgotten but whose gratitude he still remembered. The metal had developed a patina that would have horrified a collector and which he valued precisely because it marked time in ways his own body refused to.

Water from the mountain spring. The same spring that had fed this shrine since before his arrival.

---

## SCENE 10
**Time:** 04:32:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

While the water heated, he allowed his senses to expand.

Not the human senses—the sharp hearing, the adequate vision that the illusion provided. The other senses. The ones that connected him to the mountain, to Funaho, to the web of energy that ran through this place like blood through veins.

The tree was awake. The tree was always awake.

*Good morning,* he thought toward her, knowing she would hear.

---

## SCENE 11
**Time:** 04:32:50 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Funaho's response came not in words but in warmth.

The sensation spread through his chest—a greeting, an acknowledgment, the particular texture of companionship that had sustained him through seven centuries of exile. She couldn't leave this mountain any more than he could, their roots grown too deep into Earth's soil to ever be transplanted.

But they were together. That had always been enough.

---

## SCENE 12
**Time:** 04:33:07 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Something felt different this morning.

The realization surfaced slowly, rising through layers of routine like a stone ascending through still water. Not wrong—nothing alarmed him. But different. The texture of the energy flowing through the mountain carried a note he hadn't heard in years.

Perhaps decades.

Perhaps longer.

---

## SCENE 13
**Time:** 04:33:24 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

He closed his eyes and reached deeper.

The mountain's energy moved in familiar patterns—the slow pulse of the ley lines, the quicker rhythm of the spring water, the dream-slow breathing of the forest. All of it normal. All of it as it should be.

But beneath those layers, something waited. Something that hadn't been there yesterday.

---

## SCENE 14
**Time:** 04:33:41 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Funaho felt it too.

Her warmth carried a note of curiosity now—the particular attention she gave to phenomena that interested her. The tree had seen more than he had, in some ways. Her roots reached deeper into the earth's memory than his senses could follow. If something had changed, she would know before he did.

*What is it?* he asked without words.

The answer came as an image: a seed falling into prepared soil.

---

## SCENE 15
**Time:** 04:33:58 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The kettle began to whisper.

He opened his eyes and returned to the human world, to the practical reality of water approaching boil and morning tea needing preparation. Whatever the mountain was trying to tell him would become clear in time. Seven hundred years had taught him the particular patience required for dealing with things larger than himself.

The tea leaves were in the cabinet. The cup was on the table. The morning would proceed as mornings did.

---

## SCENE 16
**Time:** 04:34:15 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

He measured leaves into the pot with practiced precision.

Green tea. Sencha from Uji, the same region that had supplied this household for three generations. The ritual of preparation mattered as much as the tea itself—the focused attention, the deliberate movements, the acknowledgment that even small acts deserved care.

Kiyone had taught him that. His daughter, dead now for several years. Her absence still shaped the mornings.

---

## SCENE 17
**Time:** 04:34:32 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The water reached temperature. He poured.

Steam rose from the pot in a thin column, catching the first hint of gray light filtering through the windows. Dawn approached. The mountain would soon wake fully, and with it the demands of a shrine keeper's day.

But for now, this quiet moment belonged to him.

---

## SCENE 18
**Time:** 04:34:49 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

He carried his tea to the engawa.

The covered porch ran along the residence's eastern side, facing the shrine grounds and the forest beyond. From here he could see Funaho—her crown visible above the other trees, her presence a constant anchor in his perception.

The sky had lightened enough to distinguish shapes. The first birds would begin singing soon.

---

## SCENE 19
**Time:** 04:35:06 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa (porch)

The morning air carried the particular crispness of early April.

Cherry blossoms had peaked last week. Their petals still lay scattered across the shrine grounds, pink against the darker earth, a reminder that beauty was temporary but beauty also returned. He'd seen seven hundred springs on this mountain. Each one surprised him in small ways.

He sipped his tea. The heat spread through his chest.

---

## SCENE 20
**Time:** 04:35:23 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The eastern horizon showed the first color of sunrise.

Orange bleeding into pink, the gradients shifting moment by moment as Earth rotated toward its star. He'd seen sunrises on a dozen worlds, but none quite matched this one—the particular quality of light filtered through this atmosphere, the specific palette that humans took for granted because they'd never known anything else.

He no longer took it for granted. He hadn't for centuries.

---

## SCENE 21
**Time:** 04:35:40 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

A bush warbler called from the forest edge.

*Hō-hoke-kyo.* The first voice of morning, the sound that meant spring in this country more than any calendar date could. He listened as the bird repeated its call, establishing territory, announcing its existence to the waking world.

The birds didn't know what he was. To them, he was simply another presence on the mountain, no more significant than the shrine itself.

---

## SCENE 22
**Time:** 04:35:57 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

His thoughts returned to the anomaly he'd sensed.

Something had arrived. Or something was arriving. The energy signature remained indistinct, like trying to identify a sound heard from great distance. But it carried weight. Purpose. The particular density that suggested intent rather than accident.

Funaho's image returned to him: a seed falling into prepared soil.

*Whose seed?* he wondered. *Whose soil?*

---

## SCENE 23
**Time:** 04:36:14 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The question would have to wait.

Footsteps padded behind him—small feet on wooden floors, the particular rhythm of a child not yet fully awake. Tenchi had risen earlier than usual. The boy often did on Monday mornings, his body anticipating the school week before his mind fully engaged.

"Ojii-chan?"

The voice carried the particular rasp of recent sleep.

---

## SCENE 24
**Time:** 04:36:31 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

He turned to find his grandson in the doorway.

Four years old, nearly five. Hair disheveled from sleep, wearing the blue pajamas his grandmother had bought before she died. The boy rubbed one eye with his fist while the other eye tracked his grandfather with the intensity Tenchi brought to everything.

"Good morning, Tenchi."

"It's early."

"Yes."

---

## SCENE 25
**Time:** 04:36:48 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The boy shuffled onto the porch and settled beside him.

Tenchi didn't ask for permission or invitation. He simply claimed the space as his own, the particular confidence of a child who had never been made to feel unwelcome. His small body radiated warmth, the elevated temperature that children maintained without effort.

"I heard the bird," Tenchi said.

"The bush warbler."

"Mm."

---

## SCENE 26
**Time:** 04:37:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

They sat in silence as the sky continued to lighten.

The bird called again. Another answered from deeper in the forest—a territorial negotiation conducted in song, boundaries being established for the breeding season ahead. Tenchi listened with the attention he gave to all natural phenomena, cataloging without analyzing.

The boy had instincts he didn't yet understand. Instincts that came from both bloodlines.

---

## SCENE 27
**Time:** 04:37:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"Is today a special day?" Tenchi asked.

The question caught him off-guard. Children noticed things adults had learned to filter out—the subtle shifts in atmosphere that accumulated experience taught people to ignore. Tenchi's senses weren't sharp enough to detect what he'd sensed, but the boy might have picked up on his own distraction.

"Why do you ask?"

"You're thinking hard."

---

## SCENE 28
**Time:** 04:37:39 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

He considered how much to share.

Tenchi would learn about his heritage eventually—the Jurai blood, the Royal Trees, the power that slept in his cells waiting for awakening. But not yet. Not at four years old, when the world still felt safe and comprehensible. That knowledge could wait until the boy was ready to carry it.

"Someone may come to visit today," he said. "Someone important."

---

## SCENE 29
**Time:** 04:37:56 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Tenchi's eyes widened slightly.

"Who?"

"I don't know yet." The honest answer. The truthful one. "The mountain will tell me when they arrive."

The boy accepted this with the particular flexibility of children. Mountains speaking to his grandfather was no stranger than any other element of his world—the tree that watched, the shrine that held power, the prayers that went somewhere even if he didn't know where.

---

## SCENE 30
**Time:** 04:38:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"Will they be nice?"

The question contained real concern. Tenchi had learned young that not everyone who came to the shrine arrived with good intentions. Pilgrims seeking comfort. Tourists seeking photographs. Occasionally, those seeking to use sacred spaces for purposes the spaces weren't meant for.

"I believe so," he said. "But we'll see."

---

## SCENE 31
**Time:** 04:38:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The sun crested the eastern ridge.

Light flooded the shrine grounds in a sudden wave, transforming shadows into defined shapes, turning the scattered cherry blossoms from gray to pink. Tenchi squinted against the brightness but didn't look away. The boy had his mother's stubbornness about such things.

"Sunrise," Tenchi announced, as if confirming a fact.

"Sunrise," he agreed.

---

## SCENE 32
**Time:** 04:38:47 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The morning had officially begun.

He rose in a motion that looked stiff but felt fluid, the performance of age he'd maintained so long it had become second nature. Tenchi scrambled up beside him, small hands braced against the porch floor, energy building now that waking was complete.

"Breakfast?" The universal question of the young.

"After prayers."

---

## SCENE 33
**Time:** 04:39:04 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"Can I do prayers with you?"

The request came most mornings. Tenchi found the ritual fascinating for reasons he probably couldn't articulate—the particular movements, the words that didn't quite make sense, the feeling that something listened even if he couldn't see what.

"If you can be quiet."

"I can be quiet."

The statement required no rebuttal. Both of them knew Tenchi's relationship with silence.

---

## SCENE 34
**Time:** 04:39:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, moving inside

They returned to the main room together.

The brazier still held warmth, the kettle still held hot water, and the morning still held the indefinable sense of waiting. He helped Tenchi into day clothes suitable for shrine work—simple hakama and a white top that the boy would inevitably dirty before school.

"Arms up."

Tenchi complied, vibrating with contained energy.

---

## SCENE 35
**Time:** 04:39:38 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The daily costume required for a shrine keeper's grandson fit the daily costume required for a shrine keeper himself.

He changed his own clothing with practiced efficiency—the layers building the image of an elderly man devoted to tradition. The hakama tied just so. The white haori settling on shoulders that weren't as bowed as they appeared.

The image in the mirror showed Masaki Katsuhito. The reality beneath remained Yosho of Jurai.

---

## SCENE 36
**Time:** 04:39:55 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

"Ready?" Tenchi bounced on his heels.

"Almost."

He collected the purification items from their cabinet—the sakaki branches, the container of salt, the small bell that called attention to ceremony. The objects had accumulated meaning through years of use, their physical forms weighted with the intention they'd absorbed.

Tools of a trade he'd chosen. A calling he'd made his own.

---

## SCENE 37
**Time:** 04:40:12 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, exiting residence

The morning air struck cool against his face as they stepped outside.

The shrine grounds lay quiet in the early light, unmarked by any visitors' footsteps since yesterday's closing. Dew sparkled on the grass that bordered the stone paths. The shrine itself—the main hall, the auxiliary buildings, the structures that accumulated over centuries—waited with patient dignity.

Beside him, Tenchi's breath made small clouds in the cold.

---

## SCENE 38
**Time:** 04:40:29 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, path to main hall

They walked the path together, their footsteps the only sounds.

The stones had been laid generations ago, each one selected for size and shape, fitted together without mortar to create a surface that would drain and endure. He knew every stone by feel, could have walked this path blindfolded if necessity demanded.

Tenchi skipped every third step. A pattern he'd invented weeks ago and maintained without explanation.

---

## SCENE 39
**Time:** 04:40:46 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approaching main hall

The main hall rose before them.

Wood and tile, the classic architecture of Shinto shrines, rebuilt three times since his arrival but always maintaining the essential form. The morning light caught the shimenawa rope above the entrance—twisted rice straw marking the boundary between secular and sacred.

"Good morning, shrine," Tenchi said quietly.

The habit had started last year. He hadn't corrected it.

---

## SCENE 40
**Time:** 04:41:03 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, entrance

They paused at the threshold.

Shrine protocol required specific actions at specific points—the psychological boundaries that transformed a visitor from ordinary to prepared. He bowed twice, clapped twice, bowed once more. Beside him, Tenchi mimicked the actions with the particular earnestness of practice.

"Good," he said.

Tenchi glowed at the praise.

---

## SCENE 41
**Time:** 04:41:20 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, interior

The interior held the stillness that accumulated overnight.

Altar cloths undisturbed. Offering vessels empty and waiting. The subtle smell of old incense embedded in wood grain, the particular perfume of sacred spaces maintained through generations. Light entered through high windows, falling in precise shafts across the floor.

He approached the altar. Tenchi remained two steps behind, maintaining the position he'd been taught.

---

## SCENE 42
**Time:** 04:41:37 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, before altar

The morning prayers began with silence.

He closed his eyes and let his awareness expand again—through the shrine, through the grounds, through the mountain that held them both. The familiar energies answered his attention: the shrine's accumulated faith, the forest's patient growth, Funaho's deep roots anchoring everything.

And beneath it all, the new presence. Closer now than it had been at dawn.

---

## SCENE 43
**Time:** 04:41:54 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, before altar

The prayers themselves were simple.

Words asking for protection. Words asking for clarity. Words acknowledging the forces that moved through this place regardless of whether anyone named them or not. He'd written versions of these prayers himself, adapting older forms to newer needs, keeping the essence while releasing the specifics.

Behind him, Tenchi's breathing had slowed. The boy found stillness when the space demanded it.

---

## SCENE 44
**Time:** 04:42:11 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, before altar

He rang the small bell.

The sound spread through the hall, through the grounds, through the mountain's awareness. A signal. A notification. The morning's formal beginning, marked in vibration rather than words.

The energy he'd sensed stirred in response. Not nearby—not yet. But aware now. Oriented toward this place.

*Coming,* he thought. *Whatever you are, you're coming.*

---

## SCENE 45
**Time:** 04:42:28 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, before altar

He completed the prayers with another bow.

The formality satisfied the shrine's expectations, if shrines had expectations. More importantly, it satisfied his own sense of appropriate attention—the acknowledgment that maintaining sacred spaces required maintaining sacred practices, even when the practitioner's own relationship with the sacred was more complicated than most.

"All done?" Tenchi whispered.

"All done."

---

## SCENE 46
**Time:** 04:42:45 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, interior

They moved through the morning's additional tasks.

Fresh water for the offering vessels. New sakaki branches replacing yesterday's wilted arrangement. The small cleaning tasks that kept a shrine presentable for visitors who might arrive at any moment. Tenchi helped where he could, carrying items, fetching supplies, learning through participation.

The boy asked questions constantly. He answered when answers served.

---

## SCENE 47
**Time:** 04:43:02 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, altar maintenance

"Why do we change the water every day?"

The question came as Tenchi held the empty vessel, waiting for it to be refilled.

"Because offerings should be fresh. Would you give your friend day-old rice?"

Tenchi considered this seriously. "No."

"Then we don't give the kami day-old water."

The logic satisfied. The task continued.

---

## SCENE 48
**Time:** 04:43:19 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, near window

A shaft of sunlight had moved to illuminate the altar.

The timing was intentional—the hall had been oriented so that morning light would reach the sacred space at a specific hour, marking the day's progression through the building itself. Architecture as calendar. Design as devotion.

Tenchi noticed. "The light moved."

"It moves every day."

"But it looks like it's pointing."

---

## SCENE 49
**Time:** 04:43:36 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, near window

The observation carried more insight than Tenchi knew.

Sacred architecture directed attention. The light didn't just illuminate—it guided, emphasized, created hierarchy within space. A thousand small decisions accumulated in this hall's design, each one intended to shape the experience of anyone who entered.

"You're very observant," he said.

Tenchi beamed.

---

## SCENE 50
**Time:** 04:43:53 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, completing tasks

The morning shrine work concluded.

Vessels filled, branches placed, surfaces dusted, floor swept. The main hall now stood ready to receive whatever the day might bring—pilgrims, tourists, or something else entirely. The space held patience. The space knew how to wait.

"Breakfast now?" Tenchi asked.

"Breakfast now."

They descended the hall's steps together, grandfather and grandson, moving toward the ordinary warmth of food and family.
