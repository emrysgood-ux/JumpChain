## LAMBDA VS. OTHER POWER SYSTEMS

### Lambda Power (Sailor Moon Universe)
| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Nature** | Creative, nurturing |
| **Source** | Galaxy Cauldron |
| **Feel** | Warm, golden, maternal |
| **Primary Use** | Creation, protection, healing |
| **Combat Application** | Defensive, purification |

### Light Hawk Wings (Tenchi Universe)

| **Source** | Chousin/Tsunami |
| **Feel** | Electric, crystalline |
| **Primary Use** | Offense, defense, transcendence |
| **Combat Application** | Direct, devastating |

### Why They Don't Mix
- Different dimensional origins
- Different fundamental physics
- Like incompatible operating systems
- Can exist in same person, don't interface

## SHELDON'S LAMBDA

### What He Has
| Ability | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Reconstruction | Complete | Body remade at resurrection |
| Longevity | Passive | Extended lifespan |
| Lambda Infusion | Unconscious | Love in food |
| Warmth sensing | Active | Feels Cosmos's presence |
| Star seed stability | Passive | Soul anchored |
| Healing factor | Minor | Recovers faster than normal |

### What He Doesn't Have
| Ability | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Combat applications | Lambda is nurturing |
| Transformation | No Sailor form |
| Attacks | Against Lambda nature |
| Full Cosmos access | Not goddess-level |

### Manifestation
- Doesn't know it's called "Lambda"
- Experiences as "warmth," "presence"
- Functions automatically
- Enhances his nurturing nature

## DETECTION

### By Juraian Sensors
- Registers as "unknown cosmic energy"
- Not Chousin-derived
- Not catalogued in their systems
- Anomaly alert

### By Washu (Year 13+)
- "Another god's fingerprints"
- Not from their experiment
- Different dimensional origin
- Fascinating puzzle

### By Katsuhito
- Senses "something unusual"
- Can't identify specifically
- Knows it's cosmic-level
- Patient observation

## STORY IMPLICATIONS

### What Lambda Does for Narrative
1. Makes Sheldon special without overpowered
2. Explains his nurturing abilities
3. Creates mystery for Washu
4. Connects him to Cosmos
5. Differentiates from Tenchi's power

### What Lambda Doesn't Do
1. Make him a fighter
2. Let him compete with LHW users
3. Give him cosmic-scale abilities
4. Override his humanity
5. Make him invincible

## THE INFUSION EFFECT

### What Happens
When Sheldon cooks, Lambda subtly infuses the food with:
- Nurturing energy
- Emotional warmth
- Healing comfort
- Love (literally)

### The Effect on Eaters
- Feel safer, warmer
- Emotional comfort beyond taste
- Minor healing effect (emotional)
- Sense of being cared for

### Critical Notes
- Sheldon NEVER learns about this
- Washu detects but doesn't tell him
- It's unconscious, not controllable
- Works because he genuinely cares
