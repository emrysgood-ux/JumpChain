# DAY 15 - APRIL 17, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **Two Weeks**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-020 | Counting**
Sheldon-san had been here for two weeks. Tenchi counted on his fingers. Fourteen days. That was a lot of days.

"How long will you stay?"

The man looked at him over breakfast. "As long as your grandfather lets me."

"Forever?"

"We'll see."

"We'll see" again. But this time it sounded different. Hopeful.

---

**SCENE 041-060 | School Thinking**
At school, Tenchi thought about forever. Forever was a long time. Longer than two weeks. Longer than he could count.

Mama wasn't forever. She was supposed to be but she wasn't.

Maybe Sheldon-san could be forever instead.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 161-200)

Grandpa and Sheldon-san were talking when Tenchi came home. They looked serious.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong," Grandpa said. "We're discussing the old house."

"The sad house?"

"It won't be sad forever. Sheldon-san is going to help fix it."

Tenchi looked at the man. "You can fix sad things?"

"I can try."

# DAY 16 - APRIL 18, 1989 (TUESDAY)

**The Roof Problem**

Grandpa and Sheldon-san went to look at the sad house roof. They took a long time.

When they came back, Sheldon-san's face was worried.

"What's wrong with the roof?"

"Some parts are broken. We need to find people who know how to fix it."

"Can't you fix it?"

"This needs special help."

Even Sheldon-san couldn't fix everything. That was scary but also okay. Knowing when you need help was smart, Grandpa always said.

# DAY 17 - APRIL 19, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)

**Yamada-san**

A man came to look at the roof. Yamada-san. He had big hands and a loud laugh.

"This one's watching everything," Yamada-san said, pointing at Tenchi.

"He's curious," Sheldon-san said.

"Good trait for a boy."

Tenchi stood taller. Curious was a good thing.

---

# DAY 18 - APRIL 20, 1989 (THURSDAY)

**Birthday Talk**

"Your birthday is in four days," Sheldon-san said.

"I know! I'll be five!"

"Five is a big number."

"It's THIS many." Tenchi held up his whole hand.

"What do you want for your birthday?"

Tenchi thought. He could ask for toys. Or candy. Or a book.

"I want you to still be here."

The man got quiet. Then he nodded, slow and serious. "I'll be here."

---

# DAY 19 - APRIL 21, 1989 (FRIDAY)

**Papa Is Coming**

"Your father will arrive tomorrow," Grandpa said.

Papa! Tenchi jumped up and down. Papa came sometimes, but not enough times.

"Will he meet Sheldon-san?"

"Yes."

"Will he like him?"

Grandpa made a face Tenchi couldn't read. "We'll see."

---

# DAY 20 - APRIL 22, 1989 (SATURDAY)

**Papa Arrives**

Papa's car came up the mountain road. Tenchi ran to meet it.

"Papa! Papa!"

Strong arms lifted him. Papa smelled like buildings and soap.

"Look how big you're getting."

"I'm almost five!"

"I know. That's why I'm here."

---

**Papa Meets Sheldon-san**

Papa shook the man's hand. They looked at each other for a long time.

"Thank you for helping my father."

"It's my pleasure."

Papa's eyes were doing something. Checking, like when he looked at buildings.

"We'll talk more."

Tenchi didn't understand why grown-ups needed to talk so much. But Papa was here. That was the important part.

---

# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)

**The Day Before**

Tomorrow was birthday!

Tenchi was too excited to sit still. He followed everyone around. Papa watched him with tired-happy eyes.

"Are you ready to be five?"

"YES."

Papa laughed. It was a good sound. Tenchi wished he laughed more.

---

Sheldon-san made a special dinner. Papa ate a lot.

"This is exceptional."

"Thank you."

"Where did you learn to cook like this?"

The man paused. "I'm not entirely sure."

Papa's eyes did the checking thing again. But then he nodded.

"Well. It's appreciated."
