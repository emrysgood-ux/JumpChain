# CENTRAL NARRATIVE QUESTION

*How do I live inside a mystery I cannot solve?*

Sheldon Carter—theoretical physicist with four PhDs—died in a particle accelerator cascade failure in Fairbanks, Alaska. He wakes in a chrysanthemum field in rural Japan with a body reset to age 30, documents claiming a history he never lived, and fluency in Japanese he never learned.

Chapter 1 traces his gradual surrender—not to despair, but to acceptance. By Day 28, he has not solved anything. He has simply stopped requiring solution as a precondition for living.
