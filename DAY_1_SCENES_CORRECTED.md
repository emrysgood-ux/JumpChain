## CORRECTED SCENE 256
**Time:** 16:51:24 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, sitting with thoughts

He pulled the letter from his wallet.

The envelope still sealed, his name written in that trembling brushwork. The photograph showed an elderly man—weathered hands, quiet authority in his posture, the particular patience of someone who had learned to wait for things that mattered.

Uncle Kiyoshi. The name surfaced from somewhere, attached to the face without conscious effort.

He broke the seal.

## CORRECTED SCENE 257
**Time:** 16:53:41 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, reading letter

The letter was written in careful Japanese, the brushwork deliberate despite a slight tremor.

*Sheldon—*

*Your mother carried that name her whole life, even in America, even after she married your father. She never stopped being a Tsukino in her heart. That you chose to honor her that way when you changed your name... it would have made her weep with happiness. It makes me proud to call you nephew.*

*A man needs time to grieve properly, and you never took that time. After Yuki passed, you buried yourself in work. I understood—we all have our ways of surviving. But four years is long enough to run.*

*The house will give you quiet. The village will give you space. Masaki-san knows you're coming and will help you settle in. The mountain has always accepted our family.*

*Haruko is already planning what to cook when we visit for Obon. You cannot escape her feeding you—I have tried for forty years and failed. Fumiko asks about you often. She barely remembers your visit in 1980, but she wants to meet you properly now that you're both adults.*

*Your mother used to say you were meticulous, like your father. She meant it as praise. Take that meticulousness and apply it to healing. The house is yours. Make it a home again.*

*When you are ready—not before—come to Osaka. We will drink tea and I will tell you stories about your mother that she never told you herself.*

*Your uncle,*  
*Kiyoshi*

## CORRECTED SCENE 258
**Time:** 16:55:58 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, processing letter

He read the letter twice.

The man who wrote it was alive. Waiting in Osaka with his wife, with stories about a mother Sheldon couldn't remember. The invitation carried no urgency—*when you are ready, not before*—but the expectation was clear. Family existed. Family wanted connection.

The letter assumed shared history. References to a 1980 visit. To a name change he'd apparently chosen. To four years of grief he hadn't taken time to process.

None of it matched his memories. All of it, according to his documents, was true.

He folded the letter along its original creases and returned it to the envelope. The house around him held the silence of waiting—not for death, as he'd assumed, but for life to return.

His uncle was alive. His cousin wanted to meet him. His aunt was already planning meals.

He had a family he couldn't remember.

The weight of that settled into him differently than the weight of inheritance from the dead. This was obligation that breathed. People who would ask questions, notice gaps, expect the warmth of recognition he couldn't provide.

He would have to learn to be their nephew, their cousin, their family. Or learn to explain why he couldn't be.

Neither option seemed simple.

## CORRECTED SCENES 85-89 (Bus Stop Woman)

**Note:** Replace "Yamamoto Haruko" with "Tanaka Sachiko" in all instances.

### CORRECTED SCENE 84
**Time:** 15:16:04 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

The woman entered the shelter and sat at the opposite end of the bench.

She studied him openly—not rude, but curious. A foreigner at a rural bus stop warranted examination. He met her gaze without challenge, offering a small nod of acknowledgment.

"Konnichiwa," she said. Good afternoon.

"Konnichiwa," he replied. The word came easily, his accent unremarkable.

Her eyebrows rose slightly. She hadn't expected fluent Japanese.

---

### CORRECTED SCENE 85
**Time:** 15:16:38 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"You speak well," she said. A statement, not a question.

"Thank you." He kept his response simple. His Japanese was fluent—he'd learned it for academic purposes, spent summers in Kyoto improving his comprehension—but he didn't know how to explain that fluency to a stranger.

"Where are you going?" Direct questions, the privilege of age.

"I'm trying to reach my house. Near a shrine, I think. My family name is Tsukino."

---

### CORRECTED SCENE 86
**Time:** 15:17:12 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

Her expression changed.

Recognition, perhaps. Or something else—a sharpening of attention, a reorganization of whatever assumptions she'd made about him.

"Tsukino," she repeated. "The house by Masaki Shrine."

"You know it?"

"Everyone knows it. The house has been empty since Yuki-san passed. Four years now." She paused, her eyes searching his face. "You have her eyes."

---

### CORRECTED SCENE 87
**Time:** 15:17:46 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"She was my mother," he said, testing the words.

The woman's face softened with something that might have been compassion. "I thought so. I'm Tanaka Sachiko. I knew Yuki-san when we were girls—before she left for America."

A childhood friend of his mother's. Someone who had known the woman he was supposed to have lost.

"I've been away," he said. "For a long time."

"Too long, perhaps." Her voice carried no judgment. "But you're here now. That matters."

---

### CORRECTED SCENE 88
**Time:** 15:18:20 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"The shrine," he said, redirecting. "How far is it?"

"The bus goes there. Last stop on the eastbound route." She gestured toward the schedule board. "Masaki Katsuhito tends the shrine. He's expecting you—the whole village has been expecting you since word came that Yuki-san's son would finally return."

Finally return. The phrase suggested delay, perhaps judgment. He'd been expected and had taken four years to arrive.

---

### CORRECTED SCENE 89
**Time:** 15:18:54 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"Tell Katsuhito-san that Tanaka Sachiko sends her regards," she added. "And tell him the persimmons this year will be exceptional. He'll know what that means."

A message wrapped in local knowledge, private significance. The currency of communities that had existed for generations.

"I will. Thank you for your help."

"You're Yuki-san's son." She settled back on the bench, her examination complete. "Of course I would help. Welcome home, Tsukino-san."

---

### SCENE 110 CORRECTION

The name relay to Katsuhito must also be updated:

**Original:**
> "Tell Katsuhito-san that Yamamoto Haruko sends her regards."

**Corrected:**
> "Tell Katsuhito-san that Tanaka Sachiko sends her regards. And tell him the persimmons this year will be exceptional."
