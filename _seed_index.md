23.1 --- SEED/HARVEST TRACKING REGISTRY (Law 68)

This registry tracks all narrative foreshadowing elements. Every
\'seed\' planted must eventually be \'harvested\' or explicitly
ABANDONED with user permission.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Field**          **Description**
  ------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  **SEED-###**       Unique identifier (sequential numbering)

  **Planted**        Scene/Chapter where element was introduced

  **Element**        What was introduced (object, phrase, behavior, hint)

  **Intended         What this seed sets up for future revelation
  Payoff**           

  **Status**         OPEN \| HARVESTED \| ABANDONED (with permission)
