## MASAKI NOBUYUKI POV
## **The Birthday Visit: Assessing the Stranger**

---

## ABOUT NOBUYUKI'S POV

Nobuyuki Masaki is Tenchi's father. He is NOT a normal human—he was born in the mid-1800s with diluted Juraian heritage (120-200 years old in 1989), though he appears to be in his mid-40s. He works as an architect in Kurashiki.

**Character Notes:**
- Grieving his wife Kiyone (died ~1986-1987)
- Complex relationship with his father (Yosho/Katsuhito)
- Protective of Tenchi
- Professional eye for structural work
- Knows his Juraian background but doesn't dwell on it

# DAY 20 - APRIL 22, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## **Arrival and First Impressions**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-030 | The Drive Up**
The road to the shrine never changed. Nobuyuki had driven it hundreds of times across decades. The trees grew older. The pavement cracked and was repaired. But the mountain itself remained.

His son was turning five. Kiyone should be here.

She wasn't. She would never be here again.

Nobuyuki gripped the steering wheel and focused on the road.

---

**SCENE 031-050 | Tenchi**
The boy came running before the car fully stopped.

"Papa! Papa!"

That word. That small body launching into his arms. The weight of his son, alive and growing.

"Look how big you're getting."

"I'm almost five!"

"I know. That's why I'm here."

He held on longer than necessary. Tenchi didn't seem to mind.

---

**SCENE 051-080 | The Stranger**
The man waited on the engawa. Tall, Western features, brown hair with an odd reddish undertone. Eyes that seemed normal at first, but—

Silver flecks. Barely visible, but there. Nobuyuki had lived too long to miss details like that.

His father stood nearby, watching. That alone was information. Yosho didn't watch things that weren't worth watching.

---

**SCENE 081-100 | Introduction**
"Thank you for helping my father."

"It's my pleasure."

American accent, but fluent Japanese. The handshake was firm, appropriate. The man met his eyes without challenge or submission.

Nobuyuki had spent decades reading people. Clients, contractors, bureaucrats. This one was... difficult to read. Not because he was hiding something, but because what he projected was so simple it seemed impossible.

Genuine helpfulness. No apparent agenda.

Nobody was that simple.

"We'll talk more."

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-140 | Observation**
Nobuyuki watched the stranger with Tenchi. The man was patient—genuinely patient, not performatively so. He answered questions without condescension. He matched the boy's energy without being exhausting.

Tenchi clearly adored him. That was concerning and reassuring in equal measure.

Concerning: attachment was vulnerability.
Reassuring: children's instincts were often accurate.

---

**SCENE 141-180 | The Old House**
"He's restoring the Tsukino property," Yosho said.

Nobuyuki looked at the structure. His architect's eye catalogued the damage. Roof sagging, structural concerns, decades of neglect.

"That's a significant project."

"He's committed to it."

"With what funding?"

"His own resources. Though he's proposed a lease arrangement for the future."

A man with resources, skills, and a willingness to invest in rural property with no obvious return. Either very clever or very strange.

---

**SCENE 181-200 | Questions**
"What do you know about him? Really?"

Yosho's face was the mask he'd worn for seven centuries. "He arrived claiming memory loss. His skills emerged without apparent training. His energy signature is unusual but not threatening."

"Unusual how?"

"Unlike anything I've encountered. But directed toward construction, not destruction."

That was a great deal more information than his father usually volunteered.

"You trust him."

"I'm allowing him to prove himself."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-250 | Dinner**
The food was exceptional. Not merely good—exceptional in a way that suggested either extensive training or something else entirely.

"Where did you learn to cook like this?"

"I'm not entirely sure." The stranger's expression was rueful, honest. "It comes naturally, but I don't remember learning it."

Amnesia. Possible. People experienced genuine memory loss after trauma.

Or a convenient explanation for skills that shouldn't exist.

---

**SCENE 251-280 | Private Conversation**
After Tenchi went to bed, the three adults sat with tea.

"I need to ask directly," Nobuyuki said. "What are your intentions here?"

The stranger considered the question. "To restore the property. To be useful. To find a place where I belong."

"That's very general."

"I wish I could be more specific. But I don't have hidden motives because I barely have motives at all. I woke up here, and this is what makes sense to do."

It was either the most honest answer Nobuyuki had ever heard, or the most carefully constructed lie.

---

**SCENE 281-299 | Late Night**
Nobuyuki lay awake in his old room.

The stranger's energy was wrong. Not dangerous-wrong, just wrong. Like a note that didn't belong in a chord but somehow made the music more interesting.

His father tolerated the man. His son loved him. The shrine was cleaner than it had been in years.

Perhaps "wrong" didn't mean "bad."

Perhaps it just meant "unknown."

---

# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## **The Day Before the Birthday**

---

## MORNING

Nobuyuki woke to the smell of miso soup and grilling fish. The stranger was in the kitchen before anyone else, preparing food that would shame most restaurants.

"You're up early."

"I like mornings."

"Even in America?"

A pause. "I don't remember American mornings. Only that I came from there."

---

## AFTERNOON

Tenchi was vibrating with excitement. Tomorrow was the birthday. The boy couldn't sit still.

The stranger had infinite patience for it. Redirected energy into small tasks, kept the child engaged without exhausting him.

Nobuyuki observed. This was not learned behavior. No parent developed this level of intuition without years of practice. Either the man had raised children before (and forgotten), or his instincts were simply inhuman.

---

## EVENING

"He's good with children," Nobuyuki said to his father.

"Yes."

"Too good."

Yosho sipped his tea. "Perhaps. Or perhaps some people are simply suited to care."

"You don't believe that any more than I do."

"I believe he is genuinely invested in Tenchi's wellbeing. The source of that investment is uncertain. The investment itself is real."

Nobuyuki considered this. His father had never been wrong about threats. Not in seven hundred years.

"You'd tell me if I should be concerned."

"I would tell you if action were required. Concern is personal. You'll feel it or you won't."

---

# DAY 22 - APRIL 24, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **The Birthday**

---

## MORNING

The boy woke up shouting. Five years old.

Nobuyuki remembered five. He remembered being a child in an era when five meant survival was likely. He remembered watching generations of humans live and die while he aged slowly.

His son would age normally. Human lifespan, not Juraian. That was a gift and a loss.

---

The breakfast was absurd. Pancakes with a face. The stranger had created edible art.

Tenchi ate his own face and declared it delicious. The joy was pure, uncomplicated.

Nobuyuki allowed himself to feel it. Tomorrow he'd return to Kurashiki. Today, his son was five.

---

## AFTERNOON

Presents. Nobuyuki had brought the backpack, knowing Tenchi's love of robots.

His father presented a puzzle box. Nobuyuki recognized the craftsmanship immediately—the stranger had made it.

When had there been time? The joinery was perfect, the animals carved with professional skill.

"Grandpa said someone who cares about me made it."

Tenchi looked at the stranger. The man's face went soft in a way that couldn't be faked.

---

Then a small tanuki, also carved by hand.

"Maru. Because he's round."

The stranger laughed. It was a good sound. Whatever else this man was, he was capable of genuine warmth.

---

## EVENING

**SCENE 201-250 | Birthday Dinner**
The cake had five candles. Tenchi made a wish.

"What did you wish for?"

"Can't tell or it won't come true!"

The old superstition. Nobuyuki wondered what a five-year-old wished for. Toys? Adventures?

Looking at how Tenchi watched the adults at the table, he suspected the wish was simpler: that things would stay like this.

---

**SCENE 251-280 | "This Day Has Everyone"**
"This is the best day."

"Better than any other day?"

"This day has EVERYONE."

Everyone. His father, himself, the stranger. The boy's family, however oddly assembled.

Nobuyuki looked at the man who had somehow become part of that.

The silver flecks in his eyes caught the candlelight.

---

# DAY 23 - APRIL 25, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **Walking with Tenchi**

---

## MORNING

Tomorrow he would leave. Today belonged to his son.

They walked the mountain paths together. Tenchi pointed out everything: this tree, that rock, the place where a fox once appeared.

"Do you like living here?"

"Yes!"

"Even with your grandfather being so... traditional?"

Tenchi clearly didn't understand the word. "Grandpa is Grandpa."

Indeed. Seven hundred years of being Grandpa.

---

## AFTERNOON

"Do you like Sheldon-san?"

"He makes good food and he's nice and he has star-eyes."

"Star-eyes?"

"Little silver sparkles. Like the sky."

Nobuyuki's breath caught. His son, at five, had noticed what took an architect's trained eye to see.

"You're very observant."

"What's that mean?"

"You notice things."

"Is that good?"

"It's very good."

---

## EVENING

Last night on the mountain. Tomorrow, back to Kurashiki.

The stranger joined them for tea after Tenchi went to sleep.

"Thank you for making his birthday special."

"It was my honor."

"I'll be researching you," Nobuyuki said directly. "Background checks. Whatever I can find."

The stranger nodded. "I expected you would. I hope you find what you're looking for. I'd like to know too."

Either supreme confidence or genuine ignorance. Nobuyuki couldn't tell which was more unsettling.

---

# DAY 24 - APRIL 26, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## **Departure**

---

## MORNING

The car was packed. Tenchi clung to his leg.

"Will you come back?"

"Of course."

"When?"

"When work allows."

The boy's face fell. Work was the enemy, the thing that kept Papa away.

"But I'll write. And call."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

---

**SCENE 051-080 | Final Assessment**
Nobuyuki shook the stranger's hand one more time.

"Take care of them."

"I will."

No hesitation. No qualification. A promise delivered as fact.

Whatever this man was, he meant it.

---

**SCENE 081-100 | The Drive Down**
The mountain receded in the rearview mirror.

Nobuyuki had more questions than answers. The stranger's background would require investigation. The energy signature would require monitoring. The situation would require vigilance.

But his son was happy. His father was... as close to content as Yosho ever got.

Perhaps that was enough. For now.
