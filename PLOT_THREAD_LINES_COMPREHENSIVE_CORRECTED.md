| Original Claim | Correction | Impact on Story |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Yosho born ~300 CE | Born ~1262 CE (730 years old in early 1990s) | Age calculations; historical references |
| Tenchi's mother = Achika | OVA canon = **Kiyone Masaki** (Achika is Tenchi Universe only) | Family tree; grief references |
| Airi mother of Tennyo | Airi is Tennyo's **grandmother** (Kiyone's mother) | Masaki family structure |
| Kiyone Makibi exists | **Not in OVA canon** (Tenchi Universe only) | Cannot reference; different character |

Jurai, Juraian, Royal Tree, Galaxy Police, Phase I, Phase II,

## PART 18: CANON COMPLIANCE QUICK REFERENCE

### 18.1 Absolute Rules

1. **Tenchi's mother is Kiyone Masaki** â€” Never "Achika" (Tenchi Universe only)
2. **Kiyone Makibi does not exist** â€” Character is Tenchi Universe only
3. **Yosho is ~730 years old** â€” Not ~700, not ~1700
4. **Ryoko sealed until August 13, 2001** â€” Cannot physically appear before
5. **Masaki Shrine has 320 steps** â€” Based on Tarojinja
6. **Funaho is rooted** â€” Cannot take ship form; Yosho cannot leave Earth
7. **Nobuyuki was born 19th century** â€” Not 1955
8. **Elderly Yosho is illusion** â€” True form is ~30
