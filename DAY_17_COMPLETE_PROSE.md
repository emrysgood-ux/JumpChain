## SCENE 1: LAST SHRINE MORNING
**Time:** 05:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The seventeenth morning carried the weight of finality.

Sheldon woke before the uguisu, his internal clock now synchronized so precisely that the bird's call merely confirmed what his body already knew. The guest room's familiar shadows would be different shadows tomorrow—he would wake at the Tsukino house, in a room he'd visited but never inhabited.

The futon folded with motions that had become automatic. The clothes sorted into what would travel today versus what would remain here temporarily. Small decisions that organized a transition he'd known was coming but still felt slightly unreal.

Seventeen days. In the measure of a life, nothing. In the measure of this new existence, everything. He had arrived knowing nothing, speaking a language someone else had given him, carrying a history someone else had created. He would leave knowing... more. How much more remained unclear.

---

## SCENE 2: ONIGIRI LESSON
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Tenchi appeared as promised, dressed in clothes that suggested he'd been awake and waiting.

"I'm ready to learn."

The boy's seriousness bordered on comical—small hands washed without prompting, sleeves already pushed back, face set with the determination of someone approaching sacred instruction. Sheldon had promised to teach him to make onigiri. The promise apparently carried weight beyond its simple content.

"First: rice." Sheldon scooped warm rice from the cooker into a bowl. "The rice needs to be hot enough to stick but cool enough to handle. Too hot burns your hands. Too cold doesn't hold together."

"How do you know when it's right?"

"You test it." He offered a small spoonful. "Touch the back of your hand to the rice. It should feel warm but not painful."

Tenchi tested carefully, the gesture precise despite his age. "It's warm."

"Good. Now: salt." Sheldon demonstrated wetting his hands, rubbing salt between his palms. "The salt helps the rice not stick to you, and it flavors the outside of the ball."

"Why the outside?"

"Because that's what touches your tongue first. The center stays plain, so each bite has the salty outside mixing with the plain inside."

---

## SCENE 3: SHAPING
**Time:** 05:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The boy's first attempts produced lopsided results.

"It's not triangular."

"Triangle takes practice. Start with round." Sheldon demonstrated the hand motion—compression without crushing, rotation that distributed pressure evenly. "The shape comes from how you hold it, not how hard you press."

Tenchi tried again, small hands working the rice with concentration that suggested world-altering stakes. The second ball emerged rounder than the first, though still imperfect by professional standards.

"Better?"

"Much better. Another five hundred attempts and they'll be perfect."

"Five hundred?" The number clearly alarmed him.

"That's how skills work. The first attempt teaches you it's possible. The next hundred teach you the basics. The hundred after that teach you the refinements. Then you keep practicing until your hands know what to do without your mind having to help."

The explanation seemed to both reassure and overwhelm. Tenchi looked at his hands as if seeing them differently—instruments capable of learning things his mind couldn't consciously track.

"Your hands are good at this," Tenchi observed, watching Sheldon form another ball with casual efficiency.

"My hands have been practicing. Before long, yours will be good too."

---

## SCENE 4: BREAKFAST TOGETHER
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Katsuhito appeared to find breakfast already arranged.

Two misshapen onigiri occupied a place of honor beside the regular rice—Tenchi's contributions, presented with the pride of first creation. The priest examined them with the gravity the moment demanded.

"You made these?"

"Sheldon-san taught me." Tenchi bounced slightly, excitement overcoming his attempts at composure. "The first one is bad but the second one is better."

"The first one shows you began. The second shows you learned. Both are valuable." Katsuhito took the worse-shaped ball and bit into it. His expression remained neutral for a long moment—too long for Tenchi's patience.

"Is it okay?"

"The salt is well distributed. The compression is adequate. The shape will improve with practice." The priest finished the onigiri in two more bites. "A successful first lesson."

Sheldon watched the exchange, noting how Katsuhito's measured praise landed with Tenchi. The boy straightened, his confidence visibly reinforced. Teaching was one thing. Teaching well enough that the student wanted to continue—that was another skill entirely.

---

## SCENE 5: SCHOOL DEPARTURE
**Time:** 07:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

The morning goodbye carried additional weight.

"Five days until my birthday," Tenchi said. "And tomorrow you're at your house."

"Yes."

"But you'll come for my birthday."

"I'll come for your birthday. That promise hasn't changed."

The boy nodded, the information apparently satisfying whatever confirmation he'd sought. But he didn't immediately turn to go. Instead, he stood in the entrance, backpack secured, looking at Sheldon with an expression that suggested thoughts not yet translated into words.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you for the onigiri lesson."

"You're welcome."

"And for staying here. Even if it was only until your house got fixed." The words emerged with the careful precision of something rehearsed. "Grandfather says guests who become friends are better than guests who just leave."

The statement hit unexpectedly. Sheldon crouched to meet the boy's eyes. "Your grandfather is wise. And you're right—I'm not just leaving. I'm moving to a nearby place. That's different from leaving."

"I know. But I wanted to say it anyway."

"I'm glad you did."

---

## SCENE 6: FINAL WORK DAY
**Time:** 08:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

The bedroom had been transformed.

What had been a construction zone now presented itself as living space—tatami cleaned, walls wiped down, the accumulated dust of weeks removed. Yamada stood in the center, surveying work that had reached its intended conclusion.

"Habitable," he announced. "Not finished, but habitable. The remaining work proceeds around you rather than preventing you."

"What remains?"

"Cosmetic elements. The tokonoma needs refinement. Some shoji screens should be re-papered. The engawa requires attention at the southwest corner." He listed items with the precision of someone who had cataloged every remaining task. "Weeks of work, proceeding at whatever pace serves the house without disrupting its occupant."

Sheldon walked through the space, seeing it with new eyes. The room where Etsuko had slept for decades. The room where generations of Tsukinos had begun and ended their days. Tomorrow night, his room.

"I'll bring my things tomorrow afternoon."

"I'll have Takeshi help carry what needs carrying. The path is clear enough, but two people manage awkward loads better than one."

---

## SCENE 7: KITCHEN INSPECTION
**Time:** 09:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

The kitchen revealed itself as functional but sparse.

Gas stove: working, tested multiple times. Water: flowing from the pump, clean enough for use. Storage: empty cabinets waiting for contents. The infrastructure existed; the life that would fill it remained absent.

"You'll want to stock gradually," Yamada advised. "Don't buy everything at once. Learn what you need through use. The village store has most essentials; specialty items require trips to Kurashiki."

"How often do people go to Kurashiki?"

"Monthly, usually. The bus runs daily, but most villagers group errands." The carpenter opened a cabinet to demonstrate its function. "Some things—tools, building materials, fabric—require the city. Food, basic goods, daily needs—the village provides."

The self-sufficiency of rural life wasn't total, Sheldon noted. The village existed in relationship with larger centers, dependent on connection while maintaining its separateness. Like organs in a body—distinct but not isolated.

---

## SCENE 8: AFTERNOON ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 14:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Takeshi had completed the drainage modifications.

"The water that caused the original damage—it followed paths determined by ground slope and foundation position." The nephew walked Sheldon through the changes: new channels cut into earth, gravel beds providing redirection, strategic plantings that would absorb rather than channel future moisture.

"Will this prevent future problems?"

"It will reduce them. Nothing prevents all problems—water finds paths humans don't anticipate. But we've addressed the known paths. Future issues will be new issues, not repetitions of old ones."

The philosophy aligned with what Sheldon was learning about Japanese craftsmanship: acknowledge what can be controlled, prepare for what might happen, accept that some uncertainties remained beyond preparation.

"Thank you for thinking ahead."

"Ahead is easier than fixing behind." Takeshi collected his tools. "Uncle says you move in tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow afternoon."

"Good. Empty houses deteriorate faster than occupied ones. Your presence will help the repair hold."

---

## SCENE 9: RETURN TO SHRINE
**Time:** 16:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and shrine

The ascent carried the quality of both routine and farewell.

Tomorrow this walk would begin from the house rather than end at it. The 320 steps would still be there, but his relationship to them would change—no longer the path home, but the path to where he'd been welcomed. The distinction mattered even if the steps remained identical.

He paused at the halfway point, looking down at the house that would be his tomorrow. From this elevation, the repairs were invisible—the building presented itself as it had for decades, traditional roof line, weathered walls, the composed presence of a structure that had served its purpose faithfully.

Etsuko had walked this path. Her father before her. Generations of Tsukinos ascending and descending between the family property and the shrine that presided over the valley. Tomorrow, he would join that line—not by blood, but by presence. Not by natural inheritance, but by the strange gift of a benefactor who had given him a history he'd never lived.

---

## SCENE 10: TRANSITION DINNER PREPARATION
**Time:** 17:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Katsuhito had insisted on cooking.

"You've prepared meals for this household for two weeks. Tonight, I prepare a meal for you." The priest's voice carried the particular formality of ritual. "Sit. Watch if you wish. But do not help."

The prohibition felt strange after days of participation. Sheldon seated himself at the kitchen table, observing hands that moved with even greater efficiency than his own. The priest's cooking was not merely competent—it was practiced to the point of art, each gesture containing decades of repetition.

"You cook differently than you taught me."

"I taught you foundations. What you're watching now is the building that sits on those foundations." Katsuhito selected vegetables with speed that suggested instant assessment. "You could reach this level. The question is whether you want to invest the years it requires."

"Do you think I should?"

"I think you should invest years in something. Whether cooking serves that purpose depends on who you're becoming, not who you were."

---

## SCENE 11: TENCHI'S CONTRIBUTION
**Time:** 17:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The boy appeared with an offering.

"I made something." He presented a folded paper construction—rough-edged, asymmetrical, clearly produced by small hands working at the limits of their coordination. "It's a bird. For Sheldon-san's new house."

The origami was more concept than execution. But the intention radiated from Tenchi's earnest expression, the gift's value residing entirely in its making rather than its form.

"Thank you." Sheldon accepted the paper bird with the gravity it deserved. "It will go in the tokonoma, once I've prepared that alcove."

"Really?"

"Really. The first decoration in my new house will be something you made."

The promise landed with visible impact. Tenchi's face shifted through several emotions—surprise, pleasure, something that might have been pride. "I can make more. Better ones. Once I practice."

"Practice always helps. But this one has value because it was first. Later birds might be more skilled, but this one will always be the one you gave me when I moved in."

---

## SCENE 12: THE MEAL
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

The dinner exceeded daily fare.

Not by dramatic measure—the ingredients were similar, the basic structure unchanged. But the preparation showed a level of attention that normal meals didn't receive. Rice cooked to precise consistency. Vegetables arranged with compositional awareness. Fish that had been scored for even cooking, presented with the elegance of intention.

"A transition meal," Katsuhito explained. "The food marks the moment. We remember meals at significant points—first visit, last visit, celebrations, mourning. Tonight becomes a marker."

"A marker for what?"

"For when you were part of this household, and then became something else." The priest served himself last, following the hierarchy that had governed every meal. "Not a lesser thing—a different thing. The relationship continues, but the daily form changes."

Tenchi ate with less commentary than usual, perhaps sensing the moment's weight. His eyes moved between the adults, reading currents he couldn't name but clearly detected.

"It's good," the boy offered finally. "The fish is better than normal fish."

"Thank you, Tenchi. I made it with extra care."

---

## SCENE 13: AFTER-DINNER REFLECTION
**Time:** 19:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

They sat watching the last light fade from the mountains.

Sheldon, Katsuhito, Tenchi in a row on the engawa, each processing the evening's significance according to their own understanding. The view that had greeted Sheldon's first evening at the shrine spread before them—unchanged, indifferent to the human transition occurring in its presence.

"I'll visit often," Sheldon said, addressing neither adult nor child specifically.

"You'll visit when it's natural to visit," Katsuhito replied. "Forced visits serve no one. Natural visits strengthen connection. Let the visits happen rather than making them happen."

The distinction felt important. The priest wasn't asking for regular appearances—he was asking for genuine presence when genuine presence made sense. Obligation without forced schedule. Relationship without artificial maintenance.

"How will I know when it's natural?"

"You'll feel an inclination. A thought of us that leads to your feet walking this direction. Don't analyze it. Just act when the impulse arrives."

---

## SCENE 14: BATH RITUAL
**Time:** 20:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bath area

The final guest bath.

Tomorrow, if the Tsukino house's bath functioned, Sheldon would begin establishing new patterns in a different tub. Tonight, he soaked in water that would be used by Katsuhito and then by Tenchi—the hierarchy that had governed his days here operating one more time.

The heat worked through muscles tired from work but not exhausted. He'd grown stronger over these weeks, or perhaps simply discovered strength that had always been present. His body functioned now as a tool he could rely on, its limits expanded beyond what he'd previously assumed.

*What will I miss?* he asked himself. The question had answers: the morning routine with Katsuhito, the evening conversations, Tenchi's daily stories, the particular quality of belonging that came from sleeping under someone else's roof with their explicit welcome.

*What will I gain?* That question had different answers: independence, ownership, the responsibility that came with having something that was truly his to maintain.

Both sets of answers were real. Both sets of consequences would follow.

---

## SCENE 15: EVENING PACKING
**Time:** 21:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The possessions that would travel fit in two bags.

The construction notes, now extensive. The photographs from Uncle Kiyoshi. The language texts on loan—those would stay, to be returned at future visits. The clothes that had accumulated: work garments, the daily wear Katsuhito had provided, the few items that had survived from his original appearance.

Tenchi's paper bird sat on the desk, too fragile for packing but essential to bring. Sheldon would carry it separately, protecting the gift that would become his first decoration.

The room looked strange with his things gathered rather than distributed. Emptier, but also ready for what came after him. Guest rooms existed to be temporarily occupied—their nature required departure as much as arrival.

---

## SCENE 16: FINAL GOODNIGHT
**Time:** 21:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, hallway

Katsuhito met him in the hallway, moving toward his own room.

"Sleep well. Tomorrow begins a new chapter."

"Thank you. For everything."

"Thanks for staying are not necessary. Thanks for the man you became while staying—that, you can thank me for, though the becoming was yours to do." The priest's eyes held something Sheldon couldn't quite read. "You arrived as a stranger with a strange story. You're leaving as someone I will be pleased to welcome back."

"I didn't know what to expect when I climbed those steps the first time."

"No one ever does. That's why the steps exist—to give the expectant something to do while they wait for arrival to reveal itself." A slight smile. "Tomorrow, climb them again. You'll find they feel different when you're ascending toward welcome rather than uncertainty."

---

## SCENE 17: LAST NIGHT
**Time:** 22:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Sleep refused to arrive immediately.

Sheldon lay on the futon that would be someone else's futon by tomorrow, in a room that would return to its waiting state, listening to the sounds that had become background to his nights. The shrine settling. Wind through trees. The distant presence of the forest and all it contained.

Seventeen days. The number felt simultaneously long and short—long enough to establish routines, short enough that those routines still felt new. He had become a person here, or perhaps recognized a person he'd always been. The distinction mattered less than the fact.

Tomorrow he would wake in this room one final time. Pack the remaining items. Walk to the house. Begin something else.

The transitions never stopped, he realized. One led to another led to another. The trick wasn't reaching a stable state—there was no stable state. The trick was learning to move through instability with something like grace.

*Rest*, the dream-voice would say if he could hear her. *Tomorrow requires you ready.*

He followed the advice before it was given.
