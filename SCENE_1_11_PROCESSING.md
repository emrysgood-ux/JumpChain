## SCENE 1.11: PROCESSING

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:30 JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The ceiling was made of wooden slats, each one fitted precisely against its neighbors.

Sheldon lay in the darkness and counted them. An old habit—his mind needed something to do while it sorted through the day's data, and counting gave it a task that didn't require real attention. Twelve slats across. Five sections visible from where he lay. Sixty slats total, give or take a few hidden by shadow.

*Facts,* grandmother's voice said. *Start with facts.*

He had them. He had more facts than he knew what to do with.

---

Fact: He had died.

The memory was clear—clearer than anything else, actually. The laboratory in Alaska. The particle accelerator, humming with energy that had taken months to accumulate. The cascade failure that had begun as a whisper and ended as a scream.

Maria Chen's face through the observation window.

He had worked with Maria for two years. She was brilliant—one of the best experimental physicists of her generation—and she had trusted him with calculations that would determine whether their work succeeded or failed. In the end, the calculations had been correct. The failure had come from somewhere else—a component that should have held and didn't, a stress fracture invisible to every inspection.

He had seen her eyes when she realized what was happening. The horror. The helplessness. The love she had never spoken and he had never acknowledged.

*Oh.*

That had been his last thought. Not regret for the work left undone, not fear of what came next. Just a small, quiet recognition that the story was ending.

And then it hadn't.

---

Fact: He was alive.

Not just alive—more alive than he had ever been. His body worked in ways it hadn't worked for years. Decades, maybe. The chronic aches were gone. The limitations he'd learned to navigate around had vanished. He could climb three hundred twenty steps without breathing hard. He could sit in seiza for an hour without his legs going numb.

Someone had fixed him. Rebuilt him. Made him into a better version of the person he'd been.

*Who?*

The question had no answer. Or rather, it had too many possible answers, each more impossible than the last. Divine intervention. Advanced technology. Some kind of dream from which he would eventually wake.

But the futon was real beneath him. The air was real in his lungs. The hunger he'd felt before dinner and the satisfaction he felt now—those were real too. Dreams didn't work this way. Dreams didn't have this kind of consistency, this attention to detail.

This wasn't a dream.

---

Fact: He was in Japan.

Okayama Prefecture, specifically. A mountain shrine with three hundred twenty steps and an old priest who spoke in riddles and a child who had named him brother. A house that apparently belonged to his family—a family he didn't remember having, whose documents sat in his wallet, whose history stretched back generations.

Tsukino Sheldon. Born March 15, 1959. Address in Okayama. Bank accounts with money he'd never earned. A family registry that traced his lineage through parents and grandparents he had no memory of.

Someone had created an identity for him. Not just a body—an entire life. A history. A place in the world.

*Why?*

Another question without an answer. Another mystery to add to the pile.

---

He turned on his side, pulling the comforter tighter.

The facts weren't enough. They never were, really—facts were the raw material of understanding, not understanding itself. A physicist knew this better than most. You could measure a phenomenon perfectly and still have no idea why it happened. The universe didn't owe explanations to the people who observed it.

But grandmother had taught him something else. Something that came before facts, before analysis, before the careful construction of theories.

*When you don't know what to do, do what's in front of you.*

What was in front of him: a bed. A room. A promise to a child that he would be there tomorrow.

He couldn't explain why he was here. He couldn't trace the chain of causation that had led from a laboratory in Alaska to a futon in Japan. But he could keep the promise. He could be there when Tenchi woke up.

*That's something,* he thought. *That's a start.*

The ceiling slats blurred slightly as his eyes began to close. Twelve across. Five sections. Sixty slats total.

Tomorrow would bring more facts. More questions. More of this impossible life that he somehow had to learn to live.

But for now—for this moment—he had a place to sleep. A roof over his head. People who had welcomed him without asking why.

That was enough.
