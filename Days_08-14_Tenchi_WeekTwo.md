# DAY 8 - APRIL 10, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **New Week Starts**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes, child-length)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

Monday again. School again. But the mornings had changed.

Sheldon-san's breakfast was waiting. The rice perfect, the eggs rolled, the soup steaming.

"You're awake early."

"I like mornings here."

"Why?"

"They're quiet. The mountain wakes up slowly."

---

Tenchi thought about that while eating. The mountain waking up. Like it was sleeping and then not sleeping.

"Do mountains dream?"

The interesting-question pause. Longer this time.

"I don't know. But if they did, this would be a good mountain for dreaming."

---

## SCHOOL (Scenes 101-150)

The other children talked about their weekends. Trips to the city. Visits from cousins. Normal family things.

Tenchi talked about the garden. About seeds and soil and the sick house.

"You have a strange family," Haruki said.

"It's not strange. It's just different."

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-220)

The steps felt shorter today. Like his legs were growing or the mountain was shrinking.

Sheldon-san was at the top, but today he was carrying wood.

"What's that for?"

"The cart wheel. The metal part is fixed. Now the wood needs attention."

"Can I watch?"

"You can help."

---

The woodwork was interesting. Sheldon-san's hands moved like they knew what they were doing, but his face looked surprised sometimes. Like his hands were teaching him instead of the other way around.

"How do you know how to do this?"

"I don't know. My hands seem to remember."

"Remember what?"

"Things I never learned."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 221-299)

Dinner included vegetables from the garden. Not the new seeds—those were still sleeping underground. Old vegetables from before Sheldon-san came.

"The garden was already planted?"

"By Masaru-san. The man who lived in the house."

"Where is he now?"

Another pause. A sad one.

"He's gone. Like your mama."

---

Tenchi thought about that. The man and the mama, both gone. The house sick because no one was taking care of it.

"Will you take care of his house?"

"I'm going to try."

"Good."

---

**Day 8 Summary:**
- Routine solidifying
- Philosophy discussions continuing
- Woodwork introduced
- Death concept touched (Masaru)
- Caretaking mission understood

---

# DAY 9 - APRIL 11, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **The Garden Sprouts**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

Something green was coming up in the garden.

"LOOK!"

Sheldon-san came running. Not scary running—excited running. Like he wanted to see too.

"You're right. They're sprouting."

"I planted those!"

"You did. And they're growing."

---

The small green things were barely there. Just tiny leaves pushing through dirt. But Tenchi had put the seeds in that exact spot. Had covered them with his own hands.

"They're mine."

"They're theirs. But you helped them start."

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-220)

School was impossible to focus on. The sprouts were at home, growing, and Tenchi was here learning about numbers.

"Five plus three?"

"Eight. Can I go home now?"

"It's not time yet, Tenchi-kun."

---

The walk up the steps was the fastest ever. Tenchi ran the last hundred, legs burning, breath ragged.

The sprouts were still there. Still growing. They hadn't disappeared while he was gone.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 221-299)

"They'll keep growing," Sheldon-san promised. "Every day a little more."

"How big?"

"Depends on what they are. Some will stay small. Some will get taller than you."

"Taller than me?"

"By summer."

---

Tenchi fell asleep thinking about plants taller than him. Plants he had helped start. Things that would exist because he had put seeds in dirt and covered them gently.

---

**Day 9 Summary:**
- First sprouts discovered
- Ownership/participation pride
- Growth anticipation established

---

# DAYS 10-14 - APRIL 12-16, 1989 (WED-SUN)
## **Second Week Continues**

---

### COMBINED SCENE SUMMARY (1,495 scenes condensed)

## MIDWEEK (Days 10-12)

The sprouts grew every day. Not visibly—Tenchi checked—but Sheldon-san said they were growing anyway.

"Too slow to see. But fast enough to measure."

"How do you measure growing?"

"Patience. And looking carefully."

---

The cart wheel was fixed. Sheldon-san showed him how it worked—the metal part spinning smoothly, the wood part holding it in place.

"Now we can carry heavy things."

"What heavy things?"

"Whatever the house needs. Whatever the garden needs. Whatever we find that should be moved."

---

School continued its rhythm. Learn, play, eat, rest, learn more. But every afternoon, the steps home felt less long. The person at the top felt more like he belonged there.

"You're always here."

"I like it here."

"Me too."

---

## WEEKEND (Days 13-14)

Saturday brought rain. The garden drank it. Sheldon-san stood on the engawa watching the water fall.

"Don't you want to go inside?"

"I like watching rain."

"Why?"

"It changes everything without trying. The world looks different after."

---

Tenchi stood with him. The rain made sounds on the leaves, on the stones, on the roof above them.

"It's loud."

"It's busy. Every drop has somewhere to go."

"Where do they go?"

"Down. Into the ground, into the streams, eventually to the ocean. Then back up into clouds. Then down again."

"Forever?"

"Forever."

---

Sunday was dry. The garden looked different—greener, fuller, more awake.

"The rain did that."

"The rain and the growing. Working together."

---

The sick house got attention. Sheldon-san was up on the roof, looking at broken pieces. Tenchi watched from below, worried.

"Be careful!"

"I'm being careful. Thank you for watching."

---

The watching felt important. Like if Tenchi stopped watching, something bad might happen. But nothing bad happened. Sheldon-san came down safe, covered in dust but smiling.

"The roof needs work. But it can be fixed."

"Can you fix it?"

"Some of it. The hard parts need help."

"I'll help!"

"You already do. More than you know."
