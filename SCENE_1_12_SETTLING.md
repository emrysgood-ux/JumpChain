## SCENE 1.12: SETTLING

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:45 JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

Somewhere outside, an owl called.

The sound was soft, muffled by distance and walls, but it reached Sheldon through the settling silence of the room. A low hoot, repeated once, then fading into the night. The owl was hunting, probably. Doing what owls did, regardless of the impossible things happening in the human world.

He thought about the owl. The way it existed without questions. The way it moved through its life following instincts that had served its ancestors for millennia.

*Must be nice,* he thought, and almost smiled.

---

The tears came without warning.

One moment he was lying still, his body heavy with exhaustion, his mind finally beginning to quiet. The next moment his eyes were burning and his throat was tight and something was breaking loose inside his chest that he hadn't known was held there.

He didn't sob. The tears simply fell—sliding down his temples, soaking into the pillow beneath his head. Silent. Steady. The accumulated pressure of a day that had demanded too much releasing itself in the only way his body knew how.

*I died.*

The thought arrived with the tears, and this time he didn't push it away. He let it sit. Let it be true.

He had died. In a laboratory in Alaska, surrounded by equipment he'd spent years learning to use, watched by a woman who had loved him without ever saying so. His heart had stopped. His lungs had emptied. The electrical activity in his brain had ceased, and for some unmeasurable span of time, Sheldon Carter had not existed.

And then he had woken up in a field with grass against his cheek and a new name and a body that didn't hurt.

*Why?*

He didn't know. Might never know. But lying here in the darkness, tears cooling on his skin, he felt something shift—some barrier inside himself that had been holding since the moment he opened his eyes.

He was alive. Against all logic, against all expectation, against everything he thought he understood about how the universe worked—he was alive. And that was terrifying. And that was a miracle. And those two things could both be true at the same time.

*Thank you.*

The words formed in his mind without a specific recipient. Thank you to whoever had done this. Thank you to whatever force had seen fit to give him another chance. Thank you to his grandmother, who had taught him to keep moving when everything fell apart. Thank you to the owl, still hunting in the darkness. Thank you to the pillow absorbing his tears.

Thank you.

---

Sleep came in stages.

First the heaviness in his limbs, spreading from his feet upward like warm water filling a vessel. Then the softening of his thoughts, the edges blurring, the sharp questions dissolving into shapeless wondering. Then the darkness behind his eyes deepening, becoming not the absence of light but something more active—a presence, a destination.

He thought of Tenchi's face. The serious eyes. The nickname that had settled on him like a gift he hadn't known he wanted.

*Sheru-nii.*

He thought of Katsuhito's smile. The riddles. The tea served without questions.

*The mountain accepted you.*

He thought of the stairs. The tree. The kitchen. The fish. The stars.

He thought of nothing.

And then, finally, mercifully, he slept.
