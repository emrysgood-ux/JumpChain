## YEAR 14 TIMELINE

### Spring (April - June 2002)

**Household Status:**
- Post-Kagato stability
- Washu settling in
- Tenchi turns 18
- School continuing

**Key Developments:**

| Month | Event | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| April | Tenchi's 18th birthday | Coming of age |
| April | Washu's lab fully operational | Subspace established |
| May | Washu begins "research" on Tenchi | Canon behavior |
| June | Washu begins investigating Sheldon | Our addition |

### Summer (July - September 2002)

**Washu's Investigation of Sheldon — Phase 1**

| Week | Action | Finding |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Passive scans | Anomalous energy signature |
| 2 | Historical research | No records before 1989 |
| 3 | Genetic analysis (covert) | Human DNA, no modifications |
| 4 | Dimensional resonance test | External origin confirmed |
| 5 | Comparison to known entities | No match in database |
| 6 | Hypothesis formation | "Someone else's work" |

**Washu's Hypotheses:**

| # | Theory | Evidence For | Evidence Against |
|---|--------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | Hidden Juraian | Energy signature | Wrong frequency |
| 2 | Dimensional traveler | External origin | Too stable |
| 3 | Another god's creation | Divine signature | Unknown god |
| 4 | Natural anomaly | Unique signature | Too specific |
| 5 | Experiment subject | Modified human | No modifications |

**Washu's Conclusion (Provisional):**
> "Subject was placed here by an entity operating outside my sisters' framework. The signature suggests divine origin but from a source I cannot identify. This predates my mortal existence but not my goddess memories — which means either this entity is younger than me, or it operates in a dimension I never catalogued. Either possibility is... fascinating."

**Washu's Decision:**
- Continue observation
- Do NOT confront yet
- Do NOT alert sisters (they're not reunited)
- File under "long-term research"
- Prioritize Tenchi (her primary interest)

### Fall (October - December 2002)

**Sasami/Tsunami Revelation Arc**

**Trigger:** Sasami's nightmares about assimilation increase

**Canon Events Preserved:**

| Event | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Sasami's distress | She fears rejection |
| Tsunami's presence felt | Household senses something |
| Sasami confesses | Reveals her secret |
| Household accepts | Universal acceptance |
| Tsunami appears (vision) | First direct goddess contact |

**Our Version Additions:**

| Addition | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Sheldon's calm acceptance | Models response |
| Washu's hidden recognition | She knows what Tsunami is |
| Yosho's knowledge | He's met Tsunami (Jurai history) |
| Deeper comfort scene | Sheldon with Sasami |

**Key Scene: Sasami's Confession**

*Canon:* Sasami fears everyone will reject her when they learn she's merged with a goddess.

*Our Version:*
- Sasami confesses to household
- Everyone accepts (as in canon)
- **Sheldon's response:** "You're still Sasami. What's inside you doesn't change who you've become."
- This resonates because Sheldon has his own hidden nature
- Parallel established (both carrying something cosmic within)

**Washu's Private Realization:**

After Tsunami revelation, Washu thinks:
> "So my sister has been watching this household through Sasami all along. And she never mentioned the anomaly in the kitchen. Either she doesn't know... or she's choosing not to tell me. Interesting."

### Winter (January - March 2003)

**Stabilization Period**

| Development | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Sasami accepted | Full integration |
| Washu's investigation | Ongoing, low priority |
| Household routine | Stable |
| Sheldon's role | Unchanged, essential |

## YEAR 15 TIMELINE

### Spring-Summer (April - September 2003)

**Pre-Arc Calm**

Normal household life. Key character positions:

| Character | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Tenchi | 19, training | Stronger |
| Washu | Researching | Multiple projects |
| Ryoko | Integrated | Aunt role developing |
| Ayeka | Integrated | Princess aunt |
| Sasami | Accepted | At peace |
| Mihoshi | Present | Comic relief |
| Sheldon | Central | Everyone's anchor |
| Yosho | Watching | Planning next phase |

### Fall (October - December 2003)

**Dr. Clay Arc Begins**

**Behind the Scenes (Unknown to Household):**

| Event | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Tokimi contacts Dr. Clay | Higher dimension | Orders: Capture Washu |
| Clay accepts mission | His ship | Fears Tokimi |
| Clay creates Zero | His ship | Perfect copy ability |
| Zero sent to Earth | Transit | Mission: Replace Ryoko |

**Day 1: Infiltration Begins**

| Event | Canon | Our Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Zero intercepts Ryoko | Same | Same |
| Zero copies Ryoko perfectly | Same | Same |
| Zero takes Ryoko's gem | Same | Same |
| Zero enters household | Same | Same |
| Zero acts as Ryoko | Same | Same |

**The Infiltration Period (Days 1-7)**

| Day | Zero's Challenge | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------|
| 1 | Learn household rhythms | She has Ryoko's memories |
| 2 | Interact with Tenchi | Feelings develop |
| 3 | Interact with others | Sasami notices something? |
| 4 | Sheldon interaction | **Our addition** |
| 5 | Feelings intensify | Can't complete mission |
| 6 | Clay demands action | Zero resists |
| 7 | Washu discovers truth | Dr. Clay's mark |

**Our Addition: Zero Meets Sheldon**

Zero has Ryoko's memories, including 12 years of observing Sheldon. But:
- Memories vs. experience differ
- Zero's emotional response to Sheldon is copied from Ryoko
- She finds him... comforting? Confusing?
- This adds to her inability to complete mission

**Key Scene: Zero in the Kitchen**

*Setting:* Early morning, Zero can't sleep (robots don't need to, but she's playing Ryoko)

*Sheldon is cooking*

Zero watches him from the doorway. Ryoko's memories tell her this man is important, that watching him cook was one of the few comforts during 700 years of imprisonment. But Zero is experiencing it fresh.

> ZERO (as Ryoko): "You're up early."
> SHELDON: "Always am. Coffee?"
> ZERO: "...yes."

She accepts. Studies him. Ryoko's memories say he's an anomaly, something neither demon nor human, but kind.

> SHELDON: "You seem different this morning."
> ZERO: "Different how?"
> SHELDON: "Quieter. More... observant."

Zero realizes he notices things. Files this as useful data. But also feels something she can't categorize.

**This scene:**
- Shows Zero's infiltration skills
- Establishes Sheldon notices behavioral changes
- Plants seed of "something's different"
- Doesn't lead to early detection (canon preserved)

**Detection Scene (Canon Preserved)**

Washu detects Zero via Dr. Clay's logo during bath scene. This remains the detection method.

| Element | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| Bath scene | Washu sees mark |
| Physical detection | Not power-based |
| Canon preserved | Same mechanism |

**The Confrontation and Resolution**

| Event | Canon | Our Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Zero exposed | Same | Same |
| Zero refuses to kill Tenchi | Same | Same |
| Battle on Clay's ship | Same | Same |
| Tenchi uses LHW barrier | Same | Same |
| Clay defeated | Same | Same |
| Zero merges with Ryoko | Same | Same |
| Tokimi revealed (then erased) | Same | Same |

**Post-Arc Changes:**

| Change | Canon | Our Version |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Ryoko more honest (Zero merge) | Same | Same |
| Memory of Tokimi erased | Same | Same |
| Washu knows something higher exists | Same | Same |
| Household returns to normal | Same | Same |

**Washu's Updated Assessment:**

After the Zero arc, Washu knows:
1. Tokimi (her sister) is active
2. Someone higher than her exists
3. Her investigation of Sheldon continues separately
4. She does NOT connect Sheldon to Tokimi/Chousin

| Sheldon's first Jurai exposure | Meets royalty |

**Key Scene: Funaho Meets Sheldon**

*Funaho*, First Queen of Jurai, is Earth-born. She would be curious about another Earth human in this household.

> FUNAHO: "You've been here for many years, I'm told."
> SHELDON: "Twelve years now."
> FUNAHO: "And my son has... accepted you."
> SHELDON: "Yosho accepted me, yes."
> FUNAHO: (pause) "You call him Yosho. Not Katsuhito."
> SHELDON: "He told me his name."
> FUNAHO: "He trusts you."
> SHELDON: "I hope so."

## YEAR 17 TIMELINE

### The Z Arc (Spring 2005)

**Day 1: Z Attacks**

| Event | Canon | Our Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Z appears | Same | Same |
| Devastating power (5 LHW) | Same | Same |
| Household mobilizes | Same | Faster coordination |
| Tenchi confronts | Same | Same |
| Tenchi nearly killed | Same | Same |

**THE TURNING POINT:**

When Tenchi is nearly killed, Washu has no choice. She resumes her goddess form.

| Event | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Washu-kami-sama awakens | Memories restored |
| Tsunami acts through Sasami | Two goddesses active |
| Tokimi observes | Three sisters aware |

**CRITICAL NEW ELEMENT:**

When Washu's divine senses return, she FINALLY perceives Sheldon clearly.

**Washu's Divine Perception of Sheldon:**

> The mortal part of me had noted the anomaly for years. But now, with my full senses restored, I see him truly.
>
> He burns with light that isn't Light Hawk. It's... something else. Something from OUTSIDE. Not from Tokimi's chaos experiments. Not from Tsunami's life weaving. Not from my own science.
>
> Another goddess's fingerprints are on this man.
>
> But whose?

**Washu's Decision (In Crisis):**
- File for later
- Tenchi is priority
- Z must be stopped
- Sheldon is not a threat
- Investigate after survival

### The Counter-Actor Crisis

| Event | Canon | Our Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Reality destabilizes | Same | Same |
| Counter-Actor emerges | Same | Same |
| Future Misaki threat | Same | Same |
| Kami Tenchi manifests | **PRESERVED** | Same |
| 6+ Light Hawk Wings | Same | Same |
| Reality restored | Same | Same |

**KAMI TENCHI — Fixed Point**

Tenchi's manifestation as the being above the Chousin is a FIXED POINT. This is the culmination of their trillion-year experiment. Nothing about Sheldon's presence changes this.

### Post-Crisis: The Reunion

**Chousin Reunited:**
- Washu-kami-sama (now aware)
- Tsunami-kami-sama (through Sasami)
- Tokimi-kami-sama (joins household as "Toki-chan")

**The Discussion They DON'T Have On-Page:**

After the crisis, the three sisters would naturally discuss everything. Including:

> WASHU: "You've noticed him too."
> TSUNAMI: "The one who cooks? Yes. For twelve years through Sasami."
> TOKIMI: "His signature is... unfamiliar."
> WASHU: "Another goddess. Not us. Not the Counter-Actor. Someone else."
> TSUNAMI: "Should we investigate?"
> WASHU: "He's done nothing harmful. He's been... helpful, actually."
> TOKIMI: "The experiment succeeded. Tenchi is the one we sought."
> WASHU: "Yes. The anomaly in the kitchen can wait."
> TSUNAMI: "Perhaps indefinitely. He seems content to simply... be family."

**Their Conclusion:**
- Sheldon is noticed
- Sheldon is not investigated aggressively
- Sheldon is not their priority
- Tenchi remains the focus
- Cosmos remains unidentified

### Year 17 Ends

**Household Status Post-Z:**

| Character | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Tenchi | Kami Tenchi confirmed |
| Washu | Goddess form accessible |
| Tsunami/Sasami | Fully merged path clear |
| Tokimi | Joins household (Toki-chan) |
| Ryoko | Family, no longer "demon" |
| Ayeka | Family, political heir |
| Mihoshi | Family, GP liaison |
| Noike | Family, spy mission over |
| Sheldon | **Noticed but not confronted** |
| Yosho | Patriarch, revealed prince |
