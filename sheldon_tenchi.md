# SHELDON × TENCHI
## Relationship Progression
### Son of Cosmos: JumpChain

---

## OVERVIEW

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Parental/uncle bond |
| **Starting Point** | Tenchi age 4, Sheldon body-age 22 |
| **Dynamic** | Chosen family, daily presence |
| **Function** | Transforms Tenchi's emotional foundation |

---

## THE CORE DYNAMIC

Sheldon is NOT Tenchi's father. Nobuyuki is.

Sheldon is the uncle who's always there—the one who cooks breakfast, helps with homework, listens to problems, provides stability. He fills the gap left by Nobuyuki's absence and Kiyone's death.

**What Tenchi Lost:** His mother (age 3-4)
**What Tenchi Gained:** An uncle who shows love through presence

---

## YEAR 1: FIRST MEETING (Age 4-5)

### Day 2: Initial Contact
- Tenchi curious about stranger
- Sheldon gentle, non-threatening
- Immediate comfort (Lambda influence? Natural rapport?)
- "Sheru-ji" nickname emerges within days

### What Tenchi Sees
- A grown-up who pays attention
- Someone who cooks amazing food
- A person who doesn't leave on Monday
- Not a replacement mom, but... something

### What Sheldon Sees
- A grieving child pretending to be okay
- Enormous potential (sensed, not understood)
- Someone who needs consistency
- A reason to stay

### Key Moments (Year 1)
| Day | Event |
|-----|-------|
| 2 | First meeting; Tenchi hides behind Katsuhito |
| 5 | First meal together; Tenchi asks for seconds |
| 12 | "Sheru-ji" used for first time |
| 22 | Tenchi's 5th birthday; Sheldon bakes cake |
| 45 | Tenchi asks Sheldon to read bedtime story |
| 100 | Tenchi cries about mom; Sheldon just holds him |

---

## YEARS 2-5: FOUNDATION (Ages 5-9)

### Daily Routine Established
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Morning | Sheldon makes breakfast |
| School hours | Sheldon at Tsukino house or helping shrine |
| Afternoon | Tenchi returns; snack, homework help |
| Evening | Dinner together (with Katsuhito) |
| Bedtime | Stories, sometimes from Sheldon |

### What Tenchi Learns from Sheldon
- Cooking basics (standing on stool to help)
- That men can nurture
- That grief is okay to feel
- That family is who stays

### Milestone Moments
| Year | Age | Event |
|------|-----|-------|
| 2 | 6 | Tenchi starts elementary school; Sheldon walks him |
| 3 | 7 | First time Tenchi defends Sheldon to classmate ("He's my uncle!") |
| 4 | 8 | Tenchi asks why Sheldon doesn't have kids of his own |
| 5 | 9 | Tenchi realizes Sheldon isn't "normal" (too good at everything) |

---

## YEARS 6-9: DEEPENING (Ages 10-13)

### Pre-Adolescent Shift
Tenchi becomes more independent but the bond remains. He starts asking harder questions.

### Questions Tenchi Asks
| Age | Question | Sheldon's Answer |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| 10 | "Why did you come here?" | "I was lost. Your grandfather found me." |
| 11 | "Do you miss your family?" | "Every day. But I have family here too." |
| 12 | "Are you going to leave?" | "Not unless you want me to." |
| 13 | "What's really in that cave?" | "Something your grandfather guards. Trust him." |

### What Changes
- Tenchi confides in Sheldon about school, crushes, fears
- Sheldon becomes the "safe" adult to talk to
- Katsuhito handles training; Sheldon handles emotions
- The divide is unspoken but clear

---

## YEARS 10-12: PRE-CANON (Ages 14-16)

### Adolescence
Tenchi pulls away (normal) but always comes back (the foundation holds).

### The Dynamic Now
| Nobuyuki | Sheldon | Katsuhito |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Money, legal stuff | Emotional support | Training, secrets |
| Weekend visits | Daily presence | Daily presence |
| Awkward talks | Real talks | Cryptic wisdom |

### Tenchi's Awareness
- Knows Sheldon and Grandfather have "something"
- Doesn't have words for it yet
- Accepts it without question
- More worried about his own life

### Pre-Canon Anxiety
Tenchi feels drawn to the cave. Sheldon notices but doesn't interfere—this isn't his story to change.

---

## YEAR 13: CANON BEGINS (Age 17)

### The Release
Tenchi enters the cave. Releases Ryoko. Everything changes.

### Sheldon's Role During Canon
- NOT the hero (that's Tenchi)
- The stable presence amid chaos
- Keeps the household fed during crises
- Emotional anchor for everyone

### How the Bond Survives Canon
The aliens arrive expecting a teenage boy alone with his grandfather. They find a family.

**Ryoko:** "Who's this?"
**Tenchi:** "My uncle. He's been here forever."
**Sheldon:** "...Twelve years."
**Tenchi:** "Forever."

## POST-CANON: ADULT RELATIONSHIP

### What Tenchi Becomes
- Hero of cosmic events
- Transcendent being (briefly)
- Eventually: husband, father
- Always: Sheldon's nephew

### What Doesn't Change
- Sheldon still cooks holiday meals
- Tenchi still comes to him with problems
- The bond adapts but doesn't weaken
- "Uncle" becomes honorary, then eternal

### Centuries Later
When Tenchi has his own children, Sheldon is "Great-Uncle Sheru-ji" to them too. The pattern repeats across generations.

---

## THE TRANSFORMATION

### Canon Tenchi (Without Sheldon)
- Raised by grandfather alone (after mother's death)
- Father absent most of the time
- Emotionally isolated
- Women arrive → romantic competition
- Harem dynamics ensue

### This Story's Tenchi (With Sheldon)
- Raised by grandfather AND uncle
- Daily nurturing presence
- Emotionally secure
- Women arrive → extended family welcomes them
- Found family dynamics instead

### The Difference Sheldon Makes
Tenchi doesn't NEED romantic validation from the women who arrive. He already knows he's loved. So they become aunts, not rivals.

---

## VOICE: HOW TENCHI TALKS TO/ABOUT SHELDON

### Age 4-6
- "Sheru-ji!"
- "I want Sheru-ji to read it!"
- "Sheru-ji makes the best food!"

### Age 7-12
- "Uncle Sheldon said..."
- "Can I help cook tonight?"
- "You're weird, Sheru-ji. Good weird."

### Age 13-17
- "Thanks, Uncle Sheldon."
- "I need to tell you something..."
- "You're not gonna freak out, right?"

### Adult
- "My uncle. You'll love him."
- "He's been part of this family longer than most of us."
- "No, he's not human. Neither am I, technically."
