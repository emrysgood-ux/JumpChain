## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 4: Scenes 151-200 (15:46-20:00)
## **Evening - Dinner - Secret Construction**

---

## SCENE 151 | 15:46 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The pre-dinner hours required attention distribution—watching over Tenchi while preparing the meal, the particular multitasking that household management demanded.

"Stay with Ojii-san while I cook."

---

## SCENE 152 | 15:50 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

The kitchen received him with its reliable welcome. Dinner planning engaged—the ingredients available, the techniques applicable, the preferences of household members.

Standard Thursday evening. Nothing elaborate required.

---

## SCENE 153 | 15:54 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Tonight's menu: grilled fish, rice, pickles, miso soup—the foundation of Japanese home cooking, reliable and satisfying.

The fish had been purchased fresh; the quality was apparent in its clear eyes and firm flesh.

---

## SCENE 154 | 15:58 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

His knife work had achieved consistency—each cut the same thickness, the efficiency that marked comfortable competence.

Eighteen days of daily practice. The hands had learned.

---

## SCENE 155 | 16:02 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Fish prepared for grilling, vegetables cut for soup, rice measured and started. The timing orchestration began.

The meal would converge at the appropriate moment.

---

## SCENE 156 | 16:06 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Through the kitchen doorway, he could hear Tenchi with Katsuhito—the murmur of conversation, the occasional laugh.

The household functioned even when he wasn't the primary attention-giver.

---

## SCENE 157 | 16:10 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The puzzle box construction would occupy tonight's late hours. Tenchi's bedtime would free him to work at the Tsukino house.

The secret project added structure to his evenings.

---

## SCENE 158 | 16:14 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Fish to the grill, the heat transforming raw to cooked with predictable chemistry. The smell filled the kitchen—the particular aroma of proteins undergoing the Maillard reaction.

He'd never stop thinking in scientific terms. The framing persisted.

---

## SCENE 159 | 16:18 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

Science and cooking overlapped more than most people acknowledged. Temperature control, timing, the understanding of transformations.

His backgrounds merged without conflict.

---

## SCENE 160 | 16:22 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The fish turned at precise intervals, the crust forming evenly. The technique had become intuitive—judgment based on visual and aromatic cues rather than timers.

Experience as accumulated sensitivity.

---

## SCENE 161 | 16:26 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

"Dinner soon?" Tenchi appeared at the doorway, appetite apparently awakened by cooking smells.

"Ten more minutes. You can set the table."

---

## SCENE 162 | 16:30 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

The boy accepted the task with the seriousness it deserved—plates positioned, chopsticks aligned, the small rituals of household contribution.

Teaching through inclusion. The method worked.

---

## SCENE 163 | 16:34 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Final assembly: fish plated, soup ladled, rice portioned. The components converging into meal.

"Ojii-san! Dinner ready!"

Tenchi's announcement, relayed with enthusiasm.

---

## SCENE 164 | 16:38 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Three settings, three people, the familiar configuration. The household's evening routine proceeding through its established patterns.

"Itadakimasu."

---

## SCENE 165 | 16:42 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The fish received favorable assessment—Katsuhito's nod, Tenchi's enthusiastic consumption, his own satisfaction in the successful preparation.

Simple meal, well executed. The standard to maintain.

---

## SCENE 166 | 16:46 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Subplot

"Three days until my birthday," Tenchi announced. "Then Papa comes, and there's cake, and presents!"

The countdown continued, as it would until the day arrived.

---

## SCENE 167 | 16:50 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Character Development

Three days. The puzzle box required significant progress tonight. The panels needed fitting, the mechanism needed testing.

Time compressed by deadline.

---

## SCENE 168 | 16:54 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Deadlines created focus. The principle had governed his previous career; it governed this project too.

Different context, same psychology.

---

## SCENE 169 | 16:58 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The meal concluded with satisfied sounds. Cleanup would follow, then Tenchi's evening routine, then the secret work could begin.

The schedule structured itself around the gift.

---

## SCENE 170 | 17:02 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Dishes washed with efficient attention. Tenchi dried what he could reach; Sheldon managed the rest.

The collaborative cleanup had become their pattern.

---

## SCENE 171 | 17:06 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Relationship

"Bath time," Katsuhito announced. "Then reading. Then sleep."

The evening routine, established long before Sheldon's arrival, continuing with his participation.

---

## SCENE 172 | 17:10 | Main House - Bath Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The traditional bath—heated by wood fire beneath, the particular warmth of soaked wood and hot water combining.

Tenchi's bath required supervision without intrusion.

---

## SCENE 173 | 17:14 | Main House - Bath Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The boy managed the bathing process with increasing independence. The supervision was precautionary rather than necessary.

"Remember to wash before soaking."

"I know!"

---

## SCENE 174 | 17:18 | Main House - Hallway
**Type:** Character Development

Childhood development: the gradual acquisition of independence, each skill learned freeing adults from supervision duty.

Tenchi was growing. The process was visible in weekly increments.

---

## SCENE 175 | 17:22 | Main House - Tenchi's Room
**Type:** Subplot

Bath complete, pajamas donned, the child ready for the evening's final phase.

"Which book tonight?"

"The tanuki one!"

---

## SCENE 176 | 17:26 | Main House - Tenchi's Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The tanuki book again. The coincidence with his carving project felt meaningful, though he knew it was simply Tenchi's current favorite.

Patterns emerged whether or not they were intended.

---

## SCENE 177 | 17:30 | Main House - Tenchi's Room
**Type:** Main Plot

The reading began, the familiar story unfolding with the rhythm of frequent repetition.

Tenchi's eyes tracked the illustrations, the text less important than the images.

---

## SCENE 178 | 17:34 | Main House - Tenchi's Room
**Type:** Relationship

"The tanuki is tricky but kind," Tenchi observed. "Like Ojii-san."

The comparison was unexpectedly apt.

"That's a good observation."

---

## SCENE 179 | 17:38 | Main House - Tenchi's Room
**Type:** Character Development

The story concluded with the tanuki's successful trick, the humans rewarded for their generosity.

"Time for sleep. Good dreams."

"Night, Sheldon-san."

---

## SCENE 180 | 17:42 | Main House - Hallway
**Type:** Transition

The boy's room settled into darkness, the household's youngest member surrendered to sleep.

The evening's second phase could begin.

---

## SCENE 181 | 17:46 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"I'll work at the Tsukino house tonight," Sheldon informed Katsuhito. "The project requires attention."

The priest nodded without requiring elaboration. The secret was safe.

---

## SCENE 182 | 17:50 | Path to Tsukino House
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The evening walk in fading light, the familiar path navigated with increasing confidence.

The lantern hung ready from his belt; darkness would arrive before work concluded.

---

## SCENE 183 | 17:54 | Path to Tsukino House - Stream
**Type:** Character Development

The stream crossing in twilight, the stones visible but shadowed. His feet found them accurately.

The body's memory exceeded visual requirements.

---

## SCENE 184 | 17:58 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

The house waited with its accumulated presence. He acknowledged it silently—the habit forming despite his rational skepticism.

"I'm here to work."

---

## SCENE 185 | 18:02 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Transition

The outbuilding, the workshop space where the puzzle box took shape. Lantern lit, tools arranged, the evening's construction could proceed.

Focus narrowed to the task.

---

## SCENE 186 | 18:06 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The panels from yesterday's cutting awaited final fitting. Each piece needed to be test-fitted against its neighbors, the tolerances verified.

He began with the first panel, checking its slide through the channel.

---

## SCENE 187 | 18:10 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The fit was too tight—the panel bound at one point, requiring adjustment. The chisel work would be delicate: removing material without removing too much.

Precision in subtraction.

---

## SCENE 188 | 18:14 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

Thin shavings curled from the chisel's edge, each pass removing barely visible material. The adjustment was measured in fractions of millimeters.

Patience was mandatory. Impatience would destroy the work.

---

## SCENE 189 | 18:18 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

Test fit again. Better. Still slight resistance at one point.

Another pass of the chisel, even more conservative.

Test. Smooth movement throughout travel.

---

## SCENE 190 | 18:22 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The satisfaction of correct fit exceeded the small scope of the achievement. Something worked because he'd made it work.

The feeling was addictive.

---

## SCENE 191 | 18:26 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

Second panel preparation. The process repeated—fit too tight, careful adjustment, test, adjustment, success.

The method was established. Repetition would complete the mechanism.

---

## SCENE 192 | 18:30 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The third panel controlled the final reveal—the central compartment that would hold the tanuki.

This panel required the most precise fit. It had to remain closed until both earlier panels aligned correctly.

---

## SCENE 193 | 18:34 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

The mechanism's logic was simple: each panel's movement enabled the next, the sequence building toward revelation.

Simple logic, difficult execution. The story of most worthwhile things.

---

## SCENE 194 | 18:38 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

The third panel's channel required modification. The tolerance here was tighter—movement had to be prevented until the enabling conditions were met.

Counter-intuitive adjustment: making something bind on purpose.

---

## SCENE 195 | 18:42 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The adjustment succeeded. With both other panels neutral, the third wouldn't move. With both correctly positioned, it slid freely.

The mechanism worked.

---

## SCENE 196 | 18:46 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He sat back, examining the box's current state. Structure complete, mechanism functional, only the tanuki carving remained.

Three days. Achievable.

---

## SCENE 197 | 18:50 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

The carving would require tomorrow night. Tonight's work was sufficient—progress without rushing, quality without sacrifice.

The gift would be worthy.

---

## SCENE 198 | 18:54 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Transition

Tools cleaned and stored, the workshop secured. The box remained in its hiding place, awaiting completion.

The walk back to the main house awaited.

---

## SCENE 199 | 18:58 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Quick check of the hokora through the window—the morning's offering undisturbed.

He should replace the rice tomorrow. Fresh offerings showed ongoing attention.

---

## SCENE 200 | 19:02 | Path to Shrine
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The walk back in full darkness, lantern now necessary. The path familiar enough that light supplemented rather than replaced body memory.

Day eighteen ending. The project advancing. The birthday approaching.
