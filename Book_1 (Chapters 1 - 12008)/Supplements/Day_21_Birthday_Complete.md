---

## SCENE 005 | 04:49 | Main House - Kitchen

Traditional celebration foods: tai—sea bream—for luck and joy, sekihan—red rice with azuki beans—for auspicious occasions. The components of Japanese festivity.

"Papa comes at eight. In about two and a half hours."

"That's so long!"

Two and a half hours as eternity. Five years as unit of measurement.

Time's elasticity depended entirely on perspective.

---

## SCENE 019 | 05:45 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

The child's energy required management—too much excitement, too early, meant exhaustion before the celebration peaked.

"Breakfast when Papa arrives. For now, let's get you dressed properly."

**Type:** Worldbuilding

Special clothes for special day—Katsuhito had laid out a new outfit, traditional in style, sized for a five-year-old.

The workshop held its secrets. The puzzle box emerged first—the finish had cured properly, the wood glowing with protected warmth.

Then the tanuki—the carving's features sharp and clear, the mischievous expression perfectly preserved.

---

## SCENE 031 | 06:37 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

He placed the tanuki inside the puzzle box, testing the fit one final time.

Perfect. The compartment held the figure securely. The mechanism worked smoothly.

The gift was complete.

---

Wrapping: he'd prepared cloth for the purpose—a simple furoshiki in blue, the traditional Japanese wrapping method.

The box disappeared into folded fabric, the gift now concealed and presentable.

---

"It's a secret. For later."

---

**Type:** Main Plot

The gift hidden with other presents—Katsuhito's hero book, presumably Nobuyuki's contribution yet to arrive.

The collection would appear at the appropriate moment.

---

Sheldon observed from appropriate distance, allowing the moment its privacy.

A question requiring navigation.

True enough without being complete. The explanation satisfied for now; deeper questions could wait.

The meal proceeded with appreciation from all quarters.

The red rice received particular attention—the traditional significance understood, the execution appreciated.

**Type:** Subplot

Nobuyuki examined the box when offered—the architect's eye evaluating the joinery, the fit, the finish.

**Type:** Relationship/Character Development

Nobuyuki sought him out during Tenchi's rest time.

"I have questions."

"I expected you would."

The conversation occurred on the engawa, the afternoon light casting long shadows.

"You appeared three weeks ago. No one knows where from. You cook like a chef, build like a craftsman, and my father-in-law trusts you completely."

"All accurate observations."

"Who are you?"

The question deserved honesty within available limits.

"A man who needed refuge and found one. A man who discovered skills he didn't know he had. A man who cares about your son's wellbeing."

"That's not an answer."

"It's the answer I can give."

---

## SCENE 151-175 | Father's Assessment
**Type:** Internal Reflection/Subplot

Nobuyuki's evaluation continued through silence.

"My father-in-law doesn't trust easily. If he accepts you, there's reason."

"I've tried to earn that acceptance."

"The puzzle box alone demonstrates significant capability. The meal demonstrates more. Whatever your history, your present seems genuine."

The conditional acceptance: not full trust, but willingness to observe further.

"I'll be here regardless of what you conclude," Sheldon offered. "Unless the family asks me to leave."

"No one is asking that. Tenchi adores you."

---

## SCENE 176-200 | Evening Approach
**Type:** Transition/Main Plot

The afternoon yielded to evening. Birthday cake appeared—arranged through village baker, decorated appropriately for five-year-old taste.

Candles lit. Wish made. Blown out with single breath.

The wisdom of birthday protocol.

"Better than four."

---

**Type:** Main Plot/Internal Reflection

After Tenchi slept, the adults gathered for tea.

"Children are resilient when properly supported."

"And you've been part of that support."

---

## SCENE 271-285 | Resolution
**Type:** Character Development/Relationship

"I should investigate you," Nobuyuki said eventually. "Find out who you actually are."

"You could try."

"But I won't. Not yet. Tenchi's wellbeing matters more than my curiosity."

"A reasonable priority."

"Whatever brought you here, whatever you're not saying—my son calls this home. You're part of what makes it home for him."

The acceptance was conditional, provisional—but real.

---
