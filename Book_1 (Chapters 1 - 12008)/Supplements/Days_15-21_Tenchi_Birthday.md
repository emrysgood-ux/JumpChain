## **Birthday Week**

---

# DAY 15 - APRIL 17, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **One Week Until Birthday**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes, child-length)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

Seven sleeps until birthday.

Tenchi counted on his fingers while eating breakfast. Seven fingers. Seven mornings. Then he would be five.

"You're concentrating very hard."

"Counting."

"What are you counting?"

"Days until I'm five."

---

Sheldon-san smiled. Not the fake smile adults did sometimes—the real one that moved his whole face.

"Seven days is a long time at your age."

"It's SO long."

"It will pass. It always does."

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-220)

School was about numbers today. Counting, adding, the shapes numbers made.

Four plus one equals five. That was him. Four right now, plus one birthday, equals five.

"What's five plus one?"

"Six," the teacher said. "But you won't be six for a long time."

---

Home again. Sheldon-san was making something. Wood pieces on the workbench. Careful movements.

"What is it?"

"A secret."

"Secrets are hard."

"They are. But this one is worth keeping."

---

**Day 15 Summary:**
- Birthday countdown begins
- Secret project noticed

---

# DAY 16 - APRIL 18, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **Six Days**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## FULL DAY

Six sleeps now. The counting was easier with fewer fingers.

The secret project continued. Wood shavings on the floor, sounds of tools when Tenchi wasn't supposed to be watching.

"Is it for me?"

"What makes you think that?"

"You're making it during birthday week."

The pause. The thinking-pause adults did when children surprised them.

"You're very observant."

"Is that yes?"

"That's wait and see."

---

The garden sprouts were taller now. Tenchi measured them against his hand—past his thumb, past his first knuckle.

"They're growing!"

"Every day. Just like you."

"Am I growing every day?"

"Every day. Even when you can't tell."

---

**Day 16 Summary:**
- Countdown continues
- Growth comparison (sprouts and self)

---

# DAY 17 - APRIL 19, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## **Five Days**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## FULL DAY

Five days. Five fingers on one hand. The number he would become.

Ojii-san was talking to Sheldon-san about Papa. About when Papa would come. About how long Papa would stay.

"For the birthday?"

"For the birthday, yes. Papa is coming for your birthday."

"Really?"

"Really."

---

Papa didn't visit much. Papa lived far away, in the city where he built houses. Kurashiki, which was a word Tenchi could say but not a place he could picture.

"Does Papa like Sheldon-san?"

"They haven't met yet."

"Will Papa like him?"

The pause. The careful pause.

"I hope so."

---

The wood project made sounds again that night. Quiet sounds, after bedtime. Tenchi listened instead of sleeping.

Tap tap tap. Scrape scrape. Tap tap.

Someone was working hard on his secret.

---

**Day 17 Summary:**
- Papa visit confirmed
- Anticipation building
- Nighttime work sounds noted

---

# DAY 18 - APRIL 20, 1989 (THURSDAY)
## **Four Days**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## FULL DAY

Four days. Four fingers. Less than a whole hand.

The sprouts had more leaves now. Different shapes depending on what they would become.

"That one looks different."

"That one's a radish. Those are onions. Those are greens."

"How do you know?"

"The leaves tell you, if you learn to read them."

---

Reading leaves. Reading numbers. Reading the sounds Papa made on the phone.

"I'll be there Saturday morning," the phone-voice said. Papa's voice, small and far away.

"Saturday!"

"Saturday. I promised."

---

The secret project was hidden now. Somewhere Tenchi couldn't find it. He had looked.

"It's not under your bed."

Sheldon-san laughed. Really laughed, the kind that came from deep inside.

"Good looking. But no. Somewhere safer."

---

**Day 18 Summary:**
- Leaf-reading concept
- Phone call with Papa
- Secret project hidden

---

# DAY 19 - APRIL 21, 1989 (FRIDAY)
## **Three Days**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## FULL DAY

Three days. Three was smaller than four, and Saturday was one of those days.

Tomorrow Papa would come. Tomorrow Sheldon-san would meet Papa. Tomorrow everything would be different and maybe better.

"What if Papa doesn't like you?"

The question came out before Tenchi could stop it. Words did that sometimes.

"Then he doesn't like me. That would be sad, but it wouldn't change how I feel about being here."

"Would you leave?"

"Not unless your grandfather asked me to."

---

The relief was big. Too big for Tenchi's chest. It came out as a hug instead of words.

Sheldon-san hugged back. Carefully, like Tenchi was made of something breakable.

"I'm not going anywhere. Whatever happens with Papa."

---

**Day 19 Summary:**
- Anxiety about Papa meeting expressed
- Reassurance received
- First hug with Sheldon

---

# DAY 20 - APRIL 22, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## **Two Days - Papa Arrives**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

Papa's car was coming up the mountain road. Tenchi could hear it before he could see it.

"PAPA!"

The run to the parking area. The car stopping. The door opening.

Papa looked the same. Maybe a little more gray in his hair. Maybe a little more tired around his eyes. But Papa.

"There's my boy!"

The hug was big and strong and smelled like Papa's cologne. City smell, car smell, far-away smell.

---

## THE MEETING (Scenes 101-150)

Papa and Sheldon-san shook hands. Adults did that—touched hands and looked at each other like they were asking questions without words.

"My father has told me about you."

"Only good things, I hope."

"Interesting things."

---

The looking went on for a long time. Tenchi watched both faces, trying to read them like leaves.

Sheldon-san: calm, steady, the same as always.

Papa: thinking, measuring, deciding something.

"Your breakfast was excellent."

"Thank you. I wasn't sure about the sea bream."

"It was perfect."

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-220)

Papa and Sheldon-san talked while Tenchi played nearby. Adult talk about houses and work and money. Boring words with important feelings underneath.

But they weren't fighting. They weren't angry. They were just... talking.

"He's been good for Tenchi."

"I've tried to be useful."

"Useful is one word for it."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 221-299)

Dinner all together. Four people at the table, the most since... Tenchi couldn't remember. Since before Mama was gone.

The food was the best yet. Sheldon-san had made everything special for the almost-birthday. For Papa being here. For the household being full.

"Two more sleeps," Tenchi announced.

"Two more sleeps," Papa agreed. "Then you'll be the big five."

---

**Day 20 Summary:**
- Papa arrived
- First meeting observed
- Adult dynamics read (not hostile)
- Full household felt

---

# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## **Birthday Celebration Day**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING - PRESENTS (Scenes 001-100)

The celebration was today because Papa was here. The real birthday—the five day—was tomorrow. But presents and cake were today.

Breakfast was special. Red rice, the lucky fish, everything arranged like a picture.

"Happy birthday, Tenchi."

"It's not until tomorrow!"

"But we celebrate today, when Papa is here."

---

The presents came in order. Papa first: a building set with lots of pieces, clothes that were too big but would fit later, books about heroes.

Ojii-san second: a very old book with a leather cover. Hero stories that had belonged to his own papa, long ago.

"This is precious," Ojii-san said. "Guard it well."

The weight of the book felt like a responsibility. Like Tenchi was being trusted with something important.

---

## THE BOX (Scenes 101-150)

Then Sheldon-san's present. The wrapped package that had been hidden so well.

Inside: a wooden box. Beautiful, with lines and patterns carved into the sides.

"It's a puzzle," Sheldon-san said. "The box opens, but you have to find out how."

---

Tenchi's fingers touched the wood. Smooth and warm. The lines weren't just decorations—they were paths. Hints. Clues.

Push here. Slide this. Turn that.

The click when the first panel moved. Then another click. Then another.

The box opened.

And inside—

"TANUKI!"

A wooden tanuki, small and perfect, with a round belly and a mischievous face.

"You made him!"

"I made both of them. The box and the friend inside."

---

## AFTERNOON - TOGETHER (Scenes 151-220)

The tanuki sat on the table while Tenchi played with the building set. Papa helped with the tricky parts. Ojii-san read from the hero book.

Sheldon-san watched, smiling the real smile.

Everything was right. Everyone was here. Even the people who weren't here—Mama in the sky, the man who used to live in the sick house—even they felt close somehow.

---

## EVENING - CAKE (Scenes 221-270)

The cake had five candles, even though five wasn't until tomorrow.

"Make a wish!"

Tenchi closed his eyes. The wish was easy. The same wish he'd been wishing all week.

*Let this stay. Let everyone stay. Let the good things keep being good.*

The candles went out in one breath.

---

## BEDTIME (Scenes 271-299)

Papa would leave tomorrow. Would drive back to Kurashiki after the real birthday morning.

"I don't want you to go."

"I know. But I'll come back. And you have Ojii-san. And now you have Sheldon-san too."

The new truth settled. Sheldon-san was part of "having." Part of the people who stayed.

"I love you, Papa."

"I love you too, big guy. Happy almost-five."

---

The tanuki sat on the pillow beside him. The puzzle box waited for morning, when he would solve it again just because he could.

Tomorrow he would be five. Really five.

But tonight, four years and 364 days, was perfect enough.

---
