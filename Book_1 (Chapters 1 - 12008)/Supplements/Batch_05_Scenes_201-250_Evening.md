Nobuyuki asked about village connections, the web of relationships that supported property restoration.

## SCENE 206 | 18:21 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Relationship

"Yamada handles most repairs. Tanaka's store supplies materials. The village operates on connection rather than transaction."
