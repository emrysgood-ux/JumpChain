## **Week Three: Birthday Coming!**

---

# DAY 15 - APRIL 17, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **Countdown Begins**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-030 | The Calendar**
The calendar had numbers on it. Tomorrow would get an X. Then another. Then another. Then BIRTHDAY.

Seven more sleeps until birthday. No, six. No—Tenchi counted on his fingers. Seven.

"Grandpa, how many sleeps?"

"Until your birthday? Seven."

Seven was a lot. But also not that much. Tenchi could wait seven sleeps.

---

**SCENE 031-060 | Breakfast Thoughts**
The man made something new. Little pancakes with sweet stuff inside.

"What are these called?"

"Dorayaki."

"Dora-yaki." The word was round like the pancake. "I like them."

"I thought you might."

Birthday was coming. Would there be birthday dorayaki? Birthday everything?

---

**SCENE 061-100 | School With Anticipation**
Every day now was a day closer. The blocks were birthday-colored (everything was). The crayons made birthday pictures. The stories were about birthdays (even when they weren't).

"You're drawing a cake," the teacher said.

"It's my birthday soon. Seven sleeps."

"How exciting! You'll be five."

Five was big. Five fingers on each hand. Five was how old you were when you started being real-kid instead of little-kid.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-150 | Coming Home**
The man was doing something secret. He wouldn't show.

"What is it?"

"A surprise."

"For me?"

"Maybe."

Secrets! Surprises! Birthday things were starting. Tenchi could feel them building like clouds before rain.

---

**SCENE 151-200 | Evening Questions**
"Is Papa coming for my birthday?"

"He said he would try."

"Trying" wasn't the same as "yes." Tenchi knew that. But hoping was still allowed.

"Will there be cake?"

"What birthday doesn't have cake?"

Cake was definite. Papa was trying. The man had a surprise. Seven sleeps. Six after tonight.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-250 | The Secret Project**
The man worked on something after Tenchi went to bed. Little sounds came from the guest room. Tapping. Scraping. Quiet sounds, but Tenchi heard them.

A present. The man was making a present.

Made things were special. You couldn't buy them; you had to care enough to make them.

---

**SCENE 251-299 | Sleep With Dreams**
Birthday dreams. Cake dreams. Papa dreams. The man's surprise dreams.

Six sleeps now. The night counted.

---

## DAY 15 COMPLETE

---

# DAYS 16-20 SUMMARIES
## **The Countdown**

---

## DAY 16 (TUESDAY) - Five Sleeps

The man asked careful questions.

"What animals do you like best?"

"Tanuki!"

"Why tanuki?"

"They're tricky but nice. They play jokes but not mean jokes."

The man nodded like this was important information. Like Tenchi's answer mattered for something.

Five sleeps. The secret project sounds continued at night.

---

## DAY 17 (WEDNESDAY) - Four Sleeps

Papa called on the phone. His voice sounded far away but real.

"I'll be there, Tenchi. I promise."

"You PROMISE promise?"

"I promise promise."

Promise promise was the biggest promise. Papa would come.

The man was working on something at the other house. The broken house. Grandpa said there was roof trouble. But the man also worked on the secret thing at night.

Four sleeps.

---

## DAY 18 (THURSDAY) - Three Sleeps

The man let Tenchi see a little bit. Not the whole thing. Just a piece.

Wood. Shiny, polished wood.

"Is it a box?"

"Part of it is. But it's special."

Special how? Tenchi couldn't guess. Three sleeps to find out.

---

## DAY 19 (FRIDAY) - Two Sleeps

The house felt different. Like it was holding its breath for something good.

Grandpa smiled more. The man hummed while cooking. Even the mountain seemed excited.

"The mountain knows it's my birthday soon," Tenchi said.

"Mountains know many things," Grandpa agreed.

Two sleeps. Almost there. Almost almost almost.

---

## DAY 20 (SATURDAY) - One Sleep

Tomorrow was the day before. Then THE DAY.

Tenchi couldn't sit still. Couldn't focus. Everything was birthday-flavored.

"One more sleep, then one more sleep, then BIRTHDAY."

"Correct counting," the man said.

The secret was finished. Tenchi could tell because the man looked satisfied instead of working-focused.

One sleep until the day before. Two sleeps until everything.

---

# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## **The Day Before**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-030 | Wake Up Knowing**
Tomorrow. Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow.

Tenchi bounced out of bed. No cold-floor game today. Too excited for games.

The man was already cooking. Breakfast smelled special, like the day was already starting to be birthday.

"TOMORROW!"

"Tomorrow indeed. How do you feel?"

"Like sparklers! Like fireworks! Like—like—" No words big enough. "TOMORROW!"

---

**SCENE 031-060 | Papa Confirmation**
Grandpa said Papa would arrive in the morning. Early, before breakfast.

"He'll sleep here?"

"Yes. The guest room."

But the man was in the guest room. Tenchi's face went worried.

"I'll sleep elsewhere," the man said. "There's a spot in the other house that's safe."

The man was giving up his room for Papa. That was a big thing. That was family-thing.

---

**SCENE 061-100 | Preparation**
The house got extra clean. The man helped. Everything shined and smelled like lemons and fresh air.

Birthday-ready. The house was becoming birthday-ready.

One sleep. Just one more sleep.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-150 | No School!**
Sunday meant no school. All day to be excited. All day to imagine.

Tenchi made a list in his head:
- Cake (definitely)
- Papa (coming in the morning)
- Presents (Grandpa's, Papa's, maybe the man's)
- Being five (finally finally finally)

The list was perfect. Tomorrow would be perfect.

---

**SCENE 151-200 | The Man's Gift**
The man showed it. Finally.

A box. But not a regular box. A puzzle box.

"It opens, but only if you figure out how."

Tenchi touched it. The wood was smooth like water frozen into solid. Little panels moved when you pressed them right.

"There's something inside?"

"Find out tomorrow."

Inside the puzzle was a secret. Tomorrow Tenchi would discover both—how to open it, and what hid within.

The waiting was hard. But also delicious, like smelling dinner before eating.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-250 | Last Dinner as Four**
The man made Tenchi's favorites: rice balls, the crunchy vegetables, the soup that warmed inside.

"Tomorrow you'll be five."

"I know!"

"How does it feel, almost being five?"

"Big. It feels big."

Four was little. Five was... the start of not-little. The start of being real. Tenchi could feel the bigness waiting.

---

**SCENE 251-299 | Sleeping (Trying)**
The futon was too soft. The room was too quiet. Everything was too much.

Tomorrow Papa would be here. Tomorrow the box would open. Tomorrow cake and candles and being FIVE.

Tenchi closed his eyes tight tight tight.

Sleep came eventually. It carried dreams of tanuki and puzzles and birthday songs.
