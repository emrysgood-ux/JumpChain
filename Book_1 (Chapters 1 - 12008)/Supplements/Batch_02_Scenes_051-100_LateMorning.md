## SCENE 051 | 08:25 | Village - Yamada Workshop

"How bad is the damage?" Yamada asked, pulling out a worn notebook.

"Water damage in one room, floor to ceiling. The tiles have shifted in several locations above it."

---

## SCENE 052 | 08:29 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Yamada made notes, his experience converting description to assessment.

"Nishida will want to see it himself. Tile work requires inspection before quoting."

**Type:** Character Development

"Can you arrange an introduction?"

"I'll send word. Expect him within the week. He's reliable."

## SCENE 054 | 08:37 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Subplot

"The wheel—can I transport it now, or should I collect it later?"

"Now is fine. The cart is yours; the wheel should join it."

---

## SCENE 055 | 08:41 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Main Plot

The wheel was lighter than expected, or he was stronger than he'd been. Both possibilities seemed true.

"What do I owe for the repair?"

---

## SCENE 056 | 08:45 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Yamada named a figure—reasonable, fair, lower than he'd expected from research.

"Community price," the carpenter explained. "The shrine's property. We all benefit."

Community price. The concept had appeared before—reduced rates for those contributing to shared welfare.

Economics interwoven with social fabric.

**Type:** Character Development

Payment rendered, wheel shouldered. The repair marked completion of another small project.

The walk through the village with wheel balanced—an unusual sight, drawing occasional glances.

The shrine steps would present a challenge.

---

## SCENE 060 | 09:01 | Village Path

Physical problem-solving through movement.

He began, choosing each placement with precision.

## SCENE 071 | 09:53 | Shrine Grounds - Main Area
**Type:** Subplot

Katsuhito nodded, the name apparently familiar. "Nishida is skilled. Expensive but thorough."

"The damage requires thorough."

"Then he is the right choice."

---

## SCENE 072 | 09:57 | Shrine Grounds - Main Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection
