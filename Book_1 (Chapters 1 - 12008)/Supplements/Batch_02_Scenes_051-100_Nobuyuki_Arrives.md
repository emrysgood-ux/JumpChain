The father meeting the stranger who lived with his son. The dynamic could become complicated.

He'd prepared no explanation beyond simple truth: stranded, taken in, contributing.

---

## SCENE 055 | 08:17 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

The train from Kurashiki would have departed early morning. Travel time, station to steps, ascent.

Mid-morning arrival remained the estimate.

Tenchi's patience deteriorating. The child had relocated to the engawa, watching the path.

A good day for a birthday. A good day for arrivals.

"Will Papa like my present from you?"

The question unexpected. Tenchi hadn't seen the gift yet.

"But you made it. Will Papa think it's good?"

---

## SCENE 059 | 08:33 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The child's concern: parental approval of something the child valued.

The layers of social dynamics even at five years old.

"I hope so. Your father cares about quality."

Movement on the lower path—distant, but visible from the elevation.

A figure emerging from the tree line near the base of the steps.

"PAPA!"

The descent began—Tenchi barely controlled, Sheldon following closely.

The figure below resolved: male, adult, climbing with the particular pace of someone who'd made this ascent before.

---

## SCENE 064 | 08:53 | Shrine Steps - Middle
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Nobuyuki Masaki. Tenchi's father. Katsuhito's son-in-law. The man whose judgment would matter.

First impressions approaching at convergent speeds.

Father and son embracing on the mountain steps, the morning light catching them perfectly.

---

## SCENE 068 | 09:09 | Shrine Steps - Meeting Point
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Nobuyuki appeared mid-forties in the way that didn't quite match the math. Dark hair with distinguished gray at the temples. The build of someone who'd once been athletic and maintained some of it.

An architect's hands—capable and observant.

---

## SCENE 069 | 09:13 | Shrine Steps - Meeting Point
**Type:** Main Plot

The attention transferred. Nobuyuki's eyes found him over Tenchi's head.

Assessment immediate and unhidden. The evaluating gaze of a father encountering the unknown.

---

## SCENE 070 | 09:17 | Shrine Steps - Meeting Point
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He met the gaze directly. No advantage in avoidance, no benefit in submission.

The stranger who lived with the man's son should be willing to be examined.

---

## SCENE 071 | 09:21 | Shrine Steps - Meeting Point
**Type:** Relationship

"You must be Tsukino-san." The voice neutral, data-gathering. "Father-in-law mentioned you."

"Masaki-san. Welcome. Happy birthday to your son."

---

## SCENE 072 | 09:25 | Shrine Steps - Meeting Point
**Type:** Character Development

The handshake crossed the distance—firm, brief, the communication of measurement.

"Thank you for..." Nobuyuki paused, recalibrating. "Father said you've been helpful."

"The household welcomed me. I try to earn the generosity."

---

## SCENE 073 | 09:29 | Shrine Steps - Ascent
**Type:** Transition

The three began the climb. Tenchi between them, holding his father's hand, narrating everything.

"Sheldon-san made breakfast! Sea bream! And he's been making something for me but I don't know what!"

---

## SCENE 074 | 09:33 | Shrine Steps - Upper Third
**Type:** Main Plot

Nobuyuki's glance carried curiosity. "You cook?"

"I've discovered an aptitude."

"Discovered?"

"The ability emerged when needed."

---

## SCENE 075 | 09:37 | Shrine Steps - Upper Third
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The partial truth invited questions. He let them remain unasked, the climb continuing.

The full explanation would require time and context not currently available.

---

## SCENE 076 | 09:41 | Shrine Grounds - Entry
**Type:** Character Development

Through the torii, onto sacred ground. Nobuyuki's pace slowed—respect for the space, or memory.

His wife had grown up here.

---

## SCENE 077 | 09:45 | Shrine Grounds - Main Path
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Katsuhito waited on the main house engawa, formal in posture, the patriarch receiving the visitor.

"Nobuyuki. Welcome."

"Father. Thank you for having me."

"Papa brought presents!"

"After we settle. Give your father time to breathe."

---

## SCENE 080 | 09:57 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Relationship

The settling took time. Tea prepared. Conversation initiated about the journey, the work in Kurashiki, the mundane topics that established normalcy.

Tenchi's patience tested but holding.

---

## SCENE 081 | 10:01 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"The boy has waited long enough," Katsuhito finally announced. "Birthday gifts may be exchanged."

Tenchi's response was immediate and physical—a small body bouncing with released anticipation.

---

## SCENE 082 | 10:05 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

The gift-giving order established by unstated protocol. Father first, then grandfather, then the newcomer.

Sheldon retrieved his wrapped puzzle box from the genkan, positioning it last in the sequence.

---

## SCENE 083 | 10:09 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Nobuyuki's gifts emerged: a construction set, complex and challenging. Picture books, colorfully illustrated. New clothes, already outgrown by spring growth.

The abundance of parental devotion expressed materially.

---

## SCENE 084 | 10:13 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"The building set is like what Papa uses?"

"Similar principles. You can make houses, bridges, towers. Anything you imagine."

"I want to build a castle!"

---

## SCENE 085 | 10:17 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The gift aligned perfectly—father's profession becoming child's play, the connection across generations and distance.

Sheldon observed the moment with something like gratitude for its existence.

---

## SCENE 086 | 10:21 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Relationship

Katsuhito's gift followed: a book, leather-bound, clearly old.

"Stories of heroes. My father's book, and his father's before. Now yours."

---

## SCENE 087 | 10:25 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

Tenchi received the book with unusual solemnity, the weight of inheritance understood even at five.

"I'll take good care of it, Ojii-san."

"I know you will."

---

## SCENE 088 | 10:29 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

And now the third gift. The puzzle box wrapped in cloth, waiting.

"This is from Sheldon-san."

All attention converged.

---

## SCENE 089 | 10:33 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Subplot

Small hands took the package, testing its weight. The shape unidentifiable through the wrapping.

"It's heavy. What is it?"

"Open it and see."

---

## SCENE 090 | 10:37 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

The cloth fell away. The puzzle box revealed—cypress gleaming, panels visible, function unclear.

"A box?"

"A special box. It has a secret."

---

## SCENE 091 | 10:41 | Main House - Common Area

Tenchi's face shifted from uncertainty to curiosity. A secret. A puzzle. Something to solve.

The hook had caught.

"This one moves!"

"Good. What happens when you move it?"

---

The first panel slid, revealing the channel for the second. The mechanism designed exactly for this—sequential discovery, each success enabling the next.

"There's another one!"

The assessment continued, now including the evidence of skilled work.

---

## SCENE 095 | 10:57 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Second panel sliding. The resistance at the third—wrong direction first, then correct.

The compartment opening.

Inside: the tanuki, carved and waiting with its mischievous smile.

---

## SCENE 096 | 11:01 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

"TANUKI!"

The delight was immediate and total. The layers of discovery—box, mechanism, hidden treasure—combining into a single moment of joy.

---

## SCENE 097 | 11:05 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The satisfaction filled him—hours of work justified by seconds of reaction. The gift had succeeded.

This was why craft existed. This was why effort mattered.

---

## SCENE 098 | 11:09 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"You made this?" Nobuyuki's voice carried genuine surprise. "The box and the carving?"

"Both. From cypress on the property. Scrap wood, given new purpose."
