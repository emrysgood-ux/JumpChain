# DAY 24 - APRIL 26, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
## **Pre-Assessment Day - Final Preparations**

---

### BATCH 1: Scenes 001-050 (04:30-08:30)
## **Pre-Dawn - Morning Routine - Assessment Anticipation**

---

## SCENE 001 | 04:29 | Main House - Guest Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Day twenty-four. Tomorrow Nishida would arrive—the roof specialist whose assessment would determine the Tsukino house's future.

Sleep had come reluctantly, the anticipation of professional judgment creating its own particular pressure.

---

## SCENE 002 | 04:33 | Main House - Guest Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The preparation felt complete, yet incompleteness nagged. Had he cleared enough access? Documented enough damage? Prepared the right questions?

The uncertainty of awaiting expert opinion—the knowledge that his own assessment would be tested against professional standards.

---

## SCENE 003 | 04:37 | Main House - Hallway
**Type:** Character Development

The hallway's darkness held its familiar quality. The household breathing around him—Katsuhito's ancient rhythms, Tenchi's childhood sleep, the building itself settling against the mountain's slope.

Tomorrow this quiet would be disrupted by examination.

---

## SCENE 004 | 04:41 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen received him with its consistent welcome. The preparation of breakfast beginning through automatic sequence—the body moving while the mind processed tomorrow's implications.

Rice measured. Water added. The cooker beginning its patient work.

---

## SCENE 005 | 04:45 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The menu established by habit now: miso soup varying by available ingredients, fish or egg as protein, rice as foundation, pickled vegetables as accent.

The reliable architecture of Japanese breakfast, the structure that had organized his mornings for twenty-four days.

---

## SCENE 006 | 04:49 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Today's preparation required additional planning beyond breakfast. Lunch for transport—Nishida's visit would consume most of the working day.

The mental list formed: onigiri for portability, tamagoyaki that traveled well, pickles in their container.

---

## SCENE 007 | 04:53 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The fish today was mackerel—salt-grilled, the traditional preparation that required nothing but proper technique.

His hands salted the fillets, the motion now instinctive. The muscle memory of these weeks asserting itself through repeated practice.

---

## SCENE 008 | 04:57 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

What would Nishida find? The visible damage was concerning; the hidden damage might be worse. The professional eye would see what amateur observation missed.

The cost implications remained unknown. The community's pricing—Yamada's "community rate"—might not apply to specialists from Kurashiki.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:01 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The rice cooker clicked through its cycle. The miso soup simmered. The mackerel approached proper temperature.

The morning's meal converging toward its standard excellence.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:05 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Katsuhito's footsteps—the priest rising to his morning practice.

"Tomorrow approaches quickly."

"The preparation continues today. I'll spend most of the day at the house."

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:09 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

"The mountain decides what the mountain offers. Nishida will assess; you will respond to his assessment."

"Uncertainty is uncomfortable."

"Uncertainty is honest. False certainty is the greater danger."

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:13 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The wisdom carried its usual weight—the priest's observations arriving precisely when needed, the phrasing that invited reflection rather than demanding response.

"I'll prepare as thoroughly as possible. The rest is beyond my control."

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:17 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Subplot

Small footsteps—Tenchi emerging earlier than usual, the patterns still disrupted by the week's events.

"Good morning, Sheldon-san."

"Good morning. You're up early."

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:21 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"I couldn't sleep more. My head was too busy."

"Busy with what?"

"Thinking about things. Papa. The puzzle box. The hero book."

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:25 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The child's processing continuing through sleep and waking. The birthday's abundance requiring integration, the departure requiring acceptance.

The mind worked through its questions regardless of schedule.

---

## SCENE 016 | 05:29 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Breakfast arranged for three. The configuration restored, the temporary expansion concluded.

"Itadakimasu."

The morning meal beginning with its ritual acknowledgment.

---

## SCENE 017 | 05:33 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Character Development

The mackerel achieved proper balance—crisp skin, tender flesh, the salt enhancing rather than overwhelming.

"This fish is really good, Sheldon-san."

"Thank you. The preparation is traditional."

---

## SCENE 018 | 05:37 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Subplot

"What will you do today?"

"Work at the Tsukino house. Preparing for the roof man tomorrow."

"Can I come?"

---

## SCENE 019 | 05:41 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The request required consideration. The upper floor held hazards; the work required focus; the child's presence would complicate both.

"Part of the day. The morning, perhaps. The afternoon work is in areas that aren't safe for children."

---

## SCENE 020 | 05:45 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Relationship

"Okay." The acceptance came without argument—the child learning to accept partial fulfillment of requests.

Progress. The birthday marking more than age.

---

## SCENE 021 | 05:49 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The meal continued through its natural course. The household's conversation light, the underlying currents managed through familiar navigation.

Tomorrow's assessment waiting in the background of every thought.

---

## SCENE 022 | 05:53 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Transition

The meal concluded. Plates cleared, the collaborative effort now routine.

"Morning shrine duties first. Then I'll take Tenchi to the house."

---

## SCENE 023-050 | Morning Activities
**Type:** Main Plot/Worldbuilding/Character Development

The morning proceeded through its established pattern. Shrine grounds swept, offerings attended, the Zen garden receiving its continued restoration.

Tenchi participated where possible—raking within his capability, fetching tools within his reach. The contribution meaningful even when minimal.

The garden's restoration advanced: moss areas cleared, gravel patterns refined, the viewing angles improved. The work that would never truly end, only achieve temporary states of completion.

Mid-morning brought departure for the Tsukino house. The packed lunch distributed—Katsuhito's portion remaining at the shrine, the rest traveling.

---

### BATCH 2: Scenes 051-100 (08:34-12:00)
## **Tsukino House - Final Preparations**

---

## SCENE 051-075 | Upper Floor Access
**Type:** Main Plot/Character Development

The Tsukino house received them with its particular silence. The weeks of work had begun transforming the structure—the lower floor showing signs of reclamation, the upper floor remaining the primary concern.

Tenchi explored the safe areas while Sheldon continued preparation.

The upper floor's access routes: which boards held weight reliably, which beams showed stress, which areas should be avoided entirely. The mental map that would guide Nishida's assessment.

The sagging beam—the primary structural concern—remained stable but concerning. The deflection visible to untrained eye; the implications requiring professional interpretation.

Water damage evidence: stains marking historical intrusion, the patterns suggesting multiple leak points over multiple years. The roof hadn't failed suddenly; it had failed gradually, each storm adding to the accumulated compromise.

---

## SCENE 076-100 | Documentation and Lunch
**Type:** Subplot/Worldbuilding

The documentation continued through midday. Notes on visible damage, questions for the specialist, concerns requiring address.

Lunch on the engawa—the packed onigiri and tamagoyaki consumed while overlooking the overgrown garden.

"This place is old," Tenchi observed.

"Very old. Older than your grandfather."

"That's really old."

The child's measurement system: Ojii-san as unit of antiquity.

"The man coming tomorrow will help us understand how to fix it."

"Fix it like you fixed the cart?"

"Similar. But bigger. Much bigger."

---

### BATCH 3-4: Scenes 101-200 (12:04-18:00)
## **Afternoon Work - Continued Preparation**

---

## SCENE 101-150 | Solo Afternoon Work
**Type:** Main Plot/Character Development

After lunch, Tenchi returned to the shrine with Katsuhito's assistance—the arrangement preplanned, the dangerous afternoon work requiring sole focus.

The upper floor demanded systematic attention. Each room assessed, each hazard noted, each access point evaluated for professional navigation.

The main support beam: the deflection measured through improvised methods—string level, carpenter's eye, the comparison to supposedly parallel surfaces. The sag was significant. Whether "significant" meant "repairable" or "catastrophic" remained tomorrow's revelation.

The roof itself: visible from the upper floor through gaps where ceiling had failed. The tiles displaced, the underlayment compromised, the wooden structure beneath showing age beyond reasonable service life.

The questions accumulated: Was the damage localized or systemic? Could sections be repaired while others were replaced? What was the structural minimum required for habitation?

The afternoon consumed itself in preparation. Each hour adding detail to the picture Nishida would complete.

---

## SCENE 151-200 | Late Afternoon Assessment
**Type:** Subplot/Internal Reflection

The light began failing—the signal that work must pause. The upper floor documented as thoroughly as amateur capability permitted.

The walk-through complete, Sheldon descended to the main floor. The lower areas would support Nishida's entry; the tour route planned to maximize information while minimizing risk.

The questions for tomorrow, compiled:
- Can the main support beam be reinforced, or must it be replaced?
- What is the minimum repair required for safe habitation?
- What is the optimal repair for long-term preservation?
- What timeline does the damage demand?
- What costs should be anticipated?

The practical concerns of renovation crystallizing into concrete queries.

---

### BATCH 5-6: Scenes 201-299 (18:04-22:30 + Reflection)
## **Evening Return - Household Time - Reflection**

---

## SCENE 201-250 | Dinner and Evening
**Type:** Main Plot/Relationship

The return to the shrine brought the day toward its domestic conclusion. Dinner preparation, the evening meal, the household gathered around familiar food.

"Tomorrow the roof man comes."

"Nishida-san. Yes."

"What if he says it can't be fixed?"

Tenchi's question carried unexpected weight—the child had been thinking about the Tsukino house's fate.

"Then we'll learn what 'can't be fixed' actually means. Sometimes impossible has smaller boundaries than we expect."

---

## SCENE 251-270 | Evening Routine
**Type:** Character Development/Subplot

The evening proceeded through its patterns. Bath, story, the bedtime ritual that marked daily completion.

Tonight the child slept with both tanuki and hero book beside the futon—the gifts maintaining their importance through proximity.

"Goodnight, Tenchi."

"Goodnight. Good luck tomorrow."

The child's awareness extending beyond his immediate concerns. Growth visible in small gestures.

---

## SCENE 271-299 | Night and Reflection
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The household settled. Tea on the engawa, the mountain's evening sounds filling the silence.

"You've prepared thoroughly."

"As thoroughly as I can without professional knowledge. Tomorrow reveals what I've missed."

"Tomorrow reveals what tomorrow reveals. Tonight, the preparation is complete."

---

Day twenty-four's reflection:

Themes processed:
- Pre-assessment anxiety (uncertainty about professional judgment)
- Preparation's limits (amateur versus expert knowledge)
- Documentation completed (questions compiled, access prepared)
- Structural concerns crystallized (main beam, multiple leak points)
- Household support (Tenchi's awareness, Katsuhito's wisdom)

The preparation felt complete. Whether completion would prove sufficient remained tomorrow's discovery.

Twenty-four days. The Tsukino house's future approaching its first professional assessment.
