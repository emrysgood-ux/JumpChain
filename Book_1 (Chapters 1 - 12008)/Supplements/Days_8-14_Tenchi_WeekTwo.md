# DAY 8 - APRIL 10, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **The Cart**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-030 | The Broken Wheel**
Grandpa's cart sat wrong. One side too low. The wheel was hurt.

"Grandpa, your cart is sick."

"The wheel needs repair."

The man looked at the wheel. His looking was different from Grandpa's looking. More like... studying. Like Tenchi with a new puzzle.

"I might be able to fix this," the man said.

Tenchi's heart went big. The man could fix things! Another good thing about him.

---

**SCENE 031-060 | Watching Work**
The man took the wheel off. His hands moved like they'd done this before, but he said he hadn't.

"Have you fixed wheels before?"

"No. But the broken part is here..." He pointed. "And I think I know what it needs."

Knowing without learning. Magic, maybe. But the man said it wasn't magic. It was skills coming when needed.

School time came before Tenchi could see more.

---

**SCENE 061-100 | School Thoughts**
Block building. Tenchi made a wheel shape. Round and round. The other kids made houses and towers.

"What's that?" Kenji asked.

"A wheel. Someone is fixing a wheel at my house."

"Who?"

"The new person. He has star-eyes and he can cook."

Kenji looked confused. Tenchi didn't explain more. Some things you had to see.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-150 | Coming Home**
The steps up. Faster today. Wanting to see.

The cart was... different. Still broken, but there was a piece of wood next to it. Cut and shaped.

"Did you fix it?"

"Part of it. I'll need proper tools. There's a metalworker in the village who can help."

Help from the village. The man was going to meet people. Going to become known.

---

**SCENE 151-200 | Evening Learning**
"The metalworker makes things from metal," Grandpa explained. "Yamada-san. He's helped our family for many years."

"Will he help Sheldon-san?"

"If asked properly."

Asking properly was important. Tenchi knew that. You had to use good words and good bowing.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-250 | Dinner Talk**
The man talked about the wheel. How the parts fit. Why it broke. What it needed.

Tenchi understood some parts. Not all. But the man explained like Tenchi was smart, not like he was little. That felt good.

"You're good at explaining."

"I used to teach. At a university."

"What's a university?"

"A school for grown-ups."

Grown-ups went to school too? The world was bigger than Tenchi thought.

---

**SCENE 251-299 | Night Thoughts**
The man taught grown-ups. He fixed wheels. He cooked best food. He had star-eyes.

Tenchi decided: the man was special. Not just nice—special.

Tomorrow maybe the wheel would be more fixed.

---

## DAY 8 COMPLETE

---

# DAY 9 - APRIL 11, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **Village Trip**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes)

## MORNING-AFTERNOON

The man went to the village with the wheel part. Tenchi wanted to go but had school.

"Will you come back?"

"Of course. I'm just going to see Yamada-san."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

School was forever long. Tenchi kept looking at the door like the man might appear there.

---

## AFTERNOON-EVENING

The man came back with stories. Yamada-san was old and grumpy but knew everything about metal. The wheel would be fixed proper now.

"He called you what?"

"The priest's helper. I suppose that's accurate."

Grandpa smiled. A small smile, but Tenchi saw it.

Dinner was curry. Tenchi had never had curry so good. The rice was perfect, the sauce was warm-spicy, and the vegetables were soft but not too soft.

"This is—"

"The best. I know." The man smiled.

## DAY 9 COMPLETE

---

# DAYS 10-14 SUMMARIES
## **Week Two Continues**

---

## DAY 10 (WEDNESDAY)

The garden had tiny green things poking up. Tenchi found them first.

"SHELDON-SAN! THE SEEDS ARE GROWING!"

The man came running. Not walking—running. Like the seeds mattered.

"Look at that. They're doing exactly what they're supposed to do."

"We helped them!"

"We gave them what they needed. They did the growing themselves."

Like people, Tenchi thought. Give them what they need, and they grow.

---

## DAY 11 (THURSDAY)

Rain again. The man worked inside, fixing a cabinet door that had been squeaky. The squeak was gone now.

Tenchi helped by holding things. A nail. A piece of cloth. Small jobs but real ones.

"You're a good helper."

"I want to be helpful."

"That's the most important thing—wanting to help."

---

## DAY 12 (FRIDAY)

The wheel came back from Yamada-san. The man put it on the cart. Everything fit.

Grandpa tested it. The cart rolled smooth and straight.

"Excellent work," Grandpa said.

The man looked happy but also surprised, like he hadn't been sure it would work. But it did. It worked because he fixed it.

---

## DAY 13 (SATURDAY)

Weekend! Tenchi attached himself to the man all day.

They cleaned the shrine together. They watered the growing seeds. They sat on the engawa and looked at clouds.

"That one looks like a tanuki."

"I see it. The round belly."

"And that one looks like a fish."

"Flying through the sky-ocean."

Sky-ocean. Tenchi liked that. The sky was like an upside-down ocean. Clouds were fish swimming through it.

---

## DAY 14 (SUNDAY)

Visitors again. More than last week. Spring weather brought people up the mountain.

The man stayed back, helping without being seen. Getting water, sweeping, making sure everything was ready.

After, Grandpa said, "He works well."

Tenchi nodded. Of course he did. He was the man with star-eyes who made best food and fixed wheels and explained things like Tenchi was smart.

Two weeks now. The man had been here two weeks.

Tenchi couldn't remember what before-the-man felt like. The man was part of things now. Part of the mountain. Part of home.
