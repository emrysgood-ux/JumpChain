## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
## **Weekend - Preparation and Patience**

---

### BATCH 1: Scenes 001-050 (04:30-08:30)
## **Pre-Dawn - Morning Routine - Saturday Rhythm**

---

## SCENE 001 | 04:35 | Main House - Guest Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Day twenty-seven. Saturday.

The weekend held different rhythm—Tenchi home from kindergarten, the household's patterns altered by continuous child presence.

The materials would arrive Tuesday. Until then, preparation work that required no specialized supplies.

---

## SCENE 002 | 04:39 | Main House - Guest Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The waiting between decision and execution created its own particular tension. The plan existed; the implementation awaited resources. The gap required patience—the discipline of deferred action.

Patience had never been natural. The previous existence had valued speed, rapid publication, immediate results. This existence taught different rhythms.

---

## SCENE 003 | 04:43 | Main House - Hallway
**Type:** Character Development

The hallway's darkness held its familiar quality—the same darkness, the same navigation, the twenty-seventh iteration of the same journey. The repetition had transformed from monotony to meditation. The familiar became foundation rather than limitation.

---

## SCENE 004 | 04:47 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen received him with its reliable welcome. Saturday breakfast often featured slight variations—the weekend permitting minor experiments, the household's leisure creating space for culinary exploration.

Today: something with eggs, the base reliable, the execution variable.

---

## SCENE 005 | 04:51 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Japanese breakfast eggs: tamagoyaki remained standard, but variations existed. Tamago kake gohan—raw egg over hot rice, the heat cooking the egg through contact. Onsen tamago—the slow-cooked egg with specific texture.

The techniques varied; the fundamental remained: protein, prepared with care, integrated into the meal's structure.

---

## SCENE 006 | 04:55 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Today's experiment: chawanmushi, the savory egg custard. Steamed rather than fried, requiring different equipment and timing. The technique new, the result uncertain.

The willingness to attempt the unfamiliar—another adaptation, another growth.

---

## SCENE 007 | 04:59 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The custard required precise egg-to-dashi ratio. His hands measured by feel now—the proportions internalized through weeks of practice.

The mixture achieved proper consistency. The steaming vessels prepared. The heat managed through observation rather than thermometer.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:03 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The cooking had become reliable satisfaction—the transformation of raw materials into nourishment, the visible results of invisible effort. The scientific precision of his previous existence translated into culinary execution.

The same drive toward understanding, different substrate.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:07 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The custards entered the steamer. The timing began—twelve minutes for proper set, the window narrow between undercooked and rubbery.

The other breakfast components assembled around the central experiment: rice, miso, pickled vegetables, simple fish.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:11 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Katsuhito's footsteps—the priest's morning emergence.

"An experiment this morning?"

"Chawanmushi. First attempt."

"First attempts teach the most."

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:15 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

"Success or failure, the learning has value."

"Indeed. Though edible success would be preferred."

The priest's slight smile acknowledged the practical concern beneath the philosophical comfort.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:19 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The timer approached completion. The steam rising, the eggs transforming through heat and humidity.

The moment of revelation approaching—had the technique been properly executed?

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:23 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The lid lifted. The custards emerged—smooth surface, proper color, the gentle wobble indicating correct texture.

The first attempt: successful. The relief disproportionate to the stakes.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:27 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Subplot

Small footsteps—Tenchi emerging earlier than weekday norm, the Saturday freedom altering sleep patterns.

"Good morning! Is that something new?"

"Chawanmushi. Egg custard. Have you had it before?"

"Mama made it sometimes."

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:31 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The invocation of Kiyone settled differently on Saturday morning—the casual mention, the child's memory accessed without distress.

The healing continued through accumulation of normal moments.

"I hope mine compares adequately."

---

## SCENE 016-050 | Breakfast and Morning Activities
**Type:** Main Plot/Worldbuilding/Character Development

Breakfast proceeded with the chawanmushi receiving prominent position. The taste test: successful. The texture proper. The technique validated.

"This is good, Sheldon-san. Like Mama's but different."

"Different isn't wrong."

"No. Different is interesting."

The child's developing palate—the capacity to distinguish quality while accepting variation. Growth visible in small observations.

Saturday morning unfolded through its particular rhythms: household chores distributed, the shrine receiving attention, Tenchi's energy requiring outlet through supervised activity.

The Zen garden work continued, the child participating where appropriate. Small hands learning to rake gravel, the patterns emerging through patient repetition.

"Why do we make lines?"

"The lines create patterns. The patterns create peace."

"Peace from lines?"

"Peace from attention. The lines just show where the attention went."

### BATCH 2: Scenes 051-100 (08:34-12:00)
## **Late Morning - Tsukino House Preparation**

---

## SCENE 051-075 | Preparation Without Materials
**Type:** Main Plot/Character Development

The Tsukino house received them mid-morning—Tenchi accompanying, the safe areas available for exploration while work proceeded in accessible zones.

The temporary support positions marked. The waterproofing locations identified. The preparation work that required no specialized supplies completed through available resources.

The clearing continued: debris removed from work areas, access paths widened, the staging zones for Tuesday's materials established.

"What are you doing?"

"Making space for the things that will arrive Tuesday."

"The fixing things?"

"The fixing things."

---

## SCENE 076-100 | Lunch and Continued Work
**Type:** Subplot/Worldbuilding

Lunch at the Tsukino house—onigiri packed from morning's rice, the portable meal enabling continuous presence.

Tenchi explored the garden while Sheldon continued preparation. The overgrown space held wonders for a five-year-old: hidden paths, forgotten structures, the archaeology of neglected property.

"There's a pond!"

"A dried pond. It probably had fish once."

"Can we put fish back?"

"Eventually. After the house is fixed, the garden comes next."

The vision expanding: not just a house restored but a property reclaimed. The project growing in scope through articulation.

## **Afternoon - Family Time - Village Walk**

---

## SCENE 101-150 | Afternoon at Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot/Relationship

The afternoon return to the shrine brought the household together for the weekend's particular leisure. The shrine's Saturday visitors—few but present—received proper attention.

Tenchi's role as greeter continued developing: the child welcoming visitors with practiced phrases, the performance improving through repetition.

"Welcome to Masaki Shrine. Please enjoy your visit."

The formality charming from a five-year-old. The visitors responded with appropriate appreciation.

Sheldon observed from appropriate distance—the child's integration into shrine life progressing, the sense of purpose building through contribution.

---

## SCENE 151-200 | Late Afternoon Walk
**Type:** Worldbuilding/Character Development

The late afternoon brought a family walk—the three-person household descending toward the village, the Saturday tradition establishing itself.

The walk provided opportunity for village interaction without commercial purpose. Greetings exchanged, weather discussed, the social maintenance that small communities required.

"Tsukino-san, the materials are confirmed for Tuesday."

Mrs. Tanaka's voice from her store's entrance.

"Thank you. I'll be ready to receive them."

"Good luck with the work. Masaru would be pleased."

The community's investment in the restoration extending beyond practical assistance. The previous owner's memory preserved through the current owner's efforts.

---

## SCENE 201-250 | Dinner and Evening
**Type:** Main Plot/Subplot

Saturday dinner held slight festivity—the weekend's different rhythm permitting expanded effort. The meal more elaborate than weekday norm, the time investment justified by availability.

Tenchi's contribution: setting the table with increasing precision, the placement of dishes approaching proper form.

"Very good. The chopsticks are correctly positioned."

"I practiced."

"Practice shows."

The household operating as unit, each member contributing within capacity, the collaboration creating something beyond individual capability.

---

## SCENE 251-270 | Evening Activities
**Type:** Character Development/Relationship

The evening extended past weekday limits—Saturday permitting later bedtime, the household gathered around shared activities.

The hero book received attention: Tenchi reading aloud with assistance, the words still challenging but the effort genuine.

"Very good. Keep going."

The literacy building through practice, the stories becoming accessible through accumulated skill.

---

## SCENE 271-299 | Night and Reflection
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The household settled toward sleep. The Saturday complete, the Sunday approaching.

Tea on the engawa, the mountain's evening sounds surrounding the shared silence.
