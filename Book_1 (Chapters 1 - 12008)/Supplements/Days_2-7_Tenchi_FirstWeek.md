# DAYS 2-7 - APRIL 4-9, 1989 (TUE-SUN)
## MASAKI TENCHI POV (Age 4)
## **Week One: The New Person**

---

## ABOUT TENCHI'S POV

Tenchi is four years old, turning five on April 24th. His POV scenes are shorter (60-100 words typical), reflecting a child's attention span and concrete thinking. His observations are immediate, physical, and emotional rather than analytical.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Simple vocabulary
- Present-moment focus
- Physical descriptions ("the tall tree," "the warm blanket")
- Questions as primary mode of engagement
- Emotional immediacy without adult rationalization
- Concrete rather than abstract thinking

# DAY 2 - APRIL 4, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **The Man Who Makes Breakfast**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes - shorter format)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001 | Waking Up**
The sunlight made patterns on the ceiling. Tenchi watched them move. Yesterday there was a new person. Was he still here?

---

**SCENE 002 | Listening**
Sounds from the kitchen. Not Grandpa sounds—different. The new person was still here. His tummy felt happy. The new person had made good dinner.

---

**SCENE 003 | Getting Up**
His feet touched the cold floor. Jump fast to the tatami! The game every morning. Cold floor lost again.

---

**SCENE 004-010 | Morning Routine**
Bathroom. Face washing. The water was cold but Grandpa said it woke up sleepy faces. His face didn't feel sleepy. His face felt curious.

Clothes. The blue shirt because blue was best. Pants with the pockets because pockets held important things.

Walking to the kitchen. The smells got bigger. Rice and something else. Something good.

---

**SCENE 011-020 | Breakfast Discovery**
The new person stood at the counter. He was tall. Not as tall as Papa, but tall.

"Good morning."

The man's voice was nice. Not too loud, not scary.

"Good morning." Tenchi looked at the food. "What's that?"

"Tamagoyaki. It's like egg but rolled up."

Rolled up eggs? Eggs couldn't roll. But when Tenchi looked, there it was. Yellow and rolled like a tiny sleeping bag.

---

**SCENE 021-040 | Eating**
The rolled egg was good. Really good. Better than Grandpa's eggs, but Tenchi wouldn't say that because it might make Grandpa sad.

"You like it?"

Tenchi nodded, mouth full.

The man smiled. His eyes had little sparkly parts. Silver, like stars in brown sky.

"Your eyes have stars."

The man touched his face, surprised. "Do they?"

"A little bit. It's nice."

---

**SCENE 041-080 | After Breakfast**
School today. Tenchi didn't want to go. He wanted to watch the new person.

"Will you be here when I come back?"

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Promises were important. Mama had promised to stay and then she couldn't. But this promise felt different. The man looked like he meant it.

---

**SCENE 081-100 | School Walk Thoughts**
The steps down the mountain. Three hundred and twenty, Grandpa said. Tenchi didn't count them all but he knew they were many.

"Grandpa, who is the man?"

"His name is Sheldon. He's staying with us for a while."

"Forever?"

"We'll see."

'We'll see' usually meant 'probably not.' Tenchi's tummy felt sad.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-120 | School (Brief)**
School was the same. Blocks. Crayons. Snack. Nap time but Tenchi didn't sleep, just lay there thinking about the man with star-eyes who made rolled eggs.

---

**SCENE 121-160 | Coming Home**
The steps up the mountain. Three hundred and twenty. More tired going up.

"Grandpa, is he still there?"

"He's working on the grounds."

Working! The man worked. That meant he was helping. People who helped got to stay.

---

**SCENE 161-200 | Finding the Man**
The shrine looked cleaner. The paths were swept. The man was near the stone lantern, wiping it carefully.

"Hi!"

The man turned. Smiled. "Hi, Tenchi. How was school?"

"Boring. I thought about your eyes instead."

A laugh. Not mean-laugh, nice-laugh. "That's an interesting thing to think about."

"Can I help?"

"There's another cloth. You could wipe the lower parts."

Helping! Tenchi took the cloth. It was wet and smelled like wood. He wiped very carefully. This was important work.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-240 | Dinner**
More good food. Something with fish that tasted like the ocean but nice.

Grandpa said, "This is excellent."

The man said, "Thank you."

Tenchi said, "Can you cook forever?"

Both grown-ups smiled. Tenchi didn't know why it was funny, but he smiled too.

---

**SCENE 241-270 | Before Bed**
"Grandpa, I like him."

"The guest? Sheldon-san?"

"Yeah. He's nice."

Grandpa was quiet for a moment. "He seems nice, yes."

"Can he stay?"

"We'll see."

There it was again. 'We'll see.' But it sounded different this time. Less like 'probably not' and more like 'maybe.'

---

**SCENE 271-299 | Sleeping**
The futon was warm. The ceiling patterns were dark now. The house had its night sounds: Grandpa walking, the wind outside, the little creaks that houses made.

And somewhere, the new person was sleeping too. In the guest room.

Tomorrow there would be more rolled eggs.

Tomorrow the man would still be there.

Tenchi closed his eyes and felt happy.

# DAY 3 - APRIL 5, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## **Learning His Name**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-020 | Morning Routine**
Up. Cold floor. Tatami victory. Bathroom. Blue shirt (blue still best). Run to kitchen.

The man was there again. Good.

"Good morning, Tenchi."

"Good morning, Sheldon-san." The name felt big in his mouth. "Shell-don. That's weird."

"It's American."

"What's American?"

"A country far away. Across the ocean."

The ocean was big. Tenchi had seen it once with Papa. You couldn't see the other side.

"How far?"

"Very, very far. Farther than you can imagine."

Tenchi tried to imagine. His imagining made it seem impossible. "Did you swim?"

---

**SCENE 021-050 | Breakfast Questions**
Rolled eggs again. Still good. Maybe better?

"Did you always live across the ocean?"

"Most of my life."

"Do you miss it?"

The man thought about this. Really thought, not pretend-thought like grown-ups sometimes did.

"Some parts. But I like it here too."

"Me too. I like it here. The mountain is good."

---

**SCENE 051-100 | Morning Walk**
School walk with Grandpa. The man waved from the engawa as they left.

"Grandpa, why did he come here?"

"He needed a place to stay."

"Why?"

"Sometimes people need help finding where they belong."

"Is he finding it?"

"Perhaps."

Tenchi thought about this on the steps down. Finding where you belong. He belonged here, with Grandpa, with Papa when Papa visited. Maybe the man was finding he belonged here too.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-150 | School (Brief)**
Blocks. Story time. The story was about a tanuki who played tricks. Tenchi liked tanuki. They were funny but not mean.

Nap time. Still didn't sleep. Thought about the man finding where he belonged.

---

**SCENE 151-200 | Coming Home**
The steps up. The man was doing something new—working in the garden. Dirt on his hands, on his knees.

"What are you doing?"

"Planting vegetables."

"Can I help?"

"There's a small trowel. You could dig holes."

Digging holes! The best job. Tenchi dug and dug. The dirt smelled like... like dirt. Rich and dark and alive.

"How deep?"

"About that much." The man showed with his fingers. "For the seeds to feel safe."

Seeds needed to feel safe. Tenchi understood. Everyone needed to feel safe.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-240 | Dinner**
Something new. The man called it "miso." It was soup, but warm in a special way. Warm inside, like hugs.

"I like this."

"I'm glad."

---

**SCENE 241-270 | Stars**
After dinner, the man sat on the engawa looking at the sky.

"What are you looking at?"

"The stars."

Tenchi looked too. So many little lights. "Which one is your home?"

The man was quiet. "I don't know anymore."

"That's sad."

"A little. But maybe home is here now."

---

**SCENE 271-299 | Sleeping**
The man didn't know which star was his home. That was very sad. But he said maybe home was here now.

Tenchi decided: he would make sure the man felt like this was home.

Tomorrow he would help more.

## DAY 3 COMPLETE - TENCHI POV

# DAYS 4-7 - APRIL 6-9, 1989 (THU-SUN)
## **The Week Continues**

---

## DAY 4 (THURSDAY) - Summary

The man made fish for breakfast. It was salty and good.

School happened. Tenchi counted how many steps until he could come home. Too many.

The man showed him how seeds grew. First they were seeds, then they pushed up, then they became plants. Magic but not magic—the man said it was "science."

"What's science?"

"Asking how things work and finding out."

"I like science."

---

## DAY 5 (FRIDAY) - Summary

Rain. The mountain made rain sounds all day. Tenchi couldn't go outside much.

The man fixed something on the engawa. A loose board. He used a hammer, careful and slow.

"Can I try?"

"When you're a bit older. Hammers are heavy."

Heavy like important. Tenchi watched. The man's hands knew exactly what to do.

"How do you know how to do that?"

"I'm not sure. It just... comes to me."

Things that came to people. Like ideas, but in hands.

---

## DAY 6 (SATURDAY) - Summary

Weekend. No school! Tenchi followed the man around like a small shadow.

The shrine got cleaned. Tenchi helped with the easy parts. The man did the hard parts.

"Grandpa says the shrine is old."

"Very old. That's why we take care of it."

"Old things need more care?"

"Old things have been through more. They deserve attention."

Grandpa was old. The shrine was old. Maybe that's why Tenchi loved them—they had been through things and deserved attention.

---

## DAY 7 (SUNDAY) - Summary

Sunday visitors came to the shrine. People from the village and farther. Tenchi helped welcome them—bowing, smiling, being a good shrine boy.

The man helped too, but stayed back. He said he didn't want to confuse people.

"Why would they be confused?"

"I'm new. They know your grandfather, but they don't know me yet."

"They'll know you soon."

"I hope so."

After the visitors left, they had onigiri. The man made them. The rice was perfect, the nori crispy, the filling exactly right.

"These are the best onigiri."

"You say that about everything I make."

"Because everything you make is the best."

The man laughed. Tenchi laughed too. The mountain felt happy.
