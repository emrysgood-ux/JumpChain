# DAYS 2-7 - APRIL 4-9, 1989 (TUE-SUN)
## MASAKI TENCHI POV (Age 4)
## **The New Person**

---

**POV Note:** Tenchi is four years old. His scenes are shorter, his attention more fragmented, his understanding filtered through a child's perspective. Internal reflection is limited; sensory experience and immediate emotion dominate.

---

# DAY 2 - APRIL 4, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **Second Day with the Stranger**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes, child-length ~60-100 words each)

## WAKING (Scenes 001-030)

The new person was still here.

Tenchi had wondered if he would be gone by morning—people sometimes left when he slept. Mama had left that way, though Ojii-san said she hadn't meant to.

But the new person was in the kitchen making breakfast smells.

Good smells. Different from Ojii-san's cooking. The new person's food was better. Tenchi liked it.

---

The rice was perfect. The eggs made that special rolled shape. There was soup with the green onions from the garden.

"Good morning, Tenchi-kun."

"Good morning." He looked at the new person's eyes. "Your eyes have stars in them."

"You mentioned that yesterday."

"They're still there."

---

## BREAKFAST AND SCHOOL WALK (Scenes 031-060)

The food tasted like someone had paid attention. Like it mattered that he would eat it.

Tenchi ate everything. The eggs especially. They were soft and sweet and rolled up tight.

"How do you make them so round?"

"Practice. And patience."

"Can I learn?"

"When you're a little bigger."

---

Ojii-san walked him down the steps. The new person stayed behind. Tenchi looked back twice to make sure he was still on the engawa.

He was.

"Will he be there when I come back?"

"He'll be there."

"Promise?"

"He'll be there, Tenchi."

---

## SCHOOL (Scenes 061-120)

School was the same as always. The teachers. The other children. The songs and the games and the counting.

But Tenchi's mind kept going back to the mountain. To the new person with stars in his eyes. To the breakfast that tasted like it meant something.

"Tenchi-kun? Are you paying attention?"

"Yes, sensei."

He wasn't. Not really.

---

The other children didn't have new people at their houses. They had mamas and papas and brothers and sisters. Regular people who had always been there.

Tenchi had Ojii-san. And now maybe he had someone else too.

The thought felt warm. Like the eggs.

---

## RETURN (Scenes 121-180)

The walk up the steps was always long. Three hundred twenty steps that made his legs tired.

But today the new person was at the top. He had water ready.

"The steps are many for small legs."

"I'm not small!"

"Of course not. The steps are many for any legs."

---

The water was cold and good. The new person waited while Tenchi caught his breath.

"What did you do today?"

"Helped Ojii-san. Worked in the garden."

"What did you plant?"

"I don't know the names. Green things."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 181-250)

Dinner was as good as breakfast. Different food but the same careful attention.

Tenchi watched the new person eat. He ate slowly, like he was thinking about each bite.

"Do you like it?"

"Very much."

"Did you make it for yourself too, or just for us?"

The question seemed to surprise the new person.

"I made it for everyone."

---

Bath time came after dinner. Then stories. Then bed.

The new person stayed in the main room while Ojii-san read the story. Tenchi could see him through the doorway, sitting quietly, not interrupting.

Like he belonged there but knew not to push.

---

## BEDTIME (Scenes 251-299)

The futon was warm. The story was good. Ojii-san's voice made everything safe.

But Tenchi's last thought before sleep wasn't about the story.

It was about the new person. About whether he would still be there tomorrow.

He hoped so. He hoped very much.

---

**Day 2 Summary (Tenchi POV):**
- Confirmed new person stayed overnight
- Breakfast established as special
- School day distracted by thoughts of home
- Evening interaction comfortable
- Attachment forming

# DAY 3 - APRIL 5, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## **Learning His Name**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

The new person had a name. Tenchi knew this. Sheldon-san. But the name felt strange in his mouth.

"Sher-don-san?"

"Close enough. You can call me what feels comfortable."

"Sheldon-san."

The second try was better. The name started to fit.

---

Breakfast again exceeded anything Ojii-san had made. The new person—Sheldon-san—was doing something different with the food. Making it more.

"Why is your food better?"

"Better than what?"

"Better than Ojii-san's."

The pause before answering. Adults always paused when the question was interesting.

"I don't know. It just comes out this way."

---

## SCHOOL (Scenes 101-150)

The teacher asked what everyone had for breakfast.

"Rice and eggs and soup," Tenchi said. "Sheldon-san made it."

"Who is Sheldon-san?"

"The new person at our house."

The teacher's face did something complicated. Adults' faces often did that when Tenchi said true things.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-220)

Home again. The steps again. Sheldon-san at the top again.

But today was different. Today Sheldon-san was dirty.

"What happened?"

"Gardening. Your grandfather and I planted things."

"Your face has mud on it."

Sheldon-san touched his cheek. Found the mud. Smiled.

"So it does."

---

The garden looked different. Lines in the dirt. Seeds underneath, Sheldon-san said. Things that would grow into food.

"Can I help tomorrow?"

"If your grandfather approves."

"He'll approve. He likes when I help."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 221-299)

Dinner included something from the garden—the onions again, but also leaves Tenchi didn't recognize.

"From the wild patch," Sheldon-san said. "They're safe. They taste like spring."

They did. Green and alive and new.

---

The bedtime story was about a rabbit. Tenchi listened but kept watching the doorway. Sheldon-san was there again, sitting quietly.

The same place. The same patience.

Like he was becoming part of the house.

---

**Day 3 Summary (Tenchi POV):**
- Name practiced and becoming familiar
- School awareness of household change
- Garden observation
- Attachment deepening

---

# DAY 4 - APRIL 6, 1989 (THURSDAY)
## **Helping**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

Ojii-san said yes. Tenchi could help in the garden.

The work was hard but Sheldon-san showed him how to hold the small seeds, how to place them in the holes, how to cover them gently.

"Not too deep. They need to find the light."

"How do they find it?"

"They know. Plants always know which way is up."

---

The dirt got under his fingernails. His knees got sore from kneeling. But the work felt important. Like he was making something that would keep existing after he stopped.

"Will they grow big?"

"Some of them. The ones that want to."

"Do plants want things?"

"In their way. They want light and water and good soil. Like you want food and sleep and stories."

---

## SCHOOL (Scenes 101-150)

His hands were clean but he could still feel the garden. The texture of seeds. The weight of soil.

"What are you thinking about, Tenchi-kun?"

"Seeds."

The teacher waited for more, but there wasn't more. Just seeds.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-220)

More garden work. Different section. Different seeds.

Sheldon-san worked beside him, matching his pace. Not rushing, not leaving him behind.

"You're patient."

"Patience is the garden's first lesson."

Tenchi wasn't sure what that meant. But it sounded true.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 221-299)

The bath was necessary. The dirt had gotten everywhere.

"You worked hard today."

"I helped."

"You helped very much."

Ojii-san's approval felt good. But Sheldon-san's earlier thanks felt good too. Two kinds of good.

---

**Day 4 Summary (Tenchi POV):**
- First real contribution to household work
- Gardening partnership established
- Pride in helping developing
- Dual approval recognized

---

# DAYS 5-7 - APRIL 7-9, 1989 (FRI-SUN)
## **Weekend Settling**

---

### COMBINED SCENE SUMMARY (897 scenes condensed)

## FRIDAY (Day 5)

School ended for the week. Two whole days with Sheldon-san and Ojii-san.

The afternoon brought more garden work. Tenchi's hands remembered the motions from yesterday. The seeds went in easier. The covering went faster.

"You're learning."

"I remembered."

"Remembering is the beginning of learning."

---

Dinner was fish. The special kind Sheldon-san made better than anyone.

"Where did you learn to cook?"

The pause again. The interesting-question pause.

"I don't know. It just happens."

"Magic?"

A longer pause.

"Maybe. I'm not sure."

---

## SATURDAY (Day 6)

No school. The whole day on the mountain.

Sheldon-san was working on something else today. The old house past the garden. The one nobody had lived in for a long time.

"What are you doing?"

"Looking. Learning what the house needs."

"Is it sick?"

"In a way. Houses get sick when no one takes care of them."

"Will you make it better?"

"I'm going to try."

---

Tenchi watched the looking. The careful way Sheldon-san touched walls and looked at ceilings and wrote things down.

"You're a doctor for houses."

The smile that earned was wide and real.

"I hadn't thought of it that way. But yes. Something like that."

---

## SUNDAY (Day 7)

The first full week was ending. Tenchi counted the days on his fingers—seven since Sheldon-san came.

Seven days of better food. Seven days of gardening help. Seven days of someone new in the house.

"Are you staying?"

"For a while."

"How long is a while?"

"I don't know yet."

---

The not-knowing should have worried him. But Sheldon-san said it honestly, like he would tell the truth if he knew it.

"I want you to stay."

"I know. I want to stay too."

"Then stay."

"I will. For as long as I can."

---

The evening brought dinner and stories and the familiar comfort of bedtime.

But the familiar had changed. There was a new person in it now. A person who cooked and gardened and looked at sick houses. A person with stars in his eyes and no lies in his voice.

Tenchi fell asleep thinking about the garden. About the seeds underneath. About things that grew when someone took care of them.
