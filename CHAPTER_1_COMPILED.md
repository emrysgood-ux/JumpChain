The sky was blue.

That was the first thing. Blue, interrupted by white — clouds, his mind supplied, before he'd decided to think. Cumulus. Fair weather clouds. The kind that meant no rain.

He was cataloging. He noticed himself doing it and couldn't stop. The blue was deep, almost cobalt where the clouds didn't reach. The white was pure, edges well-defined. The light suggested mid-afternoon, sun past zenith, probably forty-five degrees above the horizon based on the brightness in his peripheral vision.

He was lying on his back. That came next. Something prickly-soft beneath him — grass, his hands confirmed without his permission, fingers curling into it. Cool earth under that. The smell of green things and damp soil and something sweet he couldn't name.

A bird called.

Three notes. Clear as struck crystal. Rising, clipping short, falling away. *Ho-hokekyo.* He didn't know the bird. Had never heard that particular call. But something in him — something older than the part that cataloged cloud types — recognized it anyway.

*Spring,* his body said. *You're alive, and it's spring.*

The thought should have been reassuring. Instead it sent ice through his chest, because the last thing he remembered was dying.


The cascade failure. The containment breach. Maria's face through the observation window, her mouth open in a scream he couldn't hear over the alarms. The light — not light, *energy* — expanding outward from the focal point, and in that final fraction of a second, the absolute certainty that there was no time to run, no time to shield, no time for anything at all.

He had died.

He remembered dying.

And now he was lying in a field, looking at clouds, listening to a bird he didn't recognize, and his heart was beating steady and strong in a chest that didn't hurt at all.

Sheldon sat up.

The motion came easier than it should have. No catch in his lower back — the familiar twinge that had been his companion for fifteen years, absent. His hands pressed into the grass to push himself upright, and they moved without the morning stiffness in his knuckles that he'd learned to expect. He looked at them.

Wrong. They were wrong.

The shape was his. The length of the fingers, the particular curve of the thumb, the way the tendons moved under skin — all recognizably *his*. But the skin was too smooth. Too young. And the scar on his right thumb — the paring knife, Grandmother's kitchen, eight years old and learning to peel apples — was gone.

He turned his hand over. Traced the place where the scar should be. Smooth. Unmarked. As if it had never happened.

*As if he had never happened.*

The bird called again. *Ho-hokekyo.* Somewhere to his left, hidden in trees he was only now noticing. A treeline, thirty or forty meters away. Green leaves and — 

Pink.

A tree covered in pale pink blossoms, so thick they nearly obscured the branches. Petals drifting down like snow, carpeting the dark earth beneath. Cherry blossoms. *Sakura.* The word surfaced from somewhere, from the years in Kyoto that suddenly felt very far away.

Cherry blossoms meant spring. Early April, in most of Japan. Peak bloom.

He was in Japan.

The realization settled into him with strange weight. The vegetation was right. The quality of the light. The bird call — Japanese, probably, though he'd never studied ornithology. And when he looked beyond the cherry tree to the horizon, he saw low mountains with the particular silhouette of the Japanese countryside, the kind of view he'd seen a hundred times during his postdoc years.

But his postdoc had been in 2010. And he had died in 2025. In Alaska. In a particle physics laboratory that was probably a smoking crater now.

*Think,* he told himself. *You're a scientist. Observe. Catalog. Hypothesize.*

He looked down at himself.

Gray slacks. Single pleat, no cuffs. Well-fitted. White button-down shirt, slightly rumpled from lying in grass but clean. Black leather belt. The clothes were not his — he'd been wearing a lab coat over a Stanford t-shirt when—

He stopped that thought. Filed it away. Kept cataloging.

He patted his pockets. Left trouser: coins, jingling. Right trouser: nothing. Back right: a wallet, he realized, pulling it free. Brown leather. Worn at the edges. Not his wallet — his had been newer, bought at a Target in Berkeley when the old one finally fell apart.

He opened it.

Cash. A lot of it — Japanese yen, he recognized the Fukuzawa Yukichi portrait on the ten-thousand note. Three of those. More in smaller denominations. A coin pouch built into the wallet, heavy with change.

A card in a plastic sleeve. He pulled it out.

An ID. His face — *his* face, unmistakably — in a small photograph. But younger. The face he remembered from his thirties, not the one he'd seen in the mirror the morning he died. Text in Japanese, which he read with surprising ease — the characters sharp and clear in his mind, the grammar parsing itself without the hesitation he'd grown used to in the years since Kyoto. His Japanese shouldn't be this fluent. It had been fifteen years. But the words resolved themselves anyway, and he added it to his growing list.

外国人登録証明書. Alien Registration Certificate.

Name: 月野 シェルドン. *Tsukino Sheldon.*

Nationality: アメリカ合衆国. United States of America.

Date of Birth: 1959年3月15日. March 15, 1959.

Status of Residence: 永住者. Permanent Resident.

Date of Registration: 1987年4月.

He stared at the card for a long time.

His name was not Tsukino. His birthday was not March 15, 1959 — it was November 3, 1978. He had never held Japanese permanent residency. And he had certainly not registered anywhere in April of 1987, because in April of 1987 he had been nine years old and living in Marietta, Georgia, still two years away from losing his father to an industrial accident.

And yet.

The face in the photograph was his face. The card looked genuine — proper materials, official stamps, the particular texture of government-issued documents. If this was a forgery, it was flawless.

His hands were shaking. He noticed that with the same detached observation he'd been applying to everything else. Tremor in the fingers. Elevated heart rate — though still steady, still stronger than he remembered it being. Symptoms of shock, probably. Reasonable, under the circumstances.

He kept going through the wallet.

More documents. A folded paper — *koseki*, family registry excerpt, he recognized the format from his Kyoto years. It showed a family he'd never heard of. Tsukino Takeo, deceased 1978. Tsukino Sachiko, deceased 1985. And Tsukino Sheldon, born 1959, status: living.

A photograph, wallet-sized. An elderly woman in kimono. A middle-aged man in work clothes. A woman in a simple dress. A young man who looked... 

He held the photo closer.

The young man in the photograph looked like him. Or like a version of him. The resemblance was unmistakable — same bone structure, same set of the eyes. But he had never taken this photograph. Had never worn those clothes. Had never stood in front of that house with those people.

Had never had a family called Tsukino.

A letter, folded. He didn't read it yet. Two bankbooks — one for a regional bank, one for postal savings. Both in the name Tsukino Sheldon. Both showing balances that added up to more money than he'd ever had in savings at any point in his previous life.

*Previous life.*

The phrase echoed in his mind. He let it sit there. Didn't examine it too closely. Not yet.

He put the wallet back together. Returned it to his pocket. Stood up.

His body moved like a well-maintained machine. No aches. No stiffness. No familiar complaints. His vision was sharp — sharper than it had been since he was twelve years old and got his first pair of glasses. He could see individual leaves on the cherry tree. Could count the petals falling.

He wasn't wearing glasses. He should have been wearing glasses.

Sheldon looked around.

The field stretched maybe sixty meters long, fifty wide. Fallow — grass and wildflowers growing where crops had once been planted, the ghost of paddy ridges still visible under the vegetation. A low stone wall to the south, partially collapsed. The treeline to the north, with the cherry tree standing slightly apart like a sentinel. To the west, the land rose toward forested hills. To the east, it descended toward more fields, and beyond them — far off — hints of buildings. A village.

No people. No sounds of machinery. No aircraft overhead. Just wind in the grass, birds in the trees, and his own breathing.

He looked at the ID card again. The address field showed characters he could read: Okayama Prefecture. A town name. A specific location.

But reading an address and knowing where it was were two different things. He had no map. No familiarity with this area. And whoever or whatever had placed him here had apparently not seen fit to include a GPS — not that such a thing existed, if the registration date on his ID was any indication.

*1987. The card says I registered in 1987.*

He looked at the sun. At the vegetation. At the style of the clothes he was wearing.

*What year is it?*

The question opened a pit in his stomach. He filed it with the others. Kept moving.

He needed to find people. People could tell him where he was, what year it was, how to reach the address on his ID. People meant water, food, shelter — Grandmother's voice, suddenly clear in his mind: *First you survive. Then you figure out the rest.*

He looked south, toward the stone wall and, beyond it, the suggestion of more fields descending toward lower ground. East, where he'd seen the distant buildings. West, where the land rose into forest.

Roads were usually in valleys, not on hillsides. Villages were built where the land was flat, where water gathered, where farming was easiest. If he walked downhill — south and east — he'd eventually find a road. And roads led to people.

He started walking.

The grass whispered against his slacks as he moved. His shoes — black oxfords, comfortable, broken-in like he'd been wearing them for years — made soft sounds on the uneven ground. A butterfly crossed his path, yellow and erratic, and he watched it until it disappeared into the treeline.

At the stone wall, he paused. Looked back at the field where he'd awakened. The grass was still pressed flat where he'd lain. In an hour, maybe two, it would spring back. There would be no evidence he'd ever been there.

The cherry tree shed another handful of petals. They drifted down like pink snow, settling on the dark earth.

He turned away and climbed over the wall.


The next field was similar to the first — fallow, overgrown, the bones of old rice paddies visible under the wild grass. He crossed it, then another. The land sloped gently downward, confirming his guess about the terrain.

After fifteen minutes of walking, he saw the road.

It appeared as a gray line cutting through the green — pavement, cracked and weathered by years of use. Barely wide enough for a single car. No markings, no signs visible from this distance. But it was a road. It went somewhere.

Sheldon quickened his pace, ignoring the mild burn in his calves that was the first hint his body had any limits at all. His throat was dry. His stomach, now that he was paying attention, felt hollow. He didn't know when this body had last eaten or drunk, but apparently it needed to do both soon.

He reached the road and stood at its edge. Pavement warm under his feet, sun-baked, holding the afternoon heat. It curved away in both directions — west, back toward the mountains; east, toward lower ground and, presumably, civilization.

East, then. Toward the valley. Toward the village he'd glimpsed from the field.

He started walking.

The road was quiet. No traffic, no engine sounds, no noise but his own footsteps and the wind. Power lines ran along one side — wooden poles, ceramic insulators, the kind of rural infrastructure that hadn't changed much since the mid-century. Confirmation, if he needed it, that he wasn't in a city.

His shadow stretched out in front of him, long in the afternoon light. He watched it move and tried not to think about the fact that he shouldn't have a shadow at all. Shouldn't have a body to cast one.

*Who?* The question surfaced again. *Who could do this? Who would do this?*

No answer. He kept walking.

A sound behind him — engine noise, growing closer. He stepped to the side of the narrow road and turned.

A small white truck appeared around the curve. A kei truck, his mind supplied — the compact utility vehicles that were everywhere in rural Japan. It was slowing down.

The truck pulled alongside him and stopped. The driver's window was already down. An older man peered out — sixties, maybe, weathered face, work clothes, a cap with some agricultural company logo. His eyes took in Sheldon's appearance with frank curiosity.

"You lost?" the man asked in Japanese. The Okayama dialect, Sheldon noted — longer vowels, softer consonants than the Tokyo standard he'd learned.

"I'm looking for—" Sheldon pulled out his ID card, showed the address. "Can you tell me how to get here?"

The man squinted at the card. His eyebrows rose. "Tsukino? Near Masaki Shrine?" He looked at Sheldon again, reassessing. "You family?"

"Yes," Sheldon said. The lie came easily. It was on the documents, after all.

The man nodded slowly. "That's a ways from here. You'd need to take the bus from the stop up ahead." He jerked his thumb eastward. "I can give you a ride that far, if you want. Heading that direction anyway."

"Thank you," Sheldon said. "I would appreciate that."

The man reached over and pushed open the passenger door. Sheldon climbed in.

The cab smelled of fertilizer and tobacco and something else — warm vinyl, maybe, baked by years of sun. An omamori charm hung from the rearview mirror, faded red and gold. The radio was silent, the dashboard simple and worn.

"Yamamoto," the man said, not quite looking at him. "Yamamoto Takeshi."

"Tsukino Sheldon." The name still felt strange in his mouth. But the man nodded as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

The truck pulled back onto the road, and Sheldon watched the fields slide past, and tried to remember how to breathe.


**SCENE 1 — END**

**Word Count:** ~2,500 words

**Time Elapsed (Story):** ~50 minutes (2:47 PM to ~3:37 PM)

**Sheldon's Current State:**
- Physical: Good; mild thirst, mild hunger beginning
- Emotional: Shock, disorientation, controlled panic sublimated into action
- Knowledge: Knows he's in Japan, in spring (probably). Has seen documents but hasn't fully processed them. Has now made first human contact.

**Open Threads Planted:**
- The missing scar (body has been changed)
- The Tsukino identity (who created this?)
- The two-year gap (ID says registered 1987, he has no memory)
- The bird call (will recur as sensory anchor)
- The cherry tree (will recur as location/memory)
- Japanese fluency shouldn't be this good (restoration clue)
- Vision shouldn't be this good (restoration clue)
- Yamamoto's omamori (Masaki Shrine connection)

**Next Scene:** Bus stop wait, boarding Line 47, ride to Jinja-mae


**POST-SCENE AUDIT:**

Forbidden words check: No instances of Cosmos, Sailor, Ryoko, Washu, Tsunami, Kagato, Ayeka, Sasami, Jurai, Royal Tree, Galaxy Police, Phase I/II/III, "remade," or Lambda in Sheldon's POV.

POV Discipline: All information is either directly perceived by Sheldon or reasonably inferred from perception.

Period Authenticity: No anachronistic technology or attitudes.

Emotional Realism: Sheldon is in shock but functioning — appropriate for a scientist trained to observe and analyze under pressure.

Law 21 Compliance: Japanese fluency written as CURRENT ability with SURPRISE at ease, not as past-life limitation.

Geography: Correct — field near Harada, walks to road, Yamamoto gives ride to bus stop. Does NOT see shrine yet.

The bus stop was nothing more than a wooden bench under a tin roof, set back from the road on a patch of gravel. A schedule was posted on a metal pole — white paper behind plastic, the kind that yellowed in the sun. Sheldon studied it.

His eyes found the characters without effort. Line 47. Kamogata-Yama Line. A list of stops in neat columns, departure times running down the side. The stop he was at — 原田, Harada — was highlighted with a small red dot. The schedule showed the next bus at 4:15.

He checked his watch.

He wasn't wearing a watch.

The realization stopped him cold for a moment. He'd worn a watch since graduate school — a cheap Casio digital that had survived two decades of lab work. His wrist was bare now. Smooth skin where the tan line should have been.

He looked at the sun instead. Descending toward the western hills, maybe three hours from setting. If the next bus was at 4:15, and he'd been walking for roughly thirty minutes before Yamamoto picked him up, and the drive had been perhaps ten minutes... 

Close to four o'clock. Maybe a bit before.

He had time.

Sheldon sat on the bench. The wood was warm from the afternoon sun, weathered smooth by years of use. He could smell dust and greenery and, faintly, the exhaust residue of buses that had come and gone.

The road was quiet. A car passed — small, white, moving with the unhurried pace of rural traffic — and then nothing. Birds called from the fields. The same three-note song he'd heard in the field, *ho-hokekyo*, more distant now but still audible. 

He pulled out his wallet again.

The letter was still there, folded. He hadn't read it yet. Some part of him had been putting it off, as if the wallet's contents were a puzzle he needed to solve in order — ID first, then family registry, then photograph, then finally the words someone had written to him. Or written to whoever he was supposed to be.

He unfolded it.


The paper was thin, slightly yellowed. Handwritten in neat, careful characters — a woman's hand, he thought, though he couldn't say why. The date at the top read 1985年8月. August 1985.

*Sheldon,*

*By the time you read this, I will be gone. The doctors say weeks, maybe days. I'm writing while I still can.*

*I have left you everything — the house, the land, the savings. It isn't much, but it's yours. You are the last of the Tsukinos now. I'm sorry to leave you with that burden.*

*Your father's grave is in the village cemetery, next to your grandmother's. I couldn't bring myself to be buried there. I've asked to have my ashes scattered at sea, off the coast where your father and I walked when we were young. Forgive me for not being with him. Forgive me for leaving you alone.*

*Go home, Sheldon. Go back to Japan. The house is waiting for you. The land is waiting. Your uncle Kiyoshi will help you — he's a good man, even if we weren't close.*

*I love you. I have always loved you. You were the best thing that ever happened to me.*

*Your mother,*
*Sachiko*


Sheldon read the letter twice.

Then he folded it carefully and put it back in his wallet, and he sat very still on the bench while the world continued around him, heedless.

A mother who had died in 1985. A father who had died in 1978. An uncle named Kiyoshi. A house waiting for him in a village near a shrine called Masaki.

None of it was real. He knew that. He had been born in 1978, not 1959. His mother's name had been Dorothy, not Sachiko. His father had been a machinist in Marietta, not a farmer in Okayama.

But someone had built this life for him. Someone had created documents, planted memories, written letters in a dead woman's hand. Someone had given him a past he'd never lived, complete with grief he'd never earned.

*Why?*

The question was becoming familiar. He filed it with the others.

A sound intruded — engine noise, growing louder. He looked up.

A bus was approaching from the east. Small, white with blue trim, the kanji for "Shimoden" painted on the side. It slowed as it neared the stop, air brakes hissing, and came to rest precisely at the edge of the gravel.

The door folded open.


The driver was a man in his fifties, uniformed in the practical navy blue of transit workers. He glanced at Sheldon with professional neutrality — a quick assessment, nothing more.

"Jinja-mae?" Sheldon asked, confirming the destination. The words came out smooth, unaccented. He'd meant to ask more — how far, how long, whether this was the right bus — but the simple question was all that emerged.

The driver nodded. "Last stop."

Sheldon climbed aboard. The fare box was mounted beside the driver's seat, a mechanical device with a coin slot and a small digital display showing ¥230. He fed in coins — two hundreds, a fifty — and heard them clatter into the collection chamber.

The driver handed him a small paper stub. A receipt, or a ticket, or simply proof that he'd paid. Sheldon took it and moved down the aisle.

The bus was nearly empty. Two elderly women sat in the front seats, heads bent together in quiet conversation. A teenager in a school uniform sprawled in the back row, head against the window, eyes closed. No one looked at Sheldon as he chose a seat in the middle, on the right side, where he could watch the road ahead.

The door closed. The bus pulled away.


The landscape unfolded through the window — rice paddies giving way to forest, forest opening onto more paddies, the road winding north along the contour of the hills. Sheldon watched it pass and tried to think.

He was in Japan. In Okayama Prefecture, based on the documents. The year was 1989 — or close to it — if the registration date on his ID meant anything. April, based on the cherry blossoms. A Monday, maybe, given how empty the roads were.

He had money, documents, a destination. He had a house waiting for him, apparently, and an uncle who might recognize him. He had a history that wasn't his and a body that felt like a stranger's.

And he had died.

That part kept circling back. The containment breach. The light that wasn't light. The moment of ending, absolute and total. He remembered it clearly — more clearly than he wanted to. The memory wasn't fading or blurring the way dreams did. It sat in his mind like a stone, solid and undeniable.

He had died. And now he was on a bus in rural Japan, watching power lines tick past, holding a ticket stub he'd paid for with coins from a wallet he'd never owned.

The bus stopped. One of the elderly women stood, gathered a shopping bag, and shuffled toward the door. The driver called out the stop name — "Ōike" — and waited while she descended.

Four more stops, Sheldon thought. Eighteen minutes, maybe. Or less, with no one else getting off.

He looked at his hands. Still wrong. Still too young. The knuckles flexed smoothly when he made a fist, no ache, no stiffness. His grandmother had had arthritis by sixty. His father had complained of joint pain before he died. Sheldon had felt the first twinges in his own hands at forty-three, the inheritance coming due.

These hands had no inheritance. No history. No scars.

*Whose hands are these?*

The bus rumbled on.


The light was changing. Still bright, but softer now, the angle lowering as afternoon tilted toward evening. Shadows stretched longer across the paddies. The hills to the west were backlit, their edges glowing.

"Nakayama," the driver announced. No one moved. The bus paused, waited, continued.

The road climbed. Not steeply, but noticeably — the engine working harder, the view out the window tilting upward toward the tree line. They were leaving the valley floor, ascending toward the mountains.

Sheldon's throat was dry. He realized he hadn't had water since... since waking up. However long ago that was. An hour? More? His body was still functioning well — no headache, no dizziness — but the thirst was real, building.

*First you survive,* Grandmother's voice said. *Then you figure out the rest.*

Water, food, shelter. In that order. The shrine would have water, probably. Or he'd find the house. Either way, he'd manage.

"Sugitani."

The student in the back stirred, lifted his head, looked around with the dazed expression of someone surfacing from sleep. He didn't get up.

Two more stops.

The forest was thicker now, pressing close to the road. Cedar and cypress, dark green walls broken by the occasional splash of pink — wild cherry trees, blooming in the understory. The air through the bus's vents smelled different up here. Cooler. Cleaner. Mountain air.

"Miya-no-shita."

The second elderly woman rose, slower than the first. She nodded to the driver as she passed, murmured something polite. The door opened, closed. The bus pulled away.

One more stop.

Sheldon realized his heart was beating faster. Not fear, exactly. Anticipation. Or something like it. He was about to arrive somewhere — a place that his documents said was home, that a dead woman's letter said was waiting for him. He didn't know what he'd find there. Didn't know if the house existed, if the uncle was real, if any of the carefully constructed past would hold up to scrutiny.

But he was about to find out.

The bus rounded a curve. The forest opened. And there, ahead, Sheldon saw it:

A torii gate, vermillion red against the green, standing at the edge of the road. Beyond it, a gravel path leading into the trees. And beyond that, visible through the branches, the unmistakable shape of stone steps rising up the hillside.

"Jinja-mae," the driver announced. "Last stop."

Sheldon stood.


The air outside was noticeably cooler than it had been at the lower stop. Mountain air, thin and clean, carrying the scent of cedar and something else — incense, maybe, drifting down from above.

The bus pulled away behind him, its engine fading into the distance. Sheldon stood at the edge of the gravel and looked at the torii gate.

It was old. The paint was faded in places, weathered to a soft pink-red, but the structure itself was solid — massive wooden pillars sunk into stone bases, a curved crossbeam overhead. Characters were carved into a wooden plaque hanging from the beam:

柾木神社

*Masaki Jinja. Masaki Shrine.*

The farmer had been right. This was where the Tsukinos lived — near the shrine, he'd said. Sheldon still didn't know exactly where the house was, but this was the right area. This was where he was supposed to be.

He looked past the gate.

The stone steps began perhaps fifty meters ahead, rising into the forest. From here, he could only see the first dozen or so before they curved out of sight. But he could tell there were many more. The path climbed steeply, disappearing into green shadows.

Sheldon checked the sun. Still an hour or two of good light. Enough time to climb, to see what was at the top.

He walked toward the gate.

Sheldon paused at the torii gate.

The vermillion paint was faded but still vivid against the green of the forest. Up close, he could see the weathering — cracks in the wood, places where the color had worn to gray, moss climbing the stone bases. Old. Decades old, at least. Maybe centuries.

He knew the etiquette. The years in Kyoto had taught him that much. You bowed before passing through. You walked to the side, not the center — the center was for the kami. You approached with respect, regardless of what you believed.

Sheldon bowed. A small bow, the kind you gave to a stranger's house. Then he stepped through, keeping to the left, and walked toward the steps.


The path was gravel, well-maintained, crunching softly under his shoes. It led through a gap in the trees to where the stone steps began — a stairway climbing straight up the hillside, disappearing into the green.

He stopped at the base and looked up.

The steps were old. Worn smooth in the center where generations of feet had climbed. Some were cracked, others slightly tilted, but the overall structure was solid. Stone risers, maybe thirty centimeters each. He couldn't see the top from here — the stairway curved, or the forest blocked the view, or it simply went on too long.

*How many?*

He started climbing.


The first fifty steps were easy. His legs moved without complaint, his breathing stayed even. The late afternoon light filtered through the trees, golden and warm, casting long shadows across the stones.

Sheldon counted as he climbed. It was something to do with his mind while his body worked. Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

At a hundred steps, he paused. Not because he needed to — his breathing was still steady, his legs still strong — but because he expected to need to. A hundred steps was significant. A hundred steps should have left him winded, should have set his knees complaining, should have reminded him that he was forty-seven years old and spent most of his time sitting in front of computers.

None of that happened.

He stood on the hundredth step and felt... fine. Good, even. His heart rate was elevated but not racing. His muscles were warm but not burning. His back — his treacherous back, the one that had forced him to buy a standing desk and see a chiropractor twice a month — was silent.

*Wrong,* some part of him whispered. *This is wrong.*

He kept climbing.


At two hundred steps, the trees began to thin. More light reached the stairway, and Sheldon could see further ahead — the steps continuing upward, curving slightly to the right, a flash of color at the top that might have been a building.

He was breathing harder now. Not gasping, not struggling, but definitely working. His thighs felt the effort. Sweat was beginning to prickle at his hairline.

*Good,* he thought. *Normal. This is what climbing two hundred steps should feel like.*

Except it wasn't. Not really. He remembered climbing the steps at Kiyomizu-dera during his Kyoto years, remembered how his lungs had burned and his calves had screamed by the halfway point. He'd been thirty then — younger than this body appeared to be — and in reasonable shape. It had still nearly killed him.

This was... manageable. Challenging, but manageable. As if his body had been tuned for efficiency, optimized for exactly this kind of sustained effort.

He filed the observation with the others and kept climbing.


Two hundred fifty. Two hundred seventy. Two hundred ninety.

The shrine was visible now. He could see the edge of a roof above the tree line, the distinctive curve of Japanese temple architecture. Another torii, smaller than the first, marked the top of the stairs. Stone lanterns flanked the final approach.

Three hundred.

Three hundred ten.

Three hundred fifteen.

Sheldon emerged from the stairway onto level ground, and the Masaki Shrine spread out before him.


It was beautiful.

The main building sat at the center of a cleared space, its wooden walls weathered to a soft gray, its roof tiles dark with age. Smaller structures flanked it — a worship hall, a bell tower, what might have been a storehouse. Stone paths connected them, lined with carefully raked gravel. Moss grew on the older stones, green and soft in the fading light.

And behind it all, dominating the grounds, stood a tree.

Sheldon had seen large trees before. The redwoods in California. The chestnuts in Georgia. But this was different — not taller, necessarily, but *older*. The trunk was massive, easily ten meters in diameter, its bark deeply furrowed. Branches spread outward like arms, casting shade over half the shrine grounds. The leaves were thick and dark, rustling softly in the evening breeze.

*Old,* he thought. *Very old. Hundreds of years, maybe more.*

It was just a tree. A big tree, ancient and impressive, but just a tree. Sheldon didn't know why he kept looking at it, why his eyes kept drifting back to its trunk, its branches, the way the light seemed to gather in its crown.

He pulled his gaze away. Looked around the grounds instead.

The shrine appeared empty. No visitors, no priests, no movement except the wind in the leaves. The shadows were lengthening quickly now — sunset was perhaps an hour away, and the mountains to the west were already blocking the direct sun.

Sheldon stood at the edge of the grounds and wondered what to do next.

He could explore. Look for the priest, ask about the Tsukino family, find out where the house was. That was the logical approach — gather information, establish his cover story, proceed with the plan.

Except he didn't have a plan. He had documents and money and a body that didn't belong to him, and he had a letter from a dead woman telling him to come home. He had a destination but no idea what to do once he arrived.

His throat was very dry. His stomach had moved past hunger into a hollow ache. He'd been awake for — how long? Two hours? Three? It felt like a lifetime.

*First you survive,* Grandmother's voice reminded him. *Then you figure out the rest.*

Water. He needed water.

Sheldon looked around the grounds again, searching for a well, a fountain, anything. Shrines usually had a temizu-ya, a water basin for purification. If he could find that—

"Excuse me."

The voice came from behind him. Sheldon turned.

An old man stood at the edge of the worship hall, watching him. He wore the white robe and dark hakama of a Shinto priest, and his face was lined with the kind of deep wrinkles that spoke of decades in the sun. His hair was gray, pulled back. His posture was straight despite his apparent age — eighty, maybe older.

But his eyes.

His eyes were sharp. Alert. They took in Sheldon with a single glance, assessing, and something in them flickered — recognition? Curiosity? Sheldon couldn't tell.

"You look tired," the priest said. His voice was calm, unhurried. "Would you like some water?"

Sheldon's throat tightened. Whether from thirst or something else, he couldn't say.

"Yes," he managed. "Please."

The old man nodded and turned toward one of the smaller buildings. "Come, then. I'll make tea."

And because he had no better plan, and because his body was demanding water with increasing urgency, and because there was something in the old priest's calm that felt almost like safety, Sheldon followed.


**SCENE 3 — END**

**Word Count:** ~1,650 words

**Time Elapsed (Story):** ~15 minutes (4:35 PM to ~4:50 PM)

**Sheldon's Current State:**
- Physical: Mild exertion from climb (handled well), significant thirst, moderate hunger
- Emotional: Disoriented, grateful for offer of water, uncertain about next steps
- Knowledge: Has seen shrine grounds. Has seen Funaho (registered only as "big old tree"). Has met Katsuhito (doesn't know his name yet).

**Step Count:** 320 (verified against Bible — based on real Tarojinja)

**Open Threads:**
- Katsuhito has noticed something about Sheldon (the "flicker" in his eyes)
- Funaho was described but Sheldon didn't recognize significance
- Physical restoration continues to manifest (climb handled too well)

**Foreshadowing Planted:**
- Sheldon's eyes "kept drifting back" to Funaho — unconscious pull he can't explain
- Katsuhito's sharp assessment — he sees something others won't

**Next Scene:** Tea with Katsuhito, introduction, meeting Tenchi


**POST-SCENE AUDIT:**

Forbidden words check: PENDING

**PROACTIVE LAW CHECK:**
During writing, I noticed the temptation to describe Funaho as "emanating something" or "feeling different." Resisted this — Sheldon has no supernatural senses in Phase I. However, I did allow his eyes to "keep drifting back" — this is acceptable as it could be explained by the tree's sheer size/age, not supernatural perception.

**Potential Law Identified:** May need a law about "unconscious attraction vs. conscious perception" — Sheldon can be drawn to things without knowing why, but cannot consciously perceive supernatural elements. Flagging for consideration.

#### Scene 1.D: Tea With The Priest

- Scene 3 ended with Katsuhito offering water and saying "Come, then. I'll make tea."
- Scene 4 picks up immediately following him

BIBLE DETAILS FOR THIS SCENE:
- Katsuhito's appearance: Late 60s-70s (illusion), gray ponytail, round glasses, gray working clothes
- Katsuhito's assessment: Notes Sheldon's "wrong" energy signature, Lambda resonance
- Tenchi: 4 years old, playing with wooden blocks, curious about stranger
- Tenchi's appearance: ~100cm, bowl-cut black hair, yellow t-shirt, navy shorts, scrape on left knee

POTENTIAL ERROR PATTERNS:
- ⚠️ Making Katsuhito too mystical/knowing in dialogue (he's subtle, not obvious)
- ⚠️ Making Tenchi too articulate (he's 4 — simple sentences, many questions)
- ⚠️ Sheldon perceiving Katsuhito's assessment (Law 22 violation)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


The priest's residence was set back from the main shrine building, connected by a covered walkway. Traditional construction — dark wood, sliding doors, a narrow engawa running along the front. A pair of small white sneakers sat neatly beside the entrance, child-sized, with velcro straps.

The old man slid open the door and gestured inside. "Please."

Sheldon removed his shoes — muscle memory from Kyoto, the automatic action of entering a Japanese home — and stepped up onto the wooden floor. The interior was dim and cool, lit by the afternoon light filtering through paper screens. He caught the scent of tatami and something else, older, the accumulated years of a building that had stood for generations.

"This way." The priest led him through a short hallway into a room facing the courtyard. A low table sat at the center, surrounded by cushions. Through the open shoji, Sheldon could see the shrine grounds — the main building, the raked gravel, and beyond it all, the massive tree.

His eyes found it again without meaning to. Just a tree. He looked away.

"Please, sit." The priest indicated a cushion. "I'll prepare tea."

"Thank you." Sheldon's voice came out rough, his throat tight. He lowered himself onto the cushion, folding his legs beneath him in an approximation of seiza. His knees protested — 

No. They didn't.

He waited for the ache, the stiffness that came with sitting on hard floors, the familiar complaint of joints that had been complaining since his late thirties. It didn't come. His body folded into position with an ease that felt borrowed, as if he'd been practicing this posture his whole life.

*Wrong. Still wrong. Add it to the list.*


The priest moved around a small kitchen area visible through a doorway — the sound of water, the click of a gas stove, the quiet domesticity of tea preparation. Sheldon sat and tried to organize his thoughts.

He was in a shrine. He had climbed 320 steps — he'd counted — to reach it. An elderly priest had invited him in for tea. This was Japan, probably 1989, probably April. He had documents that said he was someone named Tsukino Sheldon, and a letter from a dead mother, and an uncle named Kiyoshi.

None of it made sense. All of it was happening anyway.

The priest returned carrying a wooden tray. On it sat a ceramic teapot, two cups, and a small plate of what looked like rice crackers. He set it on the table and lowered himself onto the opposite cushion with the practiced ease of someone who had been sitting on floors for decades.

"You climbed all 320 steps," the priest observed, pouring tea. Steam rose from the cups. "Most visitors take the road around the back."

"There's a road?"

The priest's lips twitched — not quite a smile, but something close. "There is. But you found the stairs." He slid a cup across the table. "Drink. You look like you need it."

Sheldon took the cup. The ceramic was warm against his palms, the heat seeping into his hands. He lifted it and drank.

The tea was hot and bitter and perfect. It hit his throat like water in a desert, spreading warmth through his chest. He hadn't realized how desperately thirsty he'd been until the relief came. He drained the cup in three long swallows and then sat there, embarrassed, holding the empty vessel.

The priest poured him another without comment.

"Thank you," Sheldon said. "I — thank you."

"You're welcome." The priest picked up his own cup, cradling it in both hands. "I am Masaki Katsuhito. I tend this shrine." A pause. "You are?"

"Tsukino." The name still felt strange on his tongue, a costume he hadn't learned to wear. "Tsukino Sheldon."

"Tsukino." Katsuhito's eyebrows rose slightly. "The family near here?"

"I don't know. Maybe. I'm trying to find them." Sheldon reached for the second cup, forced himself to drink more slowly. The tea was green, grassy, with a slight astringency that cut through the dust in his mouth. "My documents say I'm from this area. There's supposed to be a house. An uncle."

"Kiyoshi?"

Sheldon looked up sharply. "You know him?"

"I know of him. He moved to Osaka some years ago." Katsuhito sipped his tea, watching Sheldon over the rim. His eyes were calm, assessing, but not unkind. "The Tsukino house is about ten minutes' walk from here, down the mountain. It's been empty since Sachiko-san passed."

*Sachiko.* The name from the letter. The woman who had signed herself *Your mother*.

"You knew her?"

"Not well. She kept to herself in her last years. Illness." Katsuhito set down his cup. "You're her son?"

The question should have been simple. It wasn't.

"I..." Sheldon hesitated. *I don't know* was the honest answer, but it was also insane. He had documents. He had a koseki showing his birth, his parents' marriage, his grandmother's death. He had a letter in a dead woman's handwriting.

"Yes," he said finally. "I'm her son."

Katsuhito nodded slowly, as if the answer had told him something. What, Sheldon couldn't guess.


A sound from outside — footsteps on wood, quick and light. The shoji slid open and a small figure appeared in the doorway.

"Grandfather, who—"

The child stopped. Stared.

Sheldon stared back.

The boy was perhaps four years old, small and compact, with black hair cut in a simple bowl shape that stuck up slightly in the back. He wore a yellow t-shirt with some cartoon character Sheldon didn't recognize and navy blue shorts. His feet were bare, and there was a scrape on his left knee, the kind children collected by the dozen.

His eyes were wide. Dark brown, round with childhood, fixed on Sheldon's face with undisguised curiosity.

"Grandfather," the boy said, not looking away from Sheldon, "his face is different."

"Tenchi." Katsuhito's voice was gentle but firm. "That's not polite."

"But it is." The boy — Tenchi — took a step into the room, head tilted. "Why is it different?"

Sheldon felt something loosen in his chest. Children were honest. Children didn't dissemble or play social games they didn't understand. This boy was looking at him and seeing something unusual, and he was saying so, and there was nothing mean in it. Just curiosity.

"I'm from America," Sheldon said. "People there look different."

"America." Tenchi tested the word. "That's far away."

"Very far."

"Why did you come here?"

It was a good question. Sheldon didn't have an answer — not one that made sense, not one he could explain to a four-year-old, not one he could explain to himself.

"I'm looking for my family's house," he said. "Your grandfather is helping me."

Tenchi considered this. Then, apparently satisfied, he padded across the tatami and sat down next to Katsuhito, folding his legs with the unselfconscious ease of childhood. He reached for a rice cracker and began eating it, still watching Sheldon.

"Tenchi, this is Tsukino Sheldon-san," Katsuhito said. "He'll be staying in the area."

"Sheldon-san," Tenchi repeated carefully. "That's a hard name."

"You can call me Sheldon. Just Sheldon."

"Sheldon." The boy nodded, as if filing this away. "I'm Tenchi. I'm four." He held up four fingers to demonstrate. "I'll be five soon."

"Tenchi," Katsuhito said mildly, "let Sheldon-san finish his tea."

"He can talk and drink," Tenchi said reasonably. "I can do both at the same time. Watch." He took another bite of cracker and said, through a full mouth, "See?"

"Tenchi."

The boy subsided, but his eyes stayed on Sheldon, bright with questions held temporarily in reserve.


Sheldon drank his tea and ate two rice crackers that Katsuhito pressed on him, and slowly, piece by piece, the world began to feel slightly more real. His stomach stopped aching. His throat stopped burning. The late afternoon light slanted golden through the shoji, warming the tatami, and for a few minutes he allowed himself to simply exist in this room with this old priest and this curious child, suspended between the impossible past and the unknown future.

Katsuhito asked questions — where he'd studied, how long he'd been in Japan, what work he'd done. Sheldon answered as truthfully as he could, which meant half-truths and evasions, fragments of a life that had been Sheldon Carter's rather than Sheldon Tsukino's. Physics. Kyoto. Research.

If Katsuhito noticed the gaps, he didn't press.

"The house has been empty for four years," the priest said eventually. "Kiyoshi hired someone to check on it when he left, but I don't know what state it's in now. The village might have information."

"I'll find it tomorrow." The sun was getting lower. Sheldon could feel exhaustion pulling at him, the accumulated weight of a day that had started with dying. "Is there an inn nearby? Somewhere I could stay tonight?"

Katsuhito was quiet for a moment. His eyes moved to Tenchi, who had given up on staying still and was now examining Sheldon's shoes with great interest, then back to Sheldon.

"There's a room here," he said. "For guests. It's simple, but you're welcome to it."

Sheldon opened his mouth to refuse — politeness, automatic, the instinct to not impose. But he was tired. So tired. And there was something about this place, this shrine, this quiet room with its view of the ancient tree, that made him want to stay.

*Careful,* some part of him whispered. *You don't know these people. You don't know anything.*

But he was tired. And he had nowhere else to go.

"Thank you," Sheldon said. "I'd be grateful."

Katsuhito nodded, and something in his expression shifted — satisfaction, perhaps, or something more complicated.

"Then it's settled." He rose smoothly, joints apparently unbothered by the hard floor. "I'll show you the room. Tenchi, help me prepare dinner."

"Can Sheldon-san eat with us?"

"If he'd like."

"Do you like rice?" Tenchi asked Sheldon directly. "Grandfather makes good rice. And pickles. I don't like the pickles but he says I have to eat them anyway."

"I like rice," Sheldon said.

"Good." Tenchi nodded seriously. "That's good."

And Sheldon, despite everything — despite the impossibility of his situation, despite the terror lurking at the edges of his mind, despite not knowing who he was or how he'd gotten here or what any of it meant — found himself almost smiling.

## Part 1: Dinner

The kitchen was small and practical — a gas stove, a rice cooker with a dented lid, a refrigerator that hummed in the corner. Katsuhito moved through it with the economy of long habit, setting water to boil, pulling vegetables from a basket, sliding fish from paper wrapping onto a cutting board.

"Can I help?" Sheldon asked.

Katsuhito glanced at him. "You're a guest."

"I'd like to help."

A pause. Then: "The daikon needs washing. Sink is there."

Sheldon washed the daikon. It was a simple task — cold water, scrubbing away the dirt, the pale root emerging clean beneath his hands. His grandmother had grown daikon in her garden in Georgia, a small rebellion of Japanese vegetables among the collards and tomatoes. He hadn't thought about that in years.

Tenchi appeared at his elbow, standing on tiptoes to see what he was doing. "That's a big one."

"It is."

"Grandfather makes it into soup. Or pickles." The boy made a face. "I don't like pickles."

"You said that."

"I'm saying it again so you remember."

Sheldon found himself almost smiling. Again. That kept happening around this child — the corners of his mouth wanting to lift despite everything, despite the impossibility of his situation, despite the terror that lurked at the edges of his mind. Tenchi was four years old and earnest and had no idea that the stranger in his kitchen had died that morning and didn't understand why he was alive.

*Keep it together. You can fall apart later.*


Dinner was rice, miso soup, grilled mackerel, and pickled vegetables. They sat at the low table in the main room, the shoji open to the evening air. The sun had dropped behind the mountains, leaving the sky streaked with orange and purple. Somewhere outside, a bird was calling — not the uguisu, something else, a longer melody that rose and fell in the gathering dusk.

Katsuhito said a brief blessing. Tenchi echoed it, hands pressed together, eyes squeezed shut with exaggerated concentration. Then they ate.

The fish was good. Simple, salted, charred at the edges. The rice was perfect — each grain distinct, slightly sticky, the way Sheldon's grandmother had taught him to make it. The miso was rich with dashi, warming his stomach, spreading comfort through his tired body.

He ate more than he meant to. Three bowls of rice. Two servings of fish. Everything except the pickles, which Tenchi watched him refuse with visible satisfaction.

"See?" the boy said to Katsuhito. "Sheldon doesn't like them either."

"Sheldon-*san*," Katsuhito corrected mildly. "And guests are polite about food."

"I'm not a guest."

"Then you can eat your pickles."

Tenchi scowled but ate his pickles, one reluctant piece at a time, watching Sheldon as if expecting solidarity. Sheldon kept his expression neutral and took another bite of fish.


After dinner, Katsuhito cleared the dishes while Tenchi showed Sheldon his wooden blocks. They were old, hand-carved, the edges worn smooth from years of small hands. Tenchi had built a structure that was either a castle or a shrine — he couldn't decide which — and explained its features in exhaustive detail.

"This is where the king lives. Or the priest. And this is the tower for watching bad guys. And this is where they keep the food so the king doesn't get hungry."

"That's important," Sheldon agreed. "Kings need food."

"Everyone needs food." Tenchi stacked another block on top, wobbling the whole structure. "Do you have a castle?"

"No."

"A house?"

The question caught Sheldon off guard. Did he? His documents said there was a house — the Tsukino house, ten minutes down the mountain, empty for four years. But that wasn't *his* house. His house had been a two-bedroom apartment in Pasadena, cluttered with physics journals and take-out containers, the place where he'd lived alone since the divorce.

"I might," he said finally. "I'm not sure yet."

"How can you not be sure if you have a house?"

"It's complicated."

Tenchi considered this. "Grown-up things are always complicated," he said, with the weary wisdom of a four-year-old. "That's what grandfather says."

"Your grandfather is right."


At seven-thirty, Katsuhito announced that it was time for Tenchi's bath. The boy protested — he wanted to show Sheldon more blocks, he wasn't tired, he had important things to say — but Katsuhito was immovable, guiding him toward the bath with gentle firmness.

"Say goodnight to Sheldon-san."

Tenchi turned at the doorway. "Will you be here tomorrow?"

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, who gave a small nod.

"Yes," Sheldon said. "I'll be here."

"Good." Tenchi smiled — a sudden, bright expression that transformed his whole face. "I'll show you the big tree tomorrow. It's really, really big. Grandfather says it's older than everything."

"I'd like that."

"Goodnight, Sheldon."

"Goodnight, Tenchi."

The boy disappeared into the hallway, and Sheldon was alone.


## Part 2: The Guest Room

The room Katsuhito showed him was small, spare, and clean. A futon had been laid out on the tatami, topped with a thick comforter. A low table sat against one wall, bearing a ceramic lamp that cast warm light across the ceiling. A window looked out onto the shrine grounds, the glass dark now, reflecting the lamp's glow.

"The bathroom is at the end of the hall," Katsuhito said. "There should be a clean towel. If you need anything..." He paused. "I'm an early riser. Breakfast is at six-thirty."

"Thank you." The words felt inadequate. "For everything. The tea, the dinner, the room. You didn't have to—"

"You looked like you needed it."

It wasn't a question, and it wasn't an invitation to explain. Just a statement of fact, delivered with the same calm that seemed to be Katsuhito's default mode. The old priest had watched Sheldon all evening — not obviously, not intrusively, but consistently, those sharp eyes taking in details Sheldon couldn't guess at.

"Sleep well," Katsuhito said. "Tomorrow will be a long day."

Then he was gone, the shoji sliding shut behind him, and Sheldon was alone.


## Part 3: Darkness

He didn't turn off the lamp.

He sat on the futon, back against the wall, legs stretched out before him, and stared at nothing. The room was quiet. The shrine was quiet. Somewhere in the distance, he could hear Katsuhito's voice, muffled — probably putting Tenchi to bed, reading a story, doing the ordinary things that ordinary grandparents did with ordinary children.

Sheldon was not ordinary. He never had been. But this — *this* — was something else entirely.

He had died.

He let the thought sit there, heavy and undeniable. He had been in the containment lab. The field had collapsed. The light had come. And he had ended — not gradually, not with time to prepare, but instantly, completely, between one heartbeat and the nothing that followed.

He remembered it. That was the worst part. He remembered dying, and he remembered what came after: the darkness, the absence, the void that wasn't sleep because sleep implied waking. He had been *gone*. Utterly, irrevocably gone.

And then he'd woken up in a field in Japan with cherry blossoms in his hair and a body that wasn't his.


The wallet sat on the table beside the lamp. Sheldon reached for it, opened it, spread the contents across the futon.

The ID card with his face and a stranger's history. The koseki showing a family tree he'd never climbed. The bankbooks proving access to money he'd never earned. The photograph — he hadn't looked at it closely before. He looked now.

Three people stood in front of a modest house, mountains visible behind them. A man in work clothes, unsmiling but not unkind. A woman in a floral dress, her hair pulled back, her expression gentle. Between them, a boy — maybe six or seven, thin and serious, looking at the camera with a directness that was almost challenging.

Was that him? Was that supposed to be him?

The boy in the photograph was Japanese. Both parents were Japanese. Sheldon was Black — had been Black his entire life, born in Atlanta to a Black father and a Japanese mother, growing up in the strange borderland between two communities that didn't always know what to make of him.

But this photograph showed a family that didn't include him. Couldn't include him. The boy's face was too different, his features too—

Wait.

Sheldon looked at the photograph again. Then he looked at the ID card. Then he held both up to the light.

The man on the ID card was Black. Light-skinned, mixed, but unmistakably Black. The bone structure, the nose, the hair texture — all of it screamed the same heritage Sheldon had carried his whole life.

But the boy in the photograph...

*What the hell?*


He stared at the two images for a long time, trying to make them fit. They didn't. They couldn't. A Japanese family couldn't produce a Black son. The genetics didn't work that way. Whatever had created his documents had made a mistake — an obvious, glaring mistake that anyone who looked would notice.

Unless they weren't meant to be looked at together. Unless the photograph was from *before*, and the ID was from *after*, and something had changed between them.

*Changed you,* a voice whispered. *Changed everything.*

Sheldon put the documents away. His hands were shaking.


He didn't sleep. Not really.

He lay on the futon with the lamp still on, watching shadows on the ceiling, his mind running in circles. The containment breach. The light. The field. The body. The documents. The photograph. The boy who wasn't him. The man who was.

None of it added up. None of it made sense. Someone had gone to extraordinary lengths to build him a life — a past, a family, a place in this world — and they'd done it imperfectly, leaving seams that showed if you looked hard enough.

*Why?*

The question had been following him all day. It was no closer to an answer now than it had been in the field.

Outside, the night was deep and quiet. No cars, no sirens, no hum of traffic. Just the wind in the trees and the distant sound of water — a spring, maybe, or a stream — and occasionally a bird calling out across the darkness.

His grandmother would have called this peaceful. She had grown up in a village not so different from this one, before the war, before America, before everything changed. She had told him stories about nights like this — the silence so complete you could hear your own heartbeat, the stars so bright they cast shadows.

*You would have understood,* he thought. *You always understood the strange things. The things that didn't fit.*

His grandmother had believed in spirits. In ancestors who watched over the living. In the idea that death wasn't an ending but a doorway.

Sheldon had never believed. He was a physicist. He dealt in equations and evidence, in things that could be measured and proven. Spirits and doorways and ancestors — those were stories, comforting fictions to soften the hard truth of entropy and dissolution.

But he had died. And he was here. And there was no equation that explained it.


At some point, exhaustion won.

Not sleep, exactly — his mind kept churning, processing, refusing to quiet — but something close to it. A drifting state where thoughts became tangled and the boundaries between memory and imagination blurred.

He dreamed of light. Not the harsh light of the containment breach, but something softer — silver, like moonlight, like starlight, like something that had no name. It wrapped around him, warm and patient, and a voice that wasn't a voice said:

*You're safe now.*

He woke to darkness, the lamp having finally burned out, and for a moment he didn't know where he was. Then it came back — the shrine, the guest room, the impossible day — and he lay there in the dark, heart pounding, until the gray light of dawn began to seep through the window.

Day two.

He had survived day one. He didn't know what day two would bring, but he had survived.

For now, that would have to be enough.

## Part 1: Waking

Gray light. Bird calls. The creak of old wood somewhere in the house.

Sheldon opened his eyes to an unfamiliar ceiling — dark beams, plastered white between them, shadows gathered in the corners. For a long moment he didn't move, his mind struggling to bridge the gap between sleep and waking, between the silver light of his dreams and the pale reality of dawn.

*Japan. Shrine. Guest room.*

It came back in pieces. The field. The bus. The 320 steps. Katsuhito and Tenchi. Dinner. The photograph.

The photograph.

He sat up. His body moved easily — no stiffness, no aching joints, none of the morning complaints that had been his constant companions for the last decade. That wrongness again, that persistent reminder that this body wasn't his, that he was wearing borrowed flesh like borrowed clothes.

The lamp had burned out sometime in the night. Sheldon's wallet sat on the low table where he'd left it, the documents still inside, the photograph with its impossible family tucked between his ID and his cash.

He didn't reach for it. Not yet. Some problems were too large for dawn.


The bathroom was at the end of the hall, as Katsuhito had said. Sheldon used the toilet, splashed water on his face, studied himself in the small mirror above the sink.

The face looking back was still wrong. Still young. Still his and not his. The eyes were the same — he recognized his own eyes, his grandmother's eyes, the shape and color unchanged despite everything else. But the skin was smoother, the jaw firmer, the gray that had crept into his temples gone as if it had never been.

*Thirty,* he thought. *I look thirty.*

He had been thirty once, a lifetime ago. He remembered it vaguely — the post-doc years at Berkeley, the failed marriage already crumbling, the work that had consumed everything else. He hadn't liked being thirty. Too young to be taken seriously, too old to be forgiven for his failures.

But this thirty was different. This was a body without history, without scars, without the accumulated damage of years. A fresh start in the most literal sense possible.

*Who did this to me? Why?*

The questions had no answers. He dried his face and went to find breakfast.


## Part 2: Breakfast

The kitchen was already occupied. Katsuhito stood at the stove, stirring something in a pot. The smell of miso filled the small space, rich and familiar, mixing with the sharper scent of grilling fish.

"Good morning," Katsuhito said without turning. "Did you sleep?"

"Some." It wasn't quite a lie.

"Tea is ready. Rice will be a few minutes."

Sheldon poured himself tea from the pot on the table. The ceramic was warm, the liquid bitter and bracing. He drank and felt the fog in his head begin to lift.

Footsteps in the hallway — quick, light, the unmistakable rhythm of a child. Tenchi appeared in the doorway, already dressed in what Sheldon recognized as a school uniform: white shirt, navy shorts, a yellow cap clutched in one hand.

"You're still here!" The boy's face lit up. "Grandfather said you might leave."

"Did he?"

"He said sometimes people leave in the night. But you didn't."

"I didn't."

Tenchi nodded seriously, as if this confirmed something important. Then he climbed onto a cushion at the table and began arranging his chopsticks with exaggerated care.

"I have school today," he announced. "Kindergarten. The bus comes at eight-thirty. I know all my letters. Do you want to hear them?"

"After breakfast," Katsuhito said, setting plates on the table. "Eat first."

Breakfast was rice, miso soup, a small grilled fish, and pickled vegetables. Tenchi ate quickly, stealing glances at Sheldon between bites, clearly bursting with questions he'd been told to hold. Katsuhito ate slowly, methodically, his attention seemingly on his food but his awareness — Sheldon could feel it — extending to everything in the room.

"After Tenchi catches his bus," Katsuhito said, "I thought we might walk to the Tsukino house. If you're ready."

Sheldon's chopsticks paused over his rice. The house. His supposed inheritance. The place where a family he'd never known had lived and died.

"Yes," he said. "I'd like that."


## Part 3: The Bus

At eight-twenty, Tenchi was vibrating.

"The bus is coming," he said for the fourth time, pressing his face against the window. "I can't see it yet but I know it's coming."

"Then you should go down to meet it," Katsuhito said.

"Can Sheldon watch?"

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, who nodded slightly.

"I'll watch from here," Sheldon said.

They walked out to the engawa — the wooden veranda that wrapped around the residence. From here, Sheldon could see the shrine grounds spreading out before him: the main building, the raked gravel, the massive tree that dominated everything. In the morning light, the tree looked different — more solid somehow, more present, its leaves catching the sun and holding it.

He made himself look away.

A path led down from the shrine grounds, disappearing into the trees — a shortcut, Sheldon guessed, steeper than the main stairs but faster for small legs that knew the way. Tenchi pulled on his yellow cap, adjusted his backpack, and turned to face them.

"I'll be back at two-forty-five," he said. "That's when the bus brings us home. Will you still be here?"

"I'll be here," Sheldon said.

"Promise?"

The word caught in Sheldon's throat. He had made very few promises in his life, and he'd broken most of them. But this was a four-year-old asking if the stranger who'd appeared in his life would still exist when he got home from school.

"Promise," Sheldon said.

Tenchi smiled — that sudden, transforming expression — and then he was gone, darting down the path with the heedless speed of childhood, his yellow cap bobbing until the trees swallowed him.


## Part 4: The Walk

"He likes you," Katsuhito observed.

They were standing at the edge of the shrine grounds, looking down the path Tenchi had taken. In the distance, Sheldon could hear the sound of an engine — the kindergarten bus, probably, making its rounds through the mountain roads.

"He doesn't know me."

"Children often see more clearly than adults." Katsuhito turned toward a small shed near the residence. "The house is about fifteen minutes' walk. Do you need a walking stick?"

Sheldon almost said no — his body felt fine, strong, capable of any walk — but something in Katsuhito's tone suggested this was a test. Or perhaps just practical wisdom from someone who knew the paths.

"If you have one to spare."

Katsuhito retrieved two walking sticks from the shed, both well-worn, both clearly handmade. He offered one to Sheldon and kept the other, and together they set off down a different path than the one Tenchi had taken — this one curving around the back of the shrine, descending through a forest of cedar and cypress.

The morning was cool but warming. Sunlight filtered through the canopy in shafts and patches, and birds called from the branches overhead. Sheldon recognized the uguisu — that three-note song, *ho-hokekyo*, that had followed him since the field. It felt almost like a companion now, a thread of continuity in a world that had lost all other anchors.

"You speak Japanese very well," Katsuhito said after a few minutes of walking. "Where did you study?"

"Kyoto. Twelve years ago." *In another life. In another body.* "I was there for graduate research."

"And then?"

"California. Work. Life." The words came out flat, inadequate. How could he explain the years that followed — the career, the divorce, the slow narrowing of his world until it contained nothing but equations and empty apartments?

"But you came back."

"Apparently."

Katsuhito glanced at him — a quick, assessing look that revealed nothing. "Family calls us home sometimes. Even when we don't expect it."

*Family.* The word felt strange. Sheldon had family — had *had* family. His grandmother, dead these fifteen years. His parents, gone even longer. A brother somewhere in Chicago who he hadn't spoken to since their mother's funeral. Those were real. Those had happened.

But Sachiko Tsukino, who had died in 1985, who had written him a letter full of love and grief, who had left him a house and land and a place in this village — she wasn't family. She couldn't be. He had never met her, never known her, never existed in the same world she'd inhabited.

And yet her letter was in his wallet, and her house was ahead of him, and her son — supposedly — was walking through a forest in Japan trying to understand why.


## Part 5: The House

The Tsukino house sat at the bottom of a small valley, surrounded by what had once been cultivated land. Now the fields were overgrown, knee-high with grass and weeds, the irrigation channels choked with debris. A path led from the forest to the house, barely visible under the vegetation.

The house itself was small — two rooms, maybe three, traditional construction with a tiled roof and wooden walls. The engawa sagged visibly on the left side, several boards missing or broken. Tiles had slipped from the roof, leaving gaps that would let in rain. The shoji screens were torn, the paper hanging in strips.

But it was still standing. Still whole, in its way. A house that had been waiting.

Katsuhito stopped at the edge of the property. "I'll wait here. Take your time."

Sheldon walked forward alone.

The garden had been allowed to run wild. What might have been vegetable plots were now tangles of volunteer growth — something that might be daikon, gone to seed; tomato plants sprawling unsupported; what looked like the remains of a cucumber trellis, collapsed and overgrown. Near the house, a small shed had partially caved in, its roof timbers visible through the gap.

He climbed the three steps to the engawa, testing each board before putting his weight on it. The wood creaked but held. The front door was locked — a simple wooden lock, the kind that could be opened with any flat implement — but he didn't try it. He walked around the engawa instead, peering through the gaps in the shoji, trying to see inside.

Tatami floors, covered in dust. A low table, still in place. A scroll on the wall, faded beyond reading. In one room, a futon had been left out — four years ago, perhaps, when Sachiko had last slept here. Or longer, if someone had come to close up the house after she died.

*Home,* something whispered. *This could be home.*

He didn't know if the voice was his own or something else. It didn't matter. The thought was true regardless of its source.


## Part 6: The Decision

He found Katsuhito where he'd left him, waiting at the forest's edge with the patience of someone who had all the time in the world.

"The house needs work," Sheldon said.

"Yes."

"The roof needs retiling. The engawa needs rebuilding. The screens need replacing." He was listing them out, organizing the chaos into manageable pieces, the way he'd always organized problems. "The garden is overgrown but the soil looks good. The structure itself seems sound."

"You know something about construction?"

"No." *Not in this life.* "But I could learn."

Katsuhito studied him for a long moment. Those sharp eyes, seeing things Sheldon couldn't guess at.

"It will cost money," the old priest said. "Labor, materials, tools."

"I have some money." The bankbooks in his wallet. Eight hundred thousand yen, give or take. Not a fortune, but not nothing either.

"It will take time."

"I have time."

"You'll need help. The village has carpenters, craftsmen. They'll want to know who you are."

Sheldon thought about that. Who was he? A dead physicist in a borrowed body? A son who had never been born? A stranger with documents that said he belonged here even though he knew he didn't?

"I'm Tsukino Sheldon," he said finally. "Sachiko's son. I've come home."

The words felt like a choice. Like something settling into place, a door closing behind him even as another opened ahead.

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "Then we should talk to Yamada-san. He does roofing. And Suzuki at the lumber yard — he'll give you fair prices if I vouch for you." A pause. "It won't be easy. Foreigners aren't common here. There will be questions."

"I know."

"And you're staying anyway."

It wasn't a question, but Sheldon answered it as if it were.

"Yes. I'm staying."

The walk back to the shrine was quieter than the walk down. The forest pressed close around them, green and alive, and the birds sang in the branches, and the morning sun climbed higher through the trees. Sheldon's mind was already working on lists — materials needed, skills to acquire, people to meet, a house to make habitable.

He had a place now. A purpose. It wasn't much — just a decaying house in a rural village, a mystery he couldn't solve, a life that wasn't his. But it was more than he'd had yesterday.

*First you survive,* Grandmother's voice said, warm and approving. *Then you build.*

He was going to build.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


## Part 1: Dishes

Back at the shrine, Sheldon looked for something to do.

The kitchen had dishes from breakfast — bowls, chopsticks, the pot that had held miso soup. Katsuhito was somewhere else, doing whatever it was priests did in the mid-morning, and Sheldon stood in the small kitchen feeling useless.

He hated feeling useless.

The sink was a deep ceramic basin with a hand pump mounted on one side. Sheldon tried it — stiff resistance, then nothing. He tried again, putting more weight into it. A dribble of water. Third time, a proper stream.

*Three pulls,* he noted. *Primes on the third pull.*

He washed the dishes. It wasn't complicated — rinse, scrub with the brush he found in a dish beside the sink, rinse again, set to dry on the wooden rack. The water was cold, drawn from a well somewhere below the kitchen. The soap was a rough bar that smelled of lye and something floral.

His grandmother had washed dishes this way. Not with a pump — she'd had running water by the time he knew her — but with the same economy of motion, the same quiet attention to the task. She'd taught him that dishes weren't just dishes. They were respect for the food that had been served, for the hands that had prepared it, for the home that held them all.

*You're never too important for honest work,* she'd said. *The moment you think you are, you've lost something you can't get back.*

He finished the dishes and dried his hands on a rough towel hanging by the stove. The kitchen was clean now, or cleaner than it had been. A small thing. But it was something.


## Part 2: The Courtyard

He found Katsuhito sweeping the courtyard.

The old priest moved with the same unhurried rhythm Sheldon had noticed at breakfast — steady, methodical, each stroke of the bamboo broom pushing gravel into neat lines. The pattern that emerged was intentional, Sheldon realized. Not just cleaning but arranging, creating order from randomness.

"I finished the dishes," Sheldon said.

Katsuhito didn't stop sweeping. "Thank you."

"Is there something else I can do?"

Now the priest paused, looking at Sheldon with those sharp, assessing eyes. "You don't have to work. You're a guest."

"I'd rather work."

A long moment. Something shifted in Katsuhito's expression — not approval exactly, but something adjacent to it. He gestured toward the shed where he'd gotten the walking sticks that morning.

"There's another broom. The courtyard is large."


The courtyard was large.

Sheldon swept. The broom was similar to Katsuhito's — bamboo handle, soft bristles, lighter than it looked. The motion came back to him without thought: long strokes, let the bristles do the work, keep the line even. His grandmother again. The church parking lot on Saturday mornings, preparing for Sunday services, the old women sweeping and gossiping while he trailed behind with his child-sized broom.

*Physical work is prayer,* she'd told him. *When your hands are busy, your soul can rest.*

He hadn't believed that then. He'd been a teenager, impatient with anything that couldn't be solved by thinking harder. But now, decades later — or was it decades? time had become strange — he understood what she meant. There was something meditative in the repetition, something settling. His mind, which had been racing since he woke up in the field, began to slow.

Sweep. Step. Sweep. Step.

The gravel made satisfying sounds under the bristles. The sun climbed higher, warming his back. His shoulders found a rhythm that didn't tire, his legs carried him across the courtyard without complaint. The body he was wearing — this young, restored, borrowed body — was built for this kind of work. It responded to exertion with efficiency rather than protest.

He swept for two hours. When he stopped, the courtyard was clean, the gravel raked into the same careful pattern Katsuhito had begun, and his shirt was damp with sweat but his muscles felt loose rather than sore.

Katsuhito was watching him from the engawa.

"You've done this before," the priest said.

"My grandmother. Church grounds." Sheldon leaned the broom against his shoulder. "Saturday mornings."

"She taught you well."

It wasn't a question, and Sheldon didn't treat it as one. He simply nodded and waited.

"Tea," Katsuhito said. "Then we'll see about the garden."


## Part 3: Tea

They sat on the engawa, legs hanging over the edge, cups of green tea warming their hands. The courtyard spread out before them, freshly swept, the gravel catching the early afternoon light. Beyond it, the main shrine building stood quiet and solid, and beyond that—

The tree.

Sheldon's eyes found it without meaning to. They kept doing that — drifting toward the massive trunk, the spreading branches, the dark leaves that seemed to hold the light rather than reflect it. It was just a tree. He knew it was just a tree. But his attention kept returning to it, the way a compass needle returns to north.

"The tree is old," Katsuhito said, following his gaze.

"How old?"

"Very." The priest sipped his tea. "It was here when my ancestors built the shrine. It will be here when my descendants tend it."

*Ancestors. Descendants.* The words carried weight Sheldon couldn't parse. He thought of Tenchi — the boy who called this man grandfather, who would someday inherit this shrine, this tree, this quiet life among the mountains. A line stretching backward and forward through time, anchored by this place.

Sheldon had no such line. His family had been scattered by history — war, migration, the slow attrition of generations that didn't reproduce. His brother had no children. His ex-wife had remarried someone else. His parents' line ended with him.

Or had ended with him. Before.

"You're thinking," Katsuhito observed.

"I think too much. It's a habit."

"Habits can be changed."

"Can they?"

The priest didn't answer. He finished his tea, set the cup aside, and rose with the fluid motion of someone half his apparent age.

"The garden needs weeding. Tomorrow, if you're staying, we can talk about what comes next."


## Part 4: The Garden

The garden behind the residence was smaller than the courtyard but more complex. Vegetable plots in raised beds, separated by narrow paths. A tool shed. A compost pile. The remnants of last year's crops — withered tomato stakes, tangled bean frames — mixed with the new growth of spring weeds.

Katsuhito handed him a pair of worn gloves and a hand trowel.

"Pull the weeds, not the vegetables. If you're not sure, ask."

Then he left. Back to the shrine, to whatever duties occupied a priest's afternoon, leaving Sheldon alone with the soil and the sun and the steady work of clearing.

It was harder than sweeping. The weeds had roots, some of them deep, and the ground was packed from winter. Sheldon knelt in the dirt and dug, pulled, shook loose soil from roots, added the weeds to a growing pile. His knees didn't complain about the kneeling. His back didn't seize when he bent and straightened. The body just... worked.

*Wrong,* the familiar voice whispered. *Still wrong.*

But useful. Whatever had been done to him, however impossible this body was, it was letting him do things his old body couldn't have managed. Two hours of sweeping followed by an afternoon of weeding — his forty-seven-year-old self would have been crippled by now. This version of him just kept going.

He found a rhythm. Pull, shake, pile. Pull, shake, pile. The sun tracked across the sky, shadows shifting. Birds called in the trees. Occasionally he heard sounds from the shrine — Katsuhito's footsteps, the distant ring of a bell, the creak of old wood — but mostly there was just the garden and the work and the slow, meditative emptiness of physical labor.

His grandmother would have approved.


## Part 5: Return

"You're still here!"

The voice came from behind him. Sheldon turned, hands dirty, knees grass-stained, and found Tenchi standing at the edge of the garden, yellow cap askew, backpack hanging half-off one shoulder, face split in a grin.

"I'm still here."

"You promised and you stayed!" The boy's delight was so complete, so unguarded, that Sheldon felt something shift in his chest. "Grandfather said maybe you'd be here and maybe you wouldn't and I said you promised and promises are important and you DID stay!"

"I did."

Tenchi dropped his backpack on the path and came closer, examining the garden with the serious attention of a four-year-old.

"You're pulling weeds."

"Yes."

"I can help. I know which ones are weeds. That one's a weed." He pointed at something green. "And that one. But that one's daikon. You can't pull that."

"Thank you. I wasn't sure."

Tenchi nodded gravely, then sat down on the path, apparently planning to supervise. His uniform was dusty — evidence of a day's worth of kindergarten activities — and there was something sticky on his cheek, but his eyes were bright and fixed on Sheldon with a focus that felt almost physical.

"My teacher asked where I'm from," Tenchi said. "I said here. She said everyone's from somewhere else before here. Is that true?"

"Sometimes." Sheldon pulled another weed, added it to the pile. "People move around. They come from one place and go to another."

"Where did you come from?"

*California. Atlanta. Berkeley. A containment lab in Pasadena. A life that doesn't exist anymore.*

"America," he said. "A long way away."

"Why did you leave?"

"I..." He paused, trowel in hand, unsure how to answer. Why had he left? He hadn't left. He'd died. He'd been brought here against his will — or without his consent, at least. Nothing about his presence in Japan was a choice he'd made.

Except staying. That was a choice. He'd made it this morning, standing in front of the house that wasn't his, looking at a life that had been built for him by someone or something he didn't understand.

"I came to find my family," he said finally. It was true enough. "My mother's family. They lived here, before."

"But they're gone now?"

"Yes. They're gone now."

Tenchi considered this, his small face serious. "Grandfather says people who go away are still with us. Just different. Like they're far away but also here." He touched his chest, over his heart. "In here."

Sheldon's throat tightened. "Your grandfather is wise."

"He's old." Tenchi said it matter-of-factly. "Old people know things. Do you know things? You're not as old as grandfather but you're older than me."

"I know some things."

"Like what?"

*Like the quantum properties of confined electromagnetic fields. Like the taste of failure at 3 AM in an empty lab. Like what it feels like to die.*

"I know how to pull weeds," Sheldon said. "Do you want to help?"

Tenchi's face lit up. "Yes!"

He scrambled over to kneel beside Sheldon, small hands reaching for the nearest green thing. Sheldon caught his wrist gently.

"That one's daikon. Remember?"

"Oh." Tenchi squinted at it. "They look the same."

"Look at the leaves. See how this one has smooth edges?" Sheldon pointed. "That's the daikon. Weeds usually have jagged edges, or fuzzy stems, or different colors."

"Smooth is good. Jagged is bad."

"For now, yes."

Tenchi nodded seriously and reached for a weed — a real one this time, with jagged leaves and a fuzzy stem. He pulled. It came up easily, roots and all.

"I did it!"

"You did. Put it on the pile."

They worked together in the afternoon sun — the man with no past and the boy with too much future, pulling weeds side by side, not talking much, not needing to. The shadows grew longer. The pile of weeds grew higher. And somewhere in the process, without either of them noticing, something began to take root.

#### Scene 2.C: Questions

The weed pile had grown impressive — knee-high, spilling across the path, evidence of an afternoon's labor. Tenchi had tired eventually, his four-year-old energy cycling from manic enthusiasm to sudden stillness, and now he sat on the edge of a raised bed, dirty hands in his lap, watching Sheldon finish the last row.

"Sheldon?"

"Mm?"

"Are you tired?"

Sheldon straightened, pressing a hand to his lower back out of habit. There was no pain — there hadn't been pain all day — but the gesture was automatic, a remnant of a body he no longer wore.

"A little," he said. "Good tired."

"What's good tired?"

"The kind you get from doing something useful." He pulled the last weed, shook the dirt from its roots, added it to the pile. "When you work hard and then you stop, and your body says *thank you for stopping* but also *that was worth doing*."

Tenchi considered this with the gravity of a philosopher. "I get tired from running. Is that good tired?"

"If you were running somewhere important."

"I was running to see if you were still here."

Sheldon's chest did something complicated. "Then yes. Good tired."


## Part 2: Washing Up

There was a spigot at the side of the residence, fed by the same well that supplied the kitchen. Katsuhito had left a bar of soap and two rough towels on a wooden bench beside it.

"Wash your hands and face," Sheldon told Tenchi. "Dinner soon."

"I know. Grandfather's making curry." The boy's face lit up. "Curry is my favorite. Do you like curry?"

"I do."

"Good. Grandfather makes it from scratch. He says the store kind is cheating."

Sheldon turned the spigot, let cold water run over his hands. The dirt of the afternoon sluiced away, brown rivulets disappearing into the drain. His hands emerged clean — still wrong, still too young, but clean.

Tenchi splashed beside him, more water on his shirt than on his hands, making sounds of exaggerated effort. Sheldon watched him and felt something unfamiliar settling in his chest. Not quite warmth. Not quite peace. Something quieter than either.

*This is real,* he thought. *Whatever else is happening, this moment is real.*


## Part 3: Curry

The kitchen smelled extraordinary.

Katsuhito stood at the stove, stirring a large pot with unhurried attention. The curry sauce was dark and rich, studded with chunks of potato and carrot and what looked like pork. A rice cooker steamed on the counter. The whole room was warm and fragrant and *alive* in a way that made Sheldon's stomach clench with sudden, desperate hunger.

"Smells good," he said.

Katsuhito glanced over his shoulder. "Sit. It's almost ready."

Sheldon sat. Tenchi climbed onto the cushion beside him, still damp from washing, practically vibrating with anticipation.

"Grandfather's curry is the best," the boy announced. "Better than anyone's. Even better than the curry at school."

"High praise."

"School curry is very good. Grandfather's is better."

Katsuhito served without ceremony — large bowls of rice, the curry ladled over top, a small dish of pickled vegetables on the side. The portions were generous, the presentation simple, the smell overwhelming.

Sheldon took his first bite.

The curry was... 

He stopped. Chewed. Swallowed.

It was *good*. Remarkably good. The sauce was complex — sweet and savory and slightly spicy, with a depth that suggested hours of simmering. The pork was tender, the vegetables perfectly cooked, the rice the ideal texture to absorb the sauce without becoming mush.

But more than that, it was *familiar*. Not in the sense that he'd tasted this specific curry before, but in a deeper way, a way that bypassed thought and went straight to something older. His grandmother had made curry sometimes — her version, adapted from her mother's recipe, adjusted for American ingredients. It hadn't tasted like this. But it had *felt* like this. Like someone had taken time and care to make something nourishing, something meant to fill more than just a stomach.

"You stopped," Tenchi observed.

Sheldon realized he was sitting with his spoon halfway to his mouth, staring at nothing.

"It's very good," he said. "I was... appreciating it."

Katsuhito's eyes flickered with something that might have been amusement. "Eat. There's more."

Sheldon ate. Two bowls. Would have eaten a third if Tenchi hadn't gotten there first.


## Part 4: Questions

After dinner, Katsuhito cleared the dishes. Tenchi remained at the table, watching Sheldon with the particular intensity of a child who has been waiting for something.

"Sheldon?"

"Yes?"

"Can I ask you things now?"

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, who was doing something at the sink and very deliberately not turning around.

"What kind of things?"

"Questions. I've been saving them."

"How many have you saved?"

Tenchi held up both hands, fingers spread. Then frowned, folded down two fingers, reconsidered, put one back up. "This many. Maybe more."

Nine questions. Maybe more.

"All right," Sheldon said. "Ask."


"Why is your face different?"

"I told you. I'm from America. People there—"

"No, I mean *different* different. Your eyes are like mine but your skin isn't and your hair is curly and grandfather's hair isn't curly and neither is mine." Tenchi reached up to touch his own straight black hair, as if confirming. "Did you get it from your mother? Grandfather says I got my hair from my mother."

Sheldon's throat tightened. "My mother was Japanese. Like yours. My father was Black — that's why my skin is darker."

"Black?"

"It's... a word for people whose ancestors came from Africa. A long time ago."

"Africa." Tenchi tested the word. "Is that far?"

"Very far."

"Farther than America?"

"About the same, depending on where you start."

Tenchi absorbed this, nodding seriously. Then: "Is your mother here too?"

And there it was. The question Sheldon had known was coming, had been dreading since he first read the letter in his wallet.

"No," he said. "My mother died."

Tenchi's face changed. Not shock — he was too young for the full weight of that word — but recognition. Something he understood.

"My mother died too," he said quietly.


The silence stretched. Katsuhito had stopped moving at the sink.

"I know," Sheldon said, though he hadn't known, not really. The documents had mentioned Tenchi lived with his grandfather, that his father worked in the city. He'd assumed divorce, distance, the ordinary fractures of modern families. Not this.

"I don't remember her," Tenchi continued. "Grandfather shows me pictures but I don't remember her face. Just..." He touched his chest again, the same gesture from the garden. "Here. I remember here."

"That's good. That's important."

"Do you remember your mother?"

*No,* Sheldon thought. *I never met her. She never existed. She's a story someone wrote to give me a place in this world.*

But that wasn't what he said.

"I remember her voice," he heard himself say. "She used to sing to me when I was small. And I remember her hands — she had strong hands from working. And I remember the way she smelled, like green tea and something sweet."

Where were these words coming from? He didn't know. They rose up from somewhere inside him, false and true at the same time, a fiction that felt more real than memory.

"That's nice," Tenchi said. "Remembering."

"Yes."

"Does it hurt? When you remember?"

Sheldon looked at this small boy, this four-year-old who had lost his mother and didn't fully understand what that meant, who was asking questions no child should have to ask.

"Sometimes," he said honestly. "But it's a good hurt. Like good tired."

Tenchi nodded as if this made perfect sense.


## Part 5: More Questions

"Do you have a father?"

"He died too. A long time ago."

"Do you have a grandfather?"

"No. Not anymore."

"Do you have *anyone*?"

The question hit harder than Sheldon expected. Do you have anyone? He thought of his brother in Chicago, unreachable across decades and dimensions. His ex-wife, remarried, moved on. The colleagues who would have noticed his absence from the lab, eventually, when the experiments stopped running and the papers stopped appearing.

No one. He had no one.

"I have an uncle," he said. "In Osaka. I haven't seen him in a long time."

"You should see him. Uncles are family."

"You're right. Maybe I will."

Tenchi considered his next question carefully. Sheldon could see him selecting from his saved collection, weighing options.

"Why did you come here? To the shrine?"

"I was looking for my family's house. Your grandfather helped me find it."

"The empty house down the mountain?"

"Yes."

"Are you going to live there?"

"I'm going to try. It needs a lot of work first."

"I could help." Tenchi's eyes brightened. "I helped with the weeds. I could help with the house too."

"You'd have to ask your grandfather."

Both of them looked at Katsuhito, who had finished at the sink and was leaning against the counter, watching them with an expression Sheldon couldn't read.

"We'll see," the old priest said.


## Part 6: Bath and Bed

Tenchi's bath time came at seven-thirty, non-negotiable, even when there were questions left unasked. He protested — he always protested, Sheldon was learning — but Katsuhito was immovable.

"Say goodnight to Sheldon-san."

"Goodnight, Sheldon." Tenchi paused at the door. "Will you be here tomorrow?"

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

The boy smiled, that transforming expression, and disappeared toward the bathroom. A moment later, Sheldon heard water running.

Katsuhito lowered himself onto the cushion across from Sheldon, moving with that peculiar grace that seemed to belong to someone much younger than he appeared.

"He likes you," the priest said. It was the same observation from this morning, but it landed differently now, weighted with everything the day had built.

"He's a good kid."

"He is." A pause. "He lost his mother when he was two. He doesn't remember her, not really. But he feels the absence."

"I noticed."

"You handled it well. The questions about your mother." Katsuhito's eyes were steady, unreadable. "I wasn't sure how you would."

Sheldon didn't know how to respond to that. Had he handled it well? He'd lied — told a story about a woman who had never existed, painted memories that weren't his. But the emotion behind the lies had been real. The ache had been real.

"He needed to hear that remembering is okay," Sheldon said finally. "Even when it hurts."

"Yes. He did."

Silence stretched between them, comfortable rather than awkward. Outside, the evening had deepened into true dark. Stars were appearing through the window, bright and clear, undimmed by city lights.

"The bath will be free after Tenchi," Katsuhito said. "You worked hard today. You should rest."

"Thank you." For the bath. For the work. For letting me be here. For not asking questions I can't answer.

Katsuhito nodded and rose, and Sheldon was alone with the stars and the quiet and the strange, impossible life he was building.


## Part 7: Night

The bath was hot and deep and perfect.

Sheldon lowered himself into the water and felt his muscles unknot, tension he hadn't known he was carrying dissolving in the heat. The bathroom was small and traditional — wooden tub, tiled floor, a small window letting in the night air. Steam rose around him, fogging the edges of his vision.

He thought about the day. The house. The decision. The sweeping and the weeding and the small boy who asked too many questions. The curry that tasted like his grandmother's love translated into a language he didn't know he remembered.

He thought about the lies he'd told. My mother used to sing to me. I remember her hands.

Were they lies? He had a mother — Dorothy Carter, née Tanaka, who had sung to him, who had strong hands from years of nursing work. She had died when he was twenty-three, breast cancer, quick and brutal. He remembered her voice. He remembered her hands.

He'd just... transplanted those memories. Given them to a woman named Sachiko, who had also died, who had also left a son behind. The feelings were real. Only the names had changed.

Was that a lie? Or was it a kind of truth?

He didn't know. He was too tired to know.


The guest room was dark and quiet. Sheldon lay on the futon, clean and warm, exhaustion pulling at him.

His second day. His first full day in this impossible life.

He had swept a courtyard. Weeded a garden. Eaten curry. Answered a child's questions about death and loss and family. Made promises he intended to keep.

It wasn't much. It was everything.

*Tomorrow,* he thought. *Tomorrow I'll figure out more. Tomorrow I'll visit the house again, start making plans. Tomorrow I'll...*

Sleep took him mid-thought, deep and heavy, pulling him down into darkness.

He dreamed of his mother — both of them, somehow, Dorothy and Sachiko, their faces blending, their voices harmonizing on a song he couldn't quite hear. They were proud of him, he understood. They were glad he was somewhere safe.

He slept until morning.

#### Scene 3.A: Third Morning

Sheldon woke before dawn.

Not with the gasping disorientation of the first morning, not with the lingering confusion of the second. This time his eyes simply opened, and he knew where he was. The ceiling beams of the guest room had become familiar over two nights. The weight of the futon, the particular quality of mountain silence, the faint smell of cedar and old incense—these had stopped being strange and started being simply *where he was*.

He lay still for a moment, listening. Birds were beginning their dawn chorus, but tentatively, as if they weren't quite sure the sun would keep its promise. The shrine was quiet. Katsuhito would be awake soon if he wasn't already—the old priest kept farmer's hours, Sheldon had noticed. Tenchi would sleep until someone woke him, small body curled tight as a fist under his blankets.

*Day three.*

The thought arrived without drama. He was three days into... whatever this was. This life. This second chance. This existence as Tsukino Sheldon, a thirty-year-old man with money in his wallet and a childhood he couldn't remember and parents who had died loving him.

The grief that rose was familiar now, worn smooth by two days of handling it. Not his grief—not exactly. The grief for Dorothy and James Carter, for the life that had ended in that moment of white light, that remained sharp and specific. But layered over it was the borrowed grief for Sachiko and Takeo Tsukino, parents he'd never met but whose love he carried in a letter folded carefully in his wallet. Two sets of parents. Two orphanhoods. The mathematics of loss didn't add up to double—it was something stranger, grief that echoed against itself.

*Get up*, his grandmother's voice said. Not unkindly. *Lying in bed never fixed anything.*

He sat up, muscles responding easily. That still surprised him—the absence of the morning stiffness he'd grown accustomed to at forty-seven. His back didn't creak. His knees didn't protest. When he stretched his arms overhead, his shoulders moved through their full range without the familiar catch on the left side where he'd pulled something years ago.

*Eighteen years ago*, he corrected himself. *In a body that no longer exists.*

The thought was getting easier to hold. Not comfortable—he doubted it would ever be comfortable—but manageable. He was not the same man who had died. He was something new, built from the template of that man but modified in ways he was still discovering.

He folded his futon with practiced movements. His mother—Dorothy—had been particular about bed-making. *A made bed is a day that's started right*, she used to say. The muscle memory served him even now, even when the bed was a Japanese futon and the context was a mountain shrine in rural Japan.

The morning was cool when he slid open the shoji and stepped onto the engawa. The sky was lightening in the east, painting the mountains in shades of grey and pale rose. He could see his breath in small clouds. The air smelled of damp earth and green things growing—spring asserting itself despite the lingering chill.

His eyes found the tree.

He didn't mean to look for it. The great tree by the shrine office simply... caught his attention, the way a compass needle catches north. It stood massive and dark against the lightening sky, branches spreading in a pattern that seemed almost designed, too perfect to be natural but too organic to be artificial. Morning light was just beginning to touch its highest branches.

Sheldon looked away, frowning slightly. It was just a tree. An old one, impressive certainly, but nothing more than that. He'd noticed it several times now—kept noticing it—and he didn't know why. Some aesthetic appreciation for ancient things, perhaps. The scientist in him would have said it was pattern recognition, his brain flagging the unusual specimen for attention.

He went to use the bathroom, washed his face with cold water that made him gasp, and returned to find his clothes where he'd folded them the night before. The same clothes he'd woken in three days ago—slacks and a white shirt that had been cleaned and dried, though they were beginning to show the wear of being his only outfit.

*Shopping*, he thought. *At some point, I need to buy clothes.*

The thought felt absurdly normal. He was a man displaced in time and space, identity uncertain, past shrouded in mystery, and he was thinking about shopping for socks. The absurdity made him smile despite himself.

He dressed and made his way quietly toward the main residence. The shrine grounds were grey and silver in the predawn light, stone lanterns casting no shadows yet, the paths still damp with dew. He passed the main hall, passed the offering box, passed the smaller outbuilding he'd helped clean two days ago.

The kitchen light was already on.

Katsuhito stood at the counter, back to the door, doing something that involved rhythmic sounds—a knife on a cutting board, Sheldon realized. The old priest was chopping vegetables with the unhurried precision of long practice.

"Good morning," Sheldon said from the doorway.

Katsuhito didn't startle. "Good morning, Tsukino-san. You're up early."

"The birds woke me." It wasn't quite true, but it was close enough.

"Ah. The bush warblers. They've been excited lately. Mating season." Katsuhito continued his rhythmic chopping. "There's tea in the pot, if you'd like."

Sheldon entered the kitchen, moving around Katsuhito to find a cup. The layout was becoming familiar—cups in this cabinet, tea things on that shelf, the pot kept warm on a low flame. He poured for himself, then hesitated.

"May I pour you a cup as well?"

"Thank you." Katsuhito's hands never stopped their work. Daikon radish, Sheldon saw now, being reduced to precise cubes. "Set it there. I'll get to it."

Sheldon poured a second cup and set it on the counter where Katsuhito had indicated, then found a spot out of the way to stand with his own tea. The kitchen was small but efficient, designed for one person to work comfortably. Morning light was beginning to filter through the window now, warming the room degree by degree.

He watched Katsuhito work. There was something meditative about it—the steady pace, the economy of motion. The old priest had clearly been doing this for decades. His knife moved in patterns worn smooth by repetition, each cut exactly the same as the last.

"Miso soup?" Sheldon guessed.

"And rice. Pickles. Eggs." Katsuhito scraped the cubed daikon into a bowl. "A simple breakfast, but it sustains."

Sheldon found himself studying the ingredients laid out on the counter. Eggs, yes—probably from the shrine's chickens, which he'd heard but not yet seen. Green onions. The rice cooker sat in the corner, already doing its work, the small light indicating the cycle was in progress.

His mother had cooked. Dorothy Carter had made Sunday dinners that could feed an army, raised-in-the-church Southern cooking that filled the house with smells of collard greens and cornbread and slow-simmered meats. He'd learned the basics from her, enough to survive as a bachelor academic—eggs, simple pastas, the occasional roasted chicken when he felt ambitious.

But watching Katsuhito work, he became aware of how much he didn't know. Japanese cooking was a different vocabulary entirely. The ingredients were familiar enough—vegetables, protein, rice—but the grammar was foreign. The way things were cut, the sequence of preparation, the subtle dance of timing that produced a meal rather than a collection of dishes.

"Is there something I can help with?" The question emerged before he'd fully formed the thought.

Katsuhito paused in his chopping. Turned slightly to regard Sheldon with those eyes that seemed to see more than they should. "Can you cook?"

"I can... manage. Simple things." Sheldon felt suddenly self-conscious. "My mother taught me the basics. American cooking, though. Southern. I don't know—" He gestured vaguely at the ingredients on the counter. "I don't know this."

"This," Katsuhito said, turning back to his cutting board, "can be learned."

It was neither an invitation nor a refusal. Just a statement of fact. Sheldon sipped his tea and watched as Katsuhito moved on to slicing green onions, the rings falling from his knife in paper-thin circles.

"The eggs are not complicated," Katsuhito said after a moment. "Tamagoyaki—the rolled omelet. Tenchi's favorite. If you wish to try."

Sheldon's hands wanted to say yes before his brain caught up. He set down his tea cup. "Show me?"

What followed was a lesson in three acts.

First: the eggs. Crack them into a bowl—easy enough. Add a small splash of dashi, the fish stock that was apparently the foundation of all things. A little sugar, a little soy sauce. Beat them smooth, but not too much, not until they foam.

Second: the pan. Small, rectangular, specifically designed for this one task. Heat it, oil it lightly, wait until a drop of egg mixture sizzled immediately but didn't burn.

Third: the technique. Pour a thin layer. Let it set. Roll it toward you using chopsticks. Push the rolled portion to the far end of the pan. Add more egg mixture. Let it set. Roll again. Layer upon layer, building the omelet through repetition rather than all at once.

Sheldon's first attempt was... educational.

"Too much heat," Katsuhito observed as brown patches appeared where golden was desired. "The pan runs hot at the edges."

His second attempt was better. Not good—the roll was lumpy, the layers uneven—but edible. It would not win any awards, but it was recognizably tamagoyaki.

"Again," Katsuhito said, and there was something almost like approval in his voice. "Tomorrow."

By the time Tenchi stumbled into the kitchen, still half-asleep and listing to one side like a small ship in rough water, there was breakfast on the table. Rice, miso soup with daikon and green onion, pickled vegetables, and two tamagoyaki—one perfect golden log, one somewhat irregular companion.

"Sheldon-san made the eggs," Katsuhito announced, settling onto his cushion.

Tenchi blinked at the table, then at Sheldon, then at the eggs. His face underwent a complicated journey from sleepy confusion to cautious interest.

"Which ones?" the boy asked.

"The ugly one," Sheldon said, straight-faced.

Tenchi considered this. Reached out and, with the decisive certainty of childhood, selected the irregular omelet for his own plate.

"I like ugly eggs," he said. "They taste like adventure."

Sheldon felt something shift in his chest. Something small and warm, taking root.

"Then tomorrow," he said, "I'll make sure to make them even uglier."

Tenchi's smile was the brightest thing in the room.


- Tenchi prefers the "adventure" of imperfect food

**Foreshadowing Maintained:**
- Funaho draw continues (eyes find the tree, dismissed as aesthetic appreciation)
- Body restoration noted (no morning stiffness, full range of motion)
- Supreme Chef seed watered (interest in learning, hands wanting to cook)

**Character Development:**
- Sheldon: Actively seeking ways to contribute; cooking as connection
- Katsuhito: Teaching without fanfare; "can be learned" = invitation through understatement
- Tenchi: "Ugly eggs taste like adventure" — childlike wisdom, choosing Sheldon's work

**Relationship Progress:**
- Sheldon → Katsuhito: Moving from guest to student (cooking lesson)
- Sheldon → Tenchi: Deepening bond through food, humor, presence

**Seeds Planted:**
- "Again. Tomorrow." — establishes cooking will become routine
- Shopping needed for clothes — mundane needs grounding the extraordinary
- Kitchen becomes a space for connection

#### Scene 3.B: The Village

"You'll need to go into the village eventually."

Katsuhito said it casually, not looking up from the accounts ledger he was reviewing at the low table. Sheldon had been helping Tenchi feed the chickens—a task that mostly involved the boy chasing the birds while Sheldon scattered grain in their actual direction—and had returned to find the old priest in a contemplative mood.

"I was thinking the same thing." Sheldon looked down at himself. The white shirt was holding up, but barely. The slacks had a grass stain on one knee from yesterday's garden work that hadn't quite come out. "I need clothes. Supplies. I can't keep borrowing your soap."

"The village has what you need. Small shops, but sufficient." Katsuhito turned a page. "Take the path down from the shrine—not the main steps. There's a forest trail that joins the road near the bridge. Faster, and less climbing on the return."

Sheldon filed this information away. "Is there a particular shop you'd recommend?"

"Tanaka's, for clothing. Tell them you're staying at the shrine. They'll understand." A pause. "The general store is Mori's. The woman who runs it—Mori Fumiko—she talks. Be prepared."

There was something almost like humor in Katsuhito's voice. Sheldon found himself smiling. "Warning received."

"Tenchi." Katsuhito raised his voice slightly. The boy appeared in the doorway with suspicious speed, suggesting he'd been hovering just out of sight. "Would you like to show Tsukino-san the way to the village?"

Tenchi's face underwent a rapid transformation from caught-eavesdropping guilt to barely contained excitement. "Can I? Really?"

"If Tsukino-san doesn't mind the company."

Sheldon looked at the boy—four years old, nearly five, vibrating with the prospect of an outing. "I'd appreciate the guide," he said. "I might get lost otherwise."

This was, of course, ridiculous. The path to the village couldn't be that complicated. But Tenchi didn't need to know that, and the way his whole small body lit up at being given a responsibility was worth the small fiction.

"I know all the shortcuts!" Tenchi announced. "And I can show you where the really big fish live in the river!"

"Fish viewing will have to wait for another day," Katsuhito said mildly. "Shopping first. Perhaps Tsukino-san will buy you a treat if you're helpful."

Tenchi's eyes went very wide. He looked at Sheldon with an expression of profound hope.

"We'll see," Sheldon said, and that seemed to be enough.


The forest path was exactly as Katsuhito had described—a narrow track through cedar and cypress that wound down the mountainside at a gentler grade than the shrine's 320 steps. Tenchi led the way with the confidence of long familiarity, occasionally pointing out landmarks with the gravity of a seasoned guide.

"That's the rock that looks like a frog," he announced, indicating a moss-covered boulder that, with generous imagination, might have resembled an amphibian. "And that tree has a hole where an owl lives. I've never seen the owl, but Grandfather says it's there."

"Maybe it's shy," Sheldon offered.

"Maybe." Tenchi considered this. "I would be shy too, if I lived in a tree and people kept looking at my house."

The logic was unassailable.

The path emerged onto a paved road after perhaps twenty minutes of walking. The river Katsuhito had mentioned ran alongside it, wide and shallow at this point, sunlight glinting off the water. Tenchi gave it a longing look but kept walking, responsibility outweighing temptation.

The village announced itself gradually—first a few houses, then a small shrine (not Masaki, a simpler affair with a single torii gate), then the beginnings of a commercial street. It was not large. A single main road with perhaps two dozen shops, houses clustered behind them, everything scaled to human measure. No buildings over two stories. Bicycles parked outside the grocer's. An old woman sweeping the sidewalk in front of what appeared to be a pharmacy.

Sheldon's last experience with small-town Japan had been thirty years ago in another life—a semester abroad that had taken him through villages not unlike this one. The details had blurred with time, but the *feeling* came back now: the particular quiet of a Japanese town mid-morning, the careful arrangement of everything, the sense that each building knew its place and purpose.

"Tanaka's is there," Tenchi said, pointing to a shop with clothing displayed in the window. "And Mori's is there." He pointed across the street to a larger establishment with a sign advertising everything from rice to farm tools. "Grandfather says Mori-san talks too much, but she gives me candy sometimes."

"That seems like a fair trade."

They went to Tanaka's first.

The shop was dim and cool, racks of clothing arranged by type and size. A bell chimed as they entered, and a moment later, a man emerged from a back room—middle-aged, neat in a way that suggested he took his profession seriously, dark hair silvering at the temples.

"Ah, Tenchi-kun! What brings you down from the mountain?" His eyes moved to Sheldon, curious but not unfriendly. "And you've brought a guest."

"This is Tsukino-san," Tenchi announced with evident pride. "He's staying at the shrine. He needs clothes because he only has one outfit and it's getting dirty."

The bluntness of childhood. Sheldon felt heat rise in his face, but Tanaka merely smiled.

"Traveling light, I see. Well, we can help with that." He was already assessing Sheldon with a professional eye—height, shoulder width, the length of his arms. "Western or Japanese style?"

"Both, perhaps? I'll need work clothes. Something practical."

What followed was an efficient transaction. Tanaka produced options with minimal fuss—two pairs of durable trousers, three shirts in muted colors, undergarments, socks. When Sheldon mentioned he'd be doing repairs on an old house, Tanaka added a set of work clothes to the pile: heavy cotton pants and a jacket that would stand up to rough use.

"The Tsukino house," Tanaka said as he folded the items. It wasn't a question. "Word travels. You're the nephew, then? Kiyoshi-san's family?"

"His nephew, yes." The lie—or the partial truth, or whatever it was—came easier each time. "I'm here to see about the property."

"Good. It's been sitting too long." Tanaka's hands moved with practiced efficiency, wrapping the clothing in brown paper. "A house needs people in it, or it forgets what it's for. Fifteen thousand yen for everything."

Sheldon paid from the cash in his wallet, watching the bills disappear into Tanaka's register with something like relief. The transaction felt normal. Ordinary. A man buying clothes in a village shop. No mystery to it at all.

"Mori-san will have anything else you need," Tanaka said as he handed over the wrapped package. "Soap, cleaning supplies, whatever. Tell her I sent you—she'll only talk your ear off for twenty minutes instead of thirty."

"That's what Grandfather said too," Tenchi confided. "About the talking."

Tanaka's smile widened. "The priest is a wise man."


Mori's General Store was everything Tanaka's shop was not—cluttered, overflowing, chaotic in a way that somehow still made sense. Shelves lined every wall, stacked with goods that ranged from kitchen supplies to farming equipment to imported snacks in bright packaging. The smell was complex: soap and incense and dried fish and something sweet that Sheldon couldn't identify.

The woman behind the counter matched her store: small, energetic, with sharp eyes that missed nothing and a mouth that apparently never stopped moving.

"Tenchi-kun! And—oh! You must be the man staying at the shrine. The nephew! Kiyoshi-san's boy, yes? Though you're not a boy anymore, are you? How old are you? You look young. Good skin. Do you moisturize? The air up by the shrine is very dry, you know, especially in winter, but it's spring now so it should be fine. What do you need? Soap? I have soap. Seven kinds. The lavender is popular with the women, but men like the hinoki cypress, very traditional. Are you traditional?"

Sheldon opened his mouth to answer, but Mori Fumiko was already moving, pulling items from shelves with an efficiency that belied her apparent scatter.

"Toothpaste, you'll need toothpaste. And a brush. We have the new ones from Osaka, very modern. Do you want modern or traditional? The traditional ones are bamboo, very nice, very authentic. Cleaning supplies? The house has been empty four years—four years! Such a shame. Sachiko-san was a lovely woman. You have her eyes, did you know that? No, you wouldn't know that, you never met her, isn't that sad? Family should be together, but everyone goes to the cities now. Not you, though! You came back. That's good. That's very good."

She paused for breath—the first pause since he'd walked in—and Sheldon seized the opportunity.

"Soap, please. The hinoki. A toothbrush—traditional is fine. And whatever cleaning supplies you'd recommend for a house that's been closed up."

Mori beamed at him as though he'd passed a test. "Smart man. Listen, take advice, don't argue. Your uncle is the same way—stubborn, but he listens eventually. I have just the thing. Sachiko-san always bought this brand—" She produced a bucket and a selection of bottles with the air of a magician revealing her best trick. "Floors, windows, bathroom. Everything you need. And I'll give you a discount because you're new and because the priest is a good man and because Tenchi-kun is my favorite customer, yes you are."

She reached under the counter and produced a small paper bag. Candy. She pressed it into Tenchi's hands with conspiratorial solemnity.

"For being a good guide," she said. "Don't tell your grandfather I'm spoiling you."

"I won't," Tenchi said, which was almost certainly a lie.

The total came to two thousand yen, which seemed reasonable given the quantity of supplies. Sheldon paid, accepted the paper bags Mori pressed upon him, and managed to escape the shop only after promising to return when he needed more supplies—which Mori assured him would be very soon, because a house that had been empty four years would need more cleaning than he expected, mark her words.

Outside, the midday sun was warm. Tenchi was already investigating his candy with the focused intensity of a researcher examining rare specimens.

"She's nice," the boy concluded, selecting a small wrapped sweet. "She talks a lot, but she always gives me candy."

"A reasonable assessment." Sheldon shifted the packages in his arms, finding a comfortable arrangement. His purchases formed a satisfying weight—tangible evidence of belonging, of staying, of building a life here. "Should we head back? Or is there something else you wanted to show me?"

Tenchi considered, unwrapping his candy with careful attention. "The river?"

"The river," Sheldon agreed.

They found a spot on the bank where the water ran clear and shallow, and Tenchi pointed out the rocks where fish supposedly gathered. Sheldon couldn't see any fish, but Tenchi assured him they were there, and that seemed true enough.

The candy was melon-flavored. Tenchi offered to share. Sheldon accepted.

Sitting on the riverbank with a four-year-old, eating melon candy and watching for fish that may or may not have existed, Sheldon felt something settle in his chest. Something that had been clenched began to loosen.

*This is real*, he thought. *Whatever else is true—however I got here, whoever I was—this is real. This boy, this candy, this river, this sun.*

The walk back up the mountain took longer than the walk down, burdened as he was with packages. But Tenchi kept up a steady commentary on the trees, the rocks, the birds they passed, and the time went quickly.

By the time they reached the shrine, it was early afternoon. Sheldon's arms ached pleasantly from the weight of his purchases. His feet were tired. He was, he realized with something like wonder, happy.

Not the complicated happiness of achievement or the sharp happiness of surprise. Just the simple, steady happiness of a day spent well in good company.

He'd buy groceries tomorrow, he decided. And he'd cook dinner.

#### Scene 3.C: The Afternoon

The shrine was quiet when they returned.

Katsuhito was not in the main residence, though the low table still held his ledger and pen, set aside as if he'd only stepped out for a moment. Tenchi immediately claimed a cushion and began extracting his candy from the paper bag with the focused deliberation of a surgeon, sorting the sweets by color and type into small piles on the tatami.

Sheldon set his packages down by the wall and stretched, working the stiffness from his shoulders. The walk uphill had been longer than the walk down, the weight of his purchases making itself felt in muscles that, while restored, were not yet hardened to this kind of labor.

"I'm going to put these away," he said to Tenchi, who nodded without looking up from his inventory.

The guest room was as he'd left it—futon folded, his few possessions arranged neatly in the corner. The room felt different now, though. Less borrowed. He'd slept here two nights. He'd been given tea here, been welcomed here. The space was beginning to hold his shape.

He unwrapped his packages on the floor, laying out the new clothes in neat stacks. Two pairs of trousers—one charcoal, one brown. Three shirts in muted colors that Tanaka had selected without consultation but that Sheldon found himself approving: a soft grey, a pale blue, a cream that would hide dirt poorly but felt good against his skin when he tried it on. The work clothes were heavier, practical—the kind of thing you wore when you expected to get dirty.

He changed into one of the new shirts, tucking it into his old slacks. The fabric was crisp, unfamiliar. He caught himself smoothing it unnecessarily.

*Shopping*, he thought again. *I went shopping. Like a person who lives here.*

The cleaning supplies went into a corner. He'd need to visit the Tsukino house soon—tomorrow, perhaps—to assess what needed to be done. The thought of it stirred something complicated in his chest. A house that had belonged to parents he'd never met, waiting empty for a son who had never existed until three days ago.

*Or who had existed, and who had been somewhere else for two years.*

The ID said he'd arrived in 1987. The house had been empty since 1985. Where had he been for those two years? What had he been doing? The gap in his memory was a shape he could feel but not see, like a room he knew existed but couldn't find the door to.

He pushed the thought aside. There would be time for mysteries later. Right now, there was an afternoon to fill.


He found Katsuhito in the garden.

The old priest was kneeling in the vegetable beds, hands working steadily through the soil around a row of young plants. He didn't look up as Sheldon approached, but there was a subtle shift in his posture—acknowledgment without interruption.

"The village trip went well?" Katsuhito asked.

"Very." Sheldon crouched at the edge of the bed, careful not to disturb anything. "Tanaka was helpful. Mori-san was... thorough."

"Ah. She talked your ear off."

"Both ears. And possibly my nose."

Katsuhito's hands paused. When he looked up, there was something that might have been amusement around his eyes. "She means well. She remembers everyone who's ever passed through the village, and she believes everyone should know everything she remembers."

"She mentioned my—" Sheldon caught himself. "She mentioned Sachiko. Said I have her eyes."

Katsuhito returned to his work, but Sheldon caught the slight tension in his shoulders. "Mori-san knew the Tsukino family. Most of the village did. They were..." He seemed to search for the right word. "Present. Sachiko-san in particular. She had opinions, and she shared them."

"That sounds like someone I would have—" *Loved.* The word stuck in his throat. "Respected."

"She was respected. And loved." Katsuhito pulled a weed with more force than seemed necessary. "The village mourned when she passed."

Sheldon watched the old priest's hands move through the soil. There were questions he wanted to ask—about Sachiko, about Takeo, about the house and the family and the life that had ended before he'd arrived to inherit its remnants. But something in Katsuhito's silence suggested that this was not the moment.

"May I help?" he asked instead.

Katsuhito gestured to a patch of ground beside him. "The weeds don't pull themselves."


They worked in companionable silence for nearly an hour.

The garden was larger than Sheldon had realized, extending behind the residence in terraced beds that climbed the slope in neat rectangles. Vegetables occupied most of the space—daikon, carrots, onions, leafy greens he couldn't identify—but there were herbs too, clustered near the kitchen door where they could be harvested easily. He recognized some from his mother's garden in Georgia: basil, something that looked like rosemary. Others were new to him, their scents unfamiliar but not unpleasant.

The soil was good. He'd taken a geology elective in undergrad, learned enough to recognize healthy loam when he saw it. Dark, rich, full of organic matter. Someone—Katsuhito, presumably—had been tending this garden for years, building the soil season by season.

His hands remembered weeding. Dorothy had kept a vegetable garden behind the house in Atlanta, and summers had meant hours of work in the heat, pulling out the endless creeping grasses and broadleaves that tried to swallow her tomatoes. He'd complained at the time, a teenager convinced that manual labor was beneath a future scientist. Now the muscle memory was a comfort, something his body knew how to do without consultation.

Tenchi appeared around two o'clock, candy consumption apparently complete, and inserted himself into the work with the easy confidence of a child who'd done this before. His small hands were surprisingly efficient, finding weeds that Sheldon had missed and extracting them with practiced tugs.

"This one's not a weed," Tenchi informed him, pointing to a plant Sheldon had been about to pull. "That's shiso. Grandfather uses it for pickling."

"Ah." Sheldon withdrew his hand. "Thank you. I would have murdered an innocent herb."

"Grandfather says plants don't have feelings. But I think they might." Tenchi patted the shiso leaves gently. "I always say sorry when I pick them."

"That seems wise."

They worked their way down the row together, Tenchi providing commentary on each plant they encountered. The boy's knowledge was impressive for his age—he knew which vegetables were ready to harvest and which needed more time, which plants liked sun and which preferred shade, which bugs were helpful and which were pests.

"Grandmother taught me," Tenchi said when Sheldon commented on his expertise. "Before she went away."

Sheldon's hands stilled. "Your grandmother?"

"Grandfather's wife. She died when I was little. I don't remember her very well." Tenchi pulled a weed, frowning at the dirt under his fingernails. "But I remember she had a garden. And she used to sing while she worked."

"Do you remember the songs?"

Tenchi hummed a few notes—something minor-key and meandering, more impression than melody. "I don't remember the words. Just the sound."

Sheldon felt something tighten in his chest. This boy, not yet five, had already lost two women who'd loved him. His mother, dead. His grandmother, dead. The world was greedy with its takings.

"My grandmother used to sing too," he said. "Gospel music, mostly. Songs about light and hope and being carried home."

"What's gospel?"

"Church music. Music about God and faith and..." He searched for words a four-year-old might understand. "Music about believing that things will be okay, even when they're hard."

Tenchi considered this with the gravity only a child could muster. "Did your grandmother go away too?"

"Yes. A long time ago."

"Do you miss her?"

The question was simple, direct. Children asked such things because they didn't know yet that some questions had complicated answers.

"Every day," Sheldon said. "But I also remember her. And that helps."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied. He returned to his weeding with renewed focus, small hands moving efficiently through the soil.


By three-thirty, the afternoon light had shifted to gold, and Sheldon's back was beginning to protest. They had cleared four beds of weeds and turned the soil in two more. Katsuhito had disappeared at some point—back to his ledgers, Sheldon assumed—leaving Sheldon and Tenchi to finish the work.

"I'm hungry," Tenchi announced, sitting back on his heels.

"It's too early for dinner." Sheldon stretched, feeling his spine pop in several places. "But we could have a snack."

"What kind of snack?"

The question sparked something in Sheldon's mind. The kitchen. The ingredients he'd seen that morning—rice, vegetables, the remains of yesterday's curry. And the cleaning supplies he'd bought, waiting in his room.

"I have an idea," he said. "But I need to check something first."


The kitchen was empty when they entered, afternoon light slanting through the window in long rectangles across the floor. Sheldon surveyed the space with new eyes—not as a guest looking for tea, but as someone assessing possibilities.

The pantry was better stocked than he'd expected. Rice, of course—multiple varieties, he noted, stored in large covered containers. Dried goods: beans, noodles, various things in packages he couldn't read. Fresh vegetables, some from the garden. Eggs from the chickens. Small containers of sauces and seasonings, arranged with the same careful organization he'd seen in everything Katsuhito touched.

*What do I know how to make?*

The question turned over in his mind. He knew Southern cooking—comfort food, his mother's recipes, the kind of thing that required ingredients not easily found in rural Japan. He knew bachelor cooking—pasta, scrambled eggs, sandwiches. He knew how to follow a recipe, but he'd never been adventurous.

But this morning. The tamagoyaki. His hands had wanted to learn. And watching Katsuhito's measured movements, watching the rice cooker cycle through its stages, he'd felt something stir. A curiosity. A pull toward understanding.

"Can you make onigiri?" Tenchi asked, appearing at his elbow.

"Rice balls?" Sheldon had eaten them, once, at a Japanese restaurant in Chicago. Simple triangles of rice, sometimes wrapped in seaweed. "I've never tried. Do you know how?"

Tenchi nodded eagerly. "Grandmother showed me! You cook the rice, and then you wet your hands, and then you squeeze it." He mimed the motion, small hands pressing together. "And you can put things inside. Like umeboshi. Or salmon."

"Do we have salmon?"

"No. But we have umeboshi!" Tenchi pointed to a jar on a shelf—small, pickled plums that Sheldon had noticed but not investigated. "They're sour but good."

*Rice balls with pickled plum.* It was simple. It was manageable. It was something he could learn.

"Show me," Sheldon said.

What followed was an education.

Tenchi's knowledge was fragmentary but enthusiastic. He knew the basics—wet your hands to prevent sticking, use salt on your palms, cup the rice and press gently but firmly—but the finer points escaped him. His demonstration produced a rice ball that was more sphere than triangle, lopsided and leaking grains.

"It's supposed to look nicer," he admitted, frowning at his creation. "Grandmother's were perfect."

"Let me try."

Sheldon wet his hands, salted them, and took a portion of the rice. It was warm from the cooker, slightly sticky, pleasant against his skin. He cupped it in his left palm and began to press, rotating the ball slowly, trying to form the triangular shape he remembered.

His first attempt was worse than Tenchi's—a misshapen lump that fell apart when he tried to set it down.

His second was better. Not good, but better. The rice held together, formed something approximately triangular if he squinted.

His third...

Something shifted.

He couldn't explain it afterward, couldn't point to the exact moment when his hands seemed to understand what his mind didn't. But on the third attempt, the rice responded differently. The pressure felt right. The rotation felt natural. The shape emerged not through force but through some kind of negotiation between his intention and the material.

The onigiri that formed was perfect.

Not adequate. Not passable. *Perfect.* Crisp edges, smooth surfaces, the kind of thing you'd see in a shop window. He stared at it, sitting in his palm like a small white monument.

"Wow," Tenchi breathed.

Sheldon made another one. And another. Each emerged from his hands with the same unlikely precision, as if his fingers had been doing this for years. He pressed a cavity into one, added an umeboshi, closed the rice around it and shaped it smooth. Wrapped it in a strip of nori seaweed that he found in a packet near the rice.

"You're really good at this," Tenchi said.

"I..." Sheldon looked at the row of onigiri on the cutting board. Five of them, identical, professional-quality. "I don't know how I'm doing this."

But his hands did. His hands knew exactly what they were doing.


They ate their snack on the engawa, watching the afternoon fade toward evening.

The onigiri were good. Better than good. The rice had a texture that Sheldon didn't remember achieving, a slight chewiness that gave way to softness. The umeboshi inside provided a bright counterpoint, salty and sour against the neutral grain.

Tenchi ate two before remembering to pace himself, then ate a third anyway.

"These are as good as grandmother's," he said, and there was wonder in his voice.

Sheldon didn't know what to say. He'd never made onigiri before today. He'd never even formed rice in his hands before this morning's failed tamagoyaki. And yet somehow, on his third attempt, he'd produced something that a four-year-old compared favorably to his dead grandmother's cooking.

*Something is happening to me.*

The thought was neither alarming nor comforting. It was simply true. Something was different. Something was changing. Whether it was something that had always been there, waiting to emerge, or something new—something given—he couldn't say.

His eyes drifted across the shrine grounds, and he found the tree again. The massive trunk, the spreading branches, the quality of presence that seemed to fill the air around it.

*Just a tree*, he told himself.

But his hands still tingled with the memory of rice taking shape beneath them, responding to pressure he hadn't known he could apply.

*Just a tree. Just rice. Just a coincidence.*

He ate another onigiri and watched the shadows lengthen across the stones.

#### Scene 3.D: Late Afternoon

The shadows had grown long across the shrine grounds by the time Tenchi finished his third onigiri.

The boy sat cross-legged on the engawa, small legs tucked beneath him, watching the afternoon fade with the particular intensity children brought to simple moments. He'd stopped talking somewhere in the middle of his second rice ball, settling into a companionable quiet that Sheldon found surprisingly comfortable.

"Grandfather will wonder where we are," Tenchi said eventually.

"He probably knows." Sheldon had seen Katsuhito glance their way earlier, a brief acknowledgment from across the courtyard before disappearing into the main hall. The old priest seemed to have a sense for where everyone was at any given moment—not intrusive, just... aware.

"He always knows." Tenchi picked a grain of rice from his sleeve and ate it. "Mother used to say he had eyes in the back of his head. But I looked once, and he doesn't. Just regular hair."

The casual mention of his mother made Sheldon's chest tighten. This was the first time Tenchi had mentioned her directly—not his grandmother, but his mother. The woman who had died and left this small boy motherless.

"My mother used to say the same thing about my grandmother," Sheldon said carefully. "I think it's something mothers say."

"Did your grandmother have eyes in the back of her head?"

"No. But she always seemed to know when I was doing something I shouldn't be doing."

Tenchi nodded, accepting this as universal truth. "Grandfather is like that too." He stood, brushing rice from his lap with the unselfconscious thoroughness of childhood. "I should wash my hands before dinner. Grandfather says dirty hands at the table are rude."

"Good manners," Sheldon agreed.

He watched the boy pad inside, small feet quiet on the wooden floor, and found himself alone on the engawa with the dregs of afternoon.

The tree caught his attention again.

It stood in the slanting golden light, its massive trunk throwing a shadow that stretched nearly to the steps. Something about it in this light—the way the bark seemed to hold warmth, the slight movement of branches in a breeze he couldn't feel—made it hard to look away.

*Beautiful*, he thought. *Old. Patient.*

He blinked and turned away. Enough staring at trees.


The kitchen was empty when he entered, but signs of preparation had begun. A pot sat on the counter, waiting. Vegetables had been set out—daikon, carrots, what looked like burdock root. A piece of fish wrapped in paper rested near the sink.

Someone had started dinner, then been called away.

Sheldon stood in the doorway, uncertain. This wasn't his kitchen. He'd been a guest here for three days. But his hands remembered the feel of rice between his palms, the unexpected rightness of the onigiri taking shape, and something in him wanted to continue.

*Itadakimasu*, he thought. Not for eating—for beginning. For receiving.

He washed his hands at the sink, cold water shocking against skin still warm from the afternoon sun. Dried them on the cloth hanging nearby. Surveyed the ingredients again.

The fish was mackerel. He could tell by the silver-blue skin, the particular pattern of stripes. His mother had never cooked mackerel—too strong for her taste, she'd said—but he'd eaten it at that Japanese restaurant in Chicago, grilled with salt and served with grated radish.

*Yakizakana*. The word surfaced from somewhere, clear and certain. Grilled fish.

He didn't know when he'd learned that word. It felt like something he'd always known.

The vegetables were for simmered dishes—he could see that much. Daikon and carrots cut into chunks, slow-cooked in broth until tender. The burdock root would need to be cleaned, scraped, its earthy bitterness balanced with sweetness and soy.

*Nimono*. Simmered things.

His hands wanted to move. He let them.


The fish went first into a bath of salt, drawing moisture from the skin to ensure crispness when grilled. While it sat, he turned to the vegetables.

The daikon came apart under his knife in thick rounds, then quarters. His cuts were clean, even—not the awkward hackwork he would have expected from himself. The knife felt comfortable in his grip, the angle of the blade natural against the cutting board.

Carrots followed. He cut them at an angle, the way he'd seen—where had he seen it? In a cookbook? On television?—the bias cut that allowed more surface area to absorb flavor.

The burdock root was different. He scraped it with the back of the knife, removing the thin outer layer without losing the flesh beneath. Then shaved it into ribbons that curled as they fell, dropping them immediately into cold water to prevent browning.

He worked without thinking. Or rather, he worked while thinking about other things—Tenchi's casual mention of his mother, the way the afternoon light had caught the tree, the feel of rice between his palms—and his hands continued their task as if they belonged to someone else. Someone who knew what they were doing.

*This isn't normal.*

The thought surfaced and he let it float there, neither accepting nor rejecting it. Something was different. Something had changed, or was changing, or had always been this way and he was only now noticing. The onigiri had been the first clear sign, but now, watching his hands move through preparation steps he'd never learned, he couldn't pretend it was coincidence.

He set a pot of water to boil for the rice. Measured out enough for three, then added a bit more—he was hungrier than usual after the day's work, and he suspected Katsuhito and Tenchi were as well. The rice went into the cooker with practiced motions, water added by feel rather than measurement, and he set it going before he could question how he knew the right proportions.

The fish came out of its salt bath and went under the grill.

The vegetables went into a pot with dashi—the stock he found already made in a container in the refrigerator, clear and golden—along with soy sauce, mirin, and a pinch of sugar. He brought it to a simmer and lowered the heat, letting time do the work.

He was cleaning the burdock ribbons, preparing to add them to the pot, when Katsuhito appeared in the doorway.


The old priest said nothing for a long moment.

He stood at the threshold, watching Sheldon work with an expression that might have been curiosity or might have been something else entirely. His eyes moved from the fish under the grill to the simmering pot to Sheldon's hands, still holding the dripping burdock.

"I was going to make dinner," Katsuhito said finally.

"I—" Sheldon stopped. What could he say? *I started cooking and couldn't stop?* *My hands know things I don't remember learning?* "I hope you don't mind. I wanted to help."

"Help." Katsuhito entered the kitchen, moving to check the fish. He lifted the edge with chopsticks, examining the underside. "This is well-seasoned."

"I salted it first. To draw out moisture."

"I know the technique." There was something careful in Katsuhito's voice. "Where did you learn it?"

Sheldon's hands paused over the burdock. "I don't know," he admitted. "I've never cooked fish before. Not like this."

The silence stretched between them, filled with the sound of simmering broth and the faint hiss of fish fat dripping onto coals.

"The onigiri," Katsuhito said. "Tenchi showed me. He said you made them."

"We made them together. He taught me how—or tried to. My first two attempts were..." Sheldon searched for the right word. "Educational."

"And the third?"

"Different."

Katsuhito nodded slowly, as if this confirmed something he'd suspected. "Different," he repeated. "Yes. Tenchi said they were perfect. He said they were as good as his grandmother's." A pause. "My wife made onigiri for forty years. She was very skilled."

The weight of that statement settled over Sheldon like a blanket. He'd been compared to a woman who had forty years of practice, and he'd met that standard on his third attempt.

"I don't understand it either," he said quietly. "I don't know how I'm doing this."

"No." Katsuhito's eyes met his, and for a moment Sheldon felt seen in a way that was almost uncomfortable—not invasive, but penetrating, as if the old priest was reading something written beneath his skin. "But you are doing it. That is what matters."

He moved past Sheldon to check the simmered vegetables, lifting the lid and inhaling the steam with an approving nod. "This will be ready soon. The fish needs another few minutes." He set the lid back down. "I will set the table. You will finish here."

It wasn't a question. It was permission—or perhaps acknowledgment. Sheldon wasn't sure which.

"Thank you," he said.

Katsuhito paused at the doorway. "My wife would have liked you," he said, not looking back. "She always said cooking was listening. Listening to the ingredients, to the heat, to the moment." A slight inclination of his head. "You listen well, Tsukino-san."

Then he was gone, and Sheldon was alone with the fish and the vegetables and the strange certainty that something fundamental was shifting beneath his feet.


Dinner was served at six-thirty.

The low table was set with three places, each with its own arrangement of dishes—rice in individual bowls, miso soup in lacquered containers, the grilled mackerel on rectangular plates, the simmered vegetables in small bowls. Everything in its proper place, every flavor distinct, the meal laid out with the care of a ritual.

Sheldon had done this. He'd made this food, arranged these plates, created this moment. And he still didn't fully understand how.

They sat in seiza—Sheldon's knees protesting only faintly, another small surprise—and Katsuhito led them in the evening prayer. Then the word that began all meals:

"Itadakimasu."

Tenchi attacked his food with the single-minded focus of a child who had spent the afternoon weeding a garden and eating only rice balls for sustenance. The mackerel disappeared in alarming quantities. The vegetables were consumed without complaint, which Sheldon suspected was unusual based on Katsuhito's slightly raised eyebrow.

The old priest ate more slowly, savoring each bite with deliberate attention. He said nothing about the food, but his silence spoke its own language—approval, perhaps even surprise, communicated through the thoroughness with which he cleaned each dish.

Sheldon ate his own portion with a strange detachment. The food was good. Better than good—the mackerel was perfectly crisp on the outside, moist within, the salt bringing out its rich flavor rather than overwhelming it. The vegetables had absorbed the broth beautifully, each bite offering a depth of flavor that seemed impossible given how simply he'd prepared them.

*I made this.*

The thought kept circling back, insistent and bewildering.

*I made this, and I don't know how.*

"More rice?" Katsuhito asked, and Sheldon realized his bowl was empty.

"Please."

The old priest served him with the same economical movements he brought to everything. "You will cook again tomorrow?"

It was phrased as a question, but something in his tone made it clear what answer he expected.

"If you'd like me to," Sheldon said.

"I would like that very much."

Tenchi looked up from his third helping of mackerel. "Can you make curry? I like curry."

"I..." Sheldon thought of the curry he'd eaten two nights ago, the complexity of its spice blend, the way the flavors had layered and built. Could he make that? He didn't know. But his hands tingled with something that might have been anticipation. "I can try."

"Tomorrow?" The hope in Tenchi's voice was painfully earnest.

"Tomorrow," Sheldon agreed, and watched the boy's face light up like sunrise.

Across the table, Katsuhito said nothing. But the faint smile at the corner of his mouth said enough.

#### Scene 3.E: Evening

The dishes were a simple matter.

Sheldon had offered to wash them, and Katsuhito had accepted with a nod that suggested this was expected—not demanded, but hoped for. The kitchen was quiet except for the sound of running water and the clink of ceramic against ceramic. Outside the small window over the sink, the sky had deepened from gold to purple to the first true darkness of night.

Tenchi had been excused to prepare for his bath. Sheldon could hear him somewhere in the house, small feet padding on wooden floors, the occasional thump of something being set down or picked up. The sounds of a child's evening routine, unremarkable and somehow precious.

"You have done well today."

Katsuhito's voice came from behind him. The old priest had returned to the kitchen doorway, arms folded into his sleeves in that characteristic posture of his.

"The food, you mean?" Sheldon scrubbed at a rice bowl, though it was already clean.

"The food. The garden. The village." A pause. "Being present."

Sheldon wasn't sure how to respond to that. Being present seemed like the least one could do—simply existing where you were, paying attention. But something in Katsuhito's tone suggested it was not, in fact, the least. That presence was its own form of effort.

"Tenchi will want to say goodnight to you," Katsuhito continued. "After his bath. He asked."

"Of course."

"He doesn't ask everyone." The old priest's eyes were steady on Sheldon's back. "He's particular about who he trusts. Like his mother was."

Another mention of Tenchi's mother—twice in one day now, after none in the previous two. Sheldon filed this away, uncertain what it meant but sensing it was significant.

"I'm honored," he said, and meant it.


The bath at the Masaki shrine was traditional.

Sheldon had used it once before, on his second night, but in that exhausted haze he'd barely registered the details. Now, waiting his turn while Katsuhito bathed Tenchi, he had time to observe the space properly.

The bathroom was separated from the changing area by a sliding door. The changing area held baskets for clothing, a low shelf with folded towels, a mirror that had seen better decades. Everything was clean but worn, surfaces polished by years of use.

He could hear water splashing on the other side of the door, and Tenchi's voice, high and bright, telling some story about the chickens and what they'd done that morning. Katsuhito's responses were low murmurs, their words indistinct but their tone patient. Grandfather and grandson, sharing a ritual that was older than either of them.

*Father to bathe with young children*, some part of Sheldon's mind supplied. He didn't know where that knowledge came from—cultural osmosis, perhaps, from his semester abroad thirty years ago. Or from something else entirely, something he couldn't name.

The splashing stopped. Voices moved, and then the door slid open.

Tenchi emerged wrapped in a towel that was slightly too large for him, his hair wet and sticking up in several directions at once. His cheeks were flushed from the heat, his eyes bright with that particular alertness that came just before the crash of exhaustion.

"Sheldon-san! I'm clean now!"

"I can see that." Sheldon crouched to meet his eyes. "You look like a very clean lobster."

Tenchi giggled, then tried to look offended, then gave up and giggled again. "Lobsters are red. I'm pink."

"A very clean pink lobster, then."

"Grandfather says I have to go to bed soon." The brightness in Tenchi's eyes flickered with something like disappointment. "But I wanted to say goodnight."

"Then say goodnight."

Tenchi considered this with the gravity of a child making a Very Important Decision. Then he stepped forward and wrapped his small arms around Sheldon's neck, pressing his damp face against Sheldon's shoulder.

"Goodnight, Sheldon-san."

The embrace was brief—children's hugs always were, burning hot and quickly released. But Sheldon felt it echo through him long after Tenchi had pulled away, padding off toward his room with Katsuhito following behind.

*Day three*, he thought. *Three days, and this child is hugging me goodnight.*

It should have felt too fast. It should have felt presumptuous, or overwhelming, or strange. Instead it felt like the most natural thing in the world—a small boy reaching for comfort, and a man offering it without condition.


Katsuhito returned a few minutes later, while Sheldon was still standing in the changing area, processing.

"The bath is yours," the old priest said. "Take your time. The water is still hot."

"Thank you."

Sheldon hesitated, then asked the question that had been forming in his mind. "Does he—does Tenchi do that often? The hugging?"

Katsuhito's expression shifted, something moving beneath the surface that Sheldon couldn't read. "He did. Before his mother died. Then he stopped." A pause, weighted with things unsaid. "Tonight was the first time in almost two years."

The words landed like stones in still water.

"I didn't know," Sheldon said quietly.

"How could you?" Katsuhito moved toward the door, then stopped. "He has chosen to trust you, Tsukino-san. That is not a small thing. Please do not make him regret it."

It wasn't a threat. It was a request—perhaps even a plea, wrapped in the careful dignity of an old man who had already lost too much.

"I won't," Sheldon said.

Katsuhito nodded once, and then he was gone.


The bath was scalding.

Sheldon washed first, as was proper—sitting on the low wooden stool, using the small basin to pour water over himself, scrubbing with soap that smelled of hinoki cypress. The ritual was both foreign and familiar, his hands knowing the movements even as his mind registered their strangeness.

Then the tub itself. Deep enough to sit with water to his shoulders, hot enough to make his skin flush and his muscles unknot. He lowered himself in slowly, breath catching at the temperature, then settling as his body adjusted.

The heat seeped into him, finding the places where tension had gathered—his shoulders, his lower back, the subtle ache in his hands from a day of work. He closed his eyes and let himself float in the sensation.

*Day three.*

The thought kept circling back, a refrain he couldn't escape. Three days ago he had woken in a field with cherry blossoms in his hair and no memory of how he'd arrived. Three days ago he had been a stranger, lost and confused, carrying identification that said he was someone he didn't remember being.

Now he was here. In a bath. In a shrine. In a life that was beginning to take shape around him.

He had made dinner tonight. He had made onigiri that a child compared to his dead grandmother's. He had found himself wielding a knife with skills he'd never learned, cooking fish with techniques that emerged from nowhere.

*Something is happening to me.*

The thought was less frightening than it had been that afternoon. The hot water softened everything, including fear. Whatever was changing in him—whatever had been given or awakened or unlocked—it had let him feed a family tonight. It had let him contribute. It had let him belong.

*Maybe that's enough*, he thought. *Maybe understanding can wait. Maybe the doing is what matters.*

He stayed in the bath until the water began to cool, then dried himself with a towel that was soft from many washings and returned to the changing area. His new clothes were waiting—the grey shirt he'd bought that morning, fresh undergarments, the comfort of fabric that was his own.


The guest room was quiet when he returned to it.

He could hear the shrine settling around him—the small creaks and sighs of an old building adjusting to the night, the distant sound of wind in trees, the absolute silence of a mountain without traffic or crowds. The futon had been laid out for him, probably by Katsuhito while he bathed.

He sat on the edge of the futon, not yet ready to sleep.

The day played back through his mind in fragments. Waking before dawn. The tamagoyaki lesson, his first imperfect attempts. The walk to the village, Tenchi's running commentary on frog rocks and owl trees. Mori-san's torrent of words, Tanaka's quiet efficiency. The garden, the weeding, Tenchi saving the shiso from accidental murder.

And then: the onigiri. The strange certainty of his hands. The dinner that emerged from ingredients he'd never cooked, techniques he'd never learned.

*You listen well, Tsukino-san.*

Katsuhito's words returned to him, and with them the memory of his wife's philosophy. *Cooking was listening. Listening to the ingredients, to the heat, to the moment.*

Maybe that was what was happening. Maybe whatever had been done to him—whatever had restored his body, given him new documents, placed him in this life—had also made him better at listening. To ingredients. To children. To himself.

Or maybe he was looking for patterns in chaos, the scientist's reflex to explain even the inexplicable.

He lay back on the futon, staring at the ceiling beams that had become familiar over three nights. Tomorrow he would make curry, as he'd promised. Tomorrow the skills would either come or they wouldn't, and he would learn something either way.

But tonight—tonight he had fed a family. He had made a child laugh. He had received a hug that apparently hadn't been given in two years.

*Something is taking root*, he thought, and this time the words felt less like observation and more like prayer.

Sleep came slowly, and when it came, it was deep and dreamless and warm.

#### Scene 4.A: Fourth Morning

Sheldon woke before dawn again.

It was becoming a pattern, this early rising—his body attuned to rhythms he didn't remember learning, surfacing from sleep with the first grey light as if responding to some internal signal. Four days now, and each morning had found him awake before the sun cleared the mountains.

He lay still for a moment, cataloguing sensations. The futon beneath him, firm and familiar. The cool air of early morning on his face. The distant sound of birdsong, thin and clear in the pre-dawn quiet.

No pain. No stiffness. No lingering ache from yesterday's garden work.

*Four days*, he thought. *Four days since I woke up in a field with cherry blossoms in my hair.*

The thought felt different this morning. Less urgent. Less frightening. He'd slept deeply, dreaming of nothing he could remember, and woken to a body that felt more his own than it had the day before. Whatever was happening to him—whatever had been given or awakened or restored—it seemed to be settling in. Taking root.

*Something is taking root.*

The phrase returned to him, and he let it sit there without examination. He was learning, slowly, to let things be without needing to understand them.


The kitchen was empty when he entered, dawn light just beginning to color the windows.

Katsuhito was not yet awake, or at least not yet emerged from his quarters. The shrine held that particular silence of early morning—deep and complete, broken only by the creak of old wood and the occasional rustle of wind in trees.

Sheldon moved through the space quietly, orienting himself. The rice cooker. The stove. The cutting board, worn smooth by years of use. The knife block with its array of blades, each designed for a specific purpose.

Today he would make curry.

The thought sat in his mind like a small, warm coal. He'd promised Tenchi. He'd promised Katsuhito too, in a way—agreed to cook again, accepted the role that was forming around him. Now he had to deliver.

*Can I actually do this?*

Yesterday's dinner had emerged from somewhere he couldn't name, techniques surfacing without conscious thought. But curry was different. Curry was complex—spices and timing and the slow building of flavor. He'd eaten Japanese curry before, in Chicago and Atlanta and once at a conference in San Francisco, but he'd never made it.

His hands didn't tingle with anticipation this time. They felt ordinary. Human. Perhaps yesterday had been an anomaly. Perhaps today the strange competence would desert him, and he'd be left fumbling through a recipe he didn't know.

Only one way to find out.


He started with inventory.

The pantry yielded its secrets slowly. Rice, of course—multiple varieties, more than enough for several days. Vegetables: potatoes, carrots, onions. These were the standards, the foundation. He'd seen curry made with these. He knew they belonged.

In a cabinet above the stove, he found what he was looking for.

The box was yellow and orange, decorated with text he couldn't fully read but recognized nonetheless. *House Vermont Curry*, the English letters proclaimed beneath the Japanese characters. Medium-Hot. The picture showed a plate of rice covered in rich brown sauce, steam rising in appetizing curls.

Curry roux. Pre-made, packaged, designed for exactly this purpose.

He turned the box over, examining the instructions. Pictures showed the process: sauté vegetables, add water, simmer, add roux blocks. Simple. Foolproof. The kind of thing anyone could do.

But something in him resisted.

*That's not cooking*, a voice said—not quite his own, or not quite the voice he remembered being his. *That's assembly. That's following instructions. That's not listening.*

He set the box aside and began to look deeper.


The spice cabinet was smaller than he expected, tucked in a corner near the stove. Most Japanese cooking, he was coming to understand, relied on a different palette than Western cuisine—soy and mirin and dashi rather than cumin and coriander.

But curry had been imported. Curry had been adapted. And somewhere in this kitchen, someone had gathered what was needed.

He found it on the top shelf: a small tin, dented and worn, with faded text. *S&B Curry Powder*. When he opened it, the scent hit him like a wave—earthy, warm, complex. Turmeric and cumin and fenugreek and things he couldn't name, blended into something that smelled like memory.

His hands began to move.

Butter from the cold storage. Flour from the pantry. He set them on the counter alongside the curry powder and stared at them, waiting for the knowledge to come.

It came.

*Roux*, the voice said. *You make a roux. Butter and flour, cooked until brown. Then the spices. Then the liquid. You build it layer by layer, listening to each stage before moving to the next.*

He didn't know how he knew this. He'd never made roux from scratch, never combined these particular ingredients in these particular proportions. But his hands were already reaching for a pan, already measuring butter by eye, already heating the element beneath.

The butter melted, foaming gently. He added flour, stirring with a wooden spoon that felt natural in his grip. The mixture thickened, turned paste-like, began to brown as he continued to stir.

*Patience*, the voice reminded him. *Don't rush. Let it develop. Let it tell you when it's ready.*

The kitchen filled with the scent of toasting flour, nutty and warm. He stirred, watching the color deepen from pale gold to amber to something approaching mahogany. His arm should have been tiring—the constant motion, the careful attention—but it felt effortless. Automatic. Right.

When the roux reached the color he somehow knew it needed to be, he added the curry powder. The spices bloomed in the hot fat, releasing aromas that layered over each other in waves: the earthiness of turmeric, the warmth of cumin, something floral he couldn't identify. He stirred, incorporating, letting the flavors marry.

Then he removed the pan from heat and poured the mixture into a shallow dish to cool and set.

Homemade curry roux. Done in twenty minutes. Without a recipe.

*What am I becoming?*


Katsuhito found him an hour later, standing at the stove with vegetables simmering in a pot.

The old priest stopped in the doorway, much as he had the evening before, and surveyed the scene. Onions browning in a pan. Potatoes and carrots cut into precise chunks, waiting their turn. The homemade roux sitting in its dish, firm now and fragrant. Chicken pieces—found in the cold storage, wrapped in paper—marinating in something Sheldon had improvised from soy sauce and ginger.

"You are making curry," Katsuhito said.

"I promised Tenchi."

"So you did." The old priest moved into the kitchen, examining the roux with an expression Sheldon couldn't read. "You made this yourself."

It wasn't a question. Sheldon nodded anyway.

"My wife used to make roux from scratch." Katsuhito's voice was quiet, almost distant. "She said the packaged kind was convenient, but soulless. She said cooking was about putting yourself into the food."

"She sounds like a wise woman."

"She was." Katsuhito looked up from the roux, meeting Sheldon's eyes. "Where did you learn this, Tsukino-san?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implications neither of them spoke aloud.

"I don't know," Sheldon admitted. "I've never made curry before. I've never made roux. I just..." He searched for words that wouldn't sound insane. "I just knew what to do. My hands knew."

Katsuhito was silent for a long moment. Then he nodded, slowly, as if confirming something to himself.

"There are many kinds of knowledge," he said. "Not all of them come from books or teachers. Some are older. Some are given." He moved toward the door, then paused. "Tenchi will be awake soon. He will want to know about the curry."

"It will be ready by dinner."

"I have no doubt." The old priest's eyes held something that might have been wonder, or might have been wariness. "No doubt at all."


Tenchi arrived in the kitchen like a small hurricane, still rubbing sleep from his eyes but already asking questions.

"Is it curry? Are you making curry? Grandfather said you were making curry!"

"I'm making curry," Sheldon confirmed. "But it won't be ready until dinner. Curry needs time."

"Why does it need time?"

"Because the flavors need to get to know each other." Sheldon found himself crouching to meet the boy's eyes. "Like people. When you first meet someone, you don't know everything about them. You have to spend time together, learn how you fit. Curry is the same. The vegetables and the spices and the sauce all need time to understand each other."

Tenchi considered this with his characteristic gravity. "So the curry is making friends?"

"Something like that."

"Okay." He seemed satisfied by this explanation. "Can I help?"

Sheldon looked at the kitchen—the pot simmering on the stove, the chicken waiting to be added, the roux that would need to be incorporated later. There were things Tenchi could do. Things that would make him feel included, part of the process.

"Can you wash the rice?" he asked. "For tonight's dinner. Four cups, in the rice cooker bowl."

Tenchi's face lit up. "I can do that! Grandmother taught me!"

He scrambled to the counter, dragging a step stool with him, and began the process with more enthusiasm than precision. Water splashed. Rice grains escaped. But he was careful, determined, focused on the task with the intensity only children could bring to something they considered important.

Sheldon watched him and felt that warm thing in his chest again—the one that had been growing since he'd arrived. The one that felt like roots spreading, like foundations being laid, like something permanent being built from temporary moments.

*Four days*, he thought. *Four days, and I'm teaching a child to wash rice while curry simmers on the stove.*

The sun had risen fully now, filling the kitchen with morning light. Through the window, he could see the shrine grounds, the great tree standing patient in its courtyard, the steps leading down toward the village he was beginning to know.

He turned back to the curry and continued to cook.

#### Scene 4.B: The Tsukino House

"You should see it."

Katsuhito's voice was matter-of-fact as they finished breakfast—leftover rice, miso soup, the simple fare of a household between elaborate meals. The curry simmered on the stove, filling the kitchen with promises for dinner. Tenchi had been dispatched to feed the chickens, his protests fading into the morning air.

"The house?" Sheldon set down his chopsticks. "I was thinking the same thing."

"It's yours, according to your documents." The old priest's eyes were steady. "You should know what you've inherited."

*What I've inherited.* The words sat strangely in his mind. He'd inherited nothing—he'd been given a life, a history, documents that claimed he belonged to people he'd never met. But the house was real. The house existed regardless of how his connection to it had been created.

"Do you know where it is?"

"Down the mountain. Three hundred meters, perhaps less." Katsuhito gestured vaguely toward the east. "Past the second torii, down the stone path that forks left. You'll see it from the road—the dark house with the overgrown garden."

"Has anyone been inside recently?"

"Not in years. Villagers check on it occasionally—make sure the roof hasn't collapsed, no vagrants have moved in. But the family moved to Osaka long ago." A pause. "Your family, I suppose."

The correction hung between them, neither quite accurate and neither quite wrong.


The path down the mountain was different from the one to the village.

Narrower, less traveled, the stones worn smooth in different patterns. Trees pressed closer here, their branches meeting overhead to form a green tunnel that filtered the morning light into shifting coins of gold. Sheldon walked slowly, observing, letting his feet find their own way over the uneven ground.

He passed the second torii—smaller than the first, weathered red fading to pink at the edges—and found the fork Katsuhito had mentioned. Left led downhill toward a cluster of rooftops barely visible through the trees. Right continued along the ridge toward destinations unknown.

Left.

The path opened after fifty meters, trees giving way to a clearing where a house sat in patient silence.

Sheldon stopped.

*The dark house with the overgrown garden.* Katsuhito's description was accurate but insufficient. The house wasn't just dark—it was *quiet*, the kind of quiet that spoke of years without voices, without footsteps, without the small daily sounds that made a dwelling into a home.

It was a minka, a traditional farmhouse, single-story with dark wooden walls and a roof of traditional tiles. The architecture was modest but solid—the work of people who had built for permanence, not show. The engawa wrapped around two visible sides, its boards weathered to silver-grey.

And the garden. Oh, the garden.

What had once been cultivated had become wild. Bushes that might have been ornamental had grown into shapeless masses. Weeds rose knee-high through what Sheldon guessed had been a vegetable plot. A small maple tree—probably decorative, probably carefully pruned for decades—had sent up shoots in all directions, its disciplined shape lost to years of freedom.

But beneath the neglect, he could see the bones of something lovely. Stone paths, barely visible under growth. A small pond, choked with algae but still holding water. The suggestion of beds, borders, intentions.

*A house waiting for someone to return.*

He walked toward the front entrance.


The door was unlocked.

This surprised him until he remembered where he was—rural Japan, 1989, a village where everyone knew everyone and crime was something that happened in cities. The door slid open with a rasp of wood on wood, old and stiff but functional.

The smell hit him first: dust, age, the particular mustiness of enclosed spaces. Not rot—the house was dry, structurally sound—but the accumulated stillness of years without air circulation. He left the door open behind him, letting daylight and fresh breeze begin the process of awakening.

The genkan was small, traditional—a step down from the outside, then a step up to the raised floor. He removed his shoes and placed them neatly beside a rack that held nothing, a ghost of domestic organization.

Beyond the genkan, the main room opened wide and dim.

Dust cloths covered the furniture—white shapes in the darkness, like things sleeping under snow. He could make out the suggestion of a low table, floor cushions, a tansu cabinet against the far wall. The fusuma—sliding paper doors—stood closed, dividing the space into mysteries.

Sheldon moved through the room slowly, pulling back cloths as he went.

The table was old, solid, the kind that had hosted countless meals and would host countless more if given the chance. The wood beneath the dust was good—dark and polished, showing only superficial wear. The cushions had seen better days—fabric faded, stuffing compressed—but they were intact.

The tansu revealed itself as beautiful when uncovered, its wood grain rich even under accumulated grime. The drawers opened smoothly, empty except for the faint scent of cedar.

He opened the fusuma to the first small room.

A bedroom, or what had been one. Futon storage built into the wall, empty now. A low dressing table with a mirror clouded by age. On the wall, a scroll painting—mountains in mist, the brushwork confident and spare.

The second small room was similar in size but different in function. A desk against one wall, Western-style, with a chair tucked beneath. Bookshelves, mostly empty but showing the ghosts of spines in the dust patterns. A single book remained, fallen behind the lowest shelf—he retrieved it and found a Japanese-English dictionary, its pages yellowed but intact.

*Someone studied languages here.*

The kitchen was at the back—smaller than the Masaki shrine's, equipped for a family of two or three. A kamado stove, traditional, cold for years. A sink with taps that, when he tried them, produced nothing but a hollow groan from disconnected pipes. Shelves held dishes—simple ceramics, a few chipped but most sound. Pots and pans hung from hooks, dusty but functional.

Through the kitchen window, he could see the back garden—more overgrowth, what might have been a vegetable patch now consumed by grass and weeds. A shed stood at the property's edge, door hanging askew.

He didn't go outside yet. There was more to see indoors.


The engawa was where the house began to speak.

He slid open the exterior fusuma and stepped onto the veranda, feeling the boards give slightly under his weight. Katsuhito had been right—soft in places, the wood beginning to rot where rain had reached it. But the structure was sound. The joists beneath held firm. This was surface damage, repairable with time and resources.

He walked the length of the engawa, testing each section, cataloguing problems as he went. Three boards needed replacement on the south side. A post had begun to lean at the corner—not dangerous yet, but requiring attention. The roof above showed gaps where tiles had shifted or fallen, letting in water that had done its slow damage.

From the engawa, he could see the garden properly. The morning light was stronger now, revealing details hidden in the dimness of approach. The maple tree was actually quite lovely, its wild growth creating a canopy of shade over what had been a seating area—a stone bench, barely visible, moss-covered and patient. The pond reflected sky through its algae veil.

*This could be beautiful again.*

The thought emerged unbidden, and with it came something else—a sense of possibility, of potential, of work that could be done and results that could be achieved. He didn't know this house. He had no memories of running through these rooms as a child, no images of a mother cooking in that kitchen or a father reading at that desk. The photograph in his wallet showed people he'd never met, and the letter spoke of connections he couldn't feel.

But the house was real. The garden was real. The damage was real, and therefore the repair was possible.

*This could be home.*


He spent two hours making an assessment.

The roof was the most urgent issue. Missing tiles needed replacement, and some of the underlying structure had water damage. He climbed onto a storage chest to peer into the crawl space beneath the eaves and found rot in two support beams—not critical yet, but escalating. Yamada-san's estimate of ¥200,000-250,000 for roofing alone seemed accurate, perhaps optimistic.

The engawa repairs he could do himself, given time and materials. Lumber for replacement boards, some basic tools, the willingness to work. Call it ¥50,000 in materials if he did the labor.

Utilities were a separate consideration. Reconnecting water would require the town office, inspections, fees. Electric the same. He estimated ¥30,000-50,000 for each, plus whatever work the internal systems needed after years of dormancy.

The garden was labor, not money—hours of cutting, clearing, coaxing. He could do that himself, over time.

Interior cleaning the same. Soap and water and elbow grease. The dust would yield to effort.

Furniture was usable. Dishes were usable. The bones were good.

Total immediate needs: ¥300,000-400,000, assuming Yamada handled the roof and he did everything else himself.

He had ¥830,000.

*This is possible.*


He found the photograph album in the tansu's bottom drawer, hidden beneath a layer of rice paper.

He hadn't been looking for it. He'd been checking the drawer mechanism, testing for damage, and his fingers had touched the edge of something that wasn't supposed to be there. He pulled it out and sat on the floor with it in his lap, morning light slanting through the open fusuma.

The album was old, its cover fabric faded from deep blue to something closer to grey. The binding was loose but held. Inside, the pages were thick paper, photographs attached with corner mounts that had yellowed with age.

The first page showed a couple he didn't recognize—a man in traditional clothing, a woman in kimono, both young, both serious-faced in the way of formal photographs. The date written beneath: 1925.

*Grandparents?*

He turned pages. The couple aged gradually, photograph by photograph. A child appeared—a boy, serious like his parents. Then another. The family grew, changed, moved through time preserved in silver and paper.

He found Takeo.

The name was written beneath the photograph in careful characters. Takeo at five, Takeo at twelve, Takeo in his twenties wearing work clothes and something approaching a smile. The resemblance was there—not strong, but present. The shape of the jaw, perhaps. The set of the shoulders.

*My father. According to the documents.*

He felt nothing.

This was what disturbed him most—not the strangeness of finding himself in possession of a dead man's photographs, but the complete absence of connection. He should feel something. Grief, perhaps, for a father he'd never known. Curiosity about the life captured in these images. Recognition of features that might echo in his own face.

Instead, there was only observation. A man lived here. He had a family. They are gone. This remains.

Sheldon closed the album and returned it to its place beneath the rice paper.


He was still sitting on the floor when the knock came.

"Hello?" A woman's voice, uncertain. "Is someone there?"

He rose, brushing dust from his trousers, and went to the genkan. A woman stood outside—middle-aged, neat clothing, the kind of carefully arranged appearance that suggested effort. She had a basket over one arm.

"I'm sorry to intrude." Her eyes widened slightly as she took him in—the foreign features, the height, the unexpected presence in an empty house. "I saw the door open. I thought perhaps..."

"I'm Tsukino Sheldon." He bowed, the gesture becoming more natural with each repetition. "I'm the owner. Or—the family's representative, at least."

"Tsukino?" Her expression shifted through several emotions—surprise, recognition, something that might have been relief. "You're the one Mori-san mentioned. The one staying at the shrine."

News traveled fast in small villages. Sheldon wasn't surprised.

"I came to assess the house," he said. "See what condition it's in."

"It's been empty for years." The woman seemed to relax slightly, accepting his presence if not entirely comfortable with it. "We've tried to keep an eye on it—the neighborhood, I mean. Make sure nothing terrible happens."

"I appreciate that. The house is... it needs work, but it's not beyond saving."

"Will you—" She hesitated, then pushed forward. "Will you be moving in?"

The question hung in the morning air. Sheldon looked past her at the overgrown garden, the patient house, the life waiting to be reclaimed.

"Yes," he said. "I think I will."

#### Scene 4.C: The Afternoon

The neighbor's name was Tanaka Michiko.

She was, it turned out, the wife of Tanaka-san from the general store—the man who had sold Sheldon clothes two days ago with efficient precision and no wasted words. His wife was the opposite: warm, effusive, the kind of person who filled silences before they had a chance to form.

"My husband mentioned you," she said, following Sheldon back through the house as he closed the exterior fusuma and prepared to leave. "Said you bought work clothes. Good quality ones. I told him, 'That's the kind of man who plans to stay.' And here you are!"

"Here I am," Sheldon agreed.

"The house needs work, of course." She peered around him at the dusty interior. "But the bones are good. The Tsukinos built well, back in the day. My mother-in-law remembers when the family was still here—said they were quiet people, kept to themselves, but always helped when there was trouble."

She paused, perhaps realizing she was speaking of his alleged family to him. "I'm sorry. You probably know all this already."

"Actually, I don't." Sheldon slid the door closed behind them, sealing the house back into its patient silence. "I was raised in America. My mother talked about Japan, but not... not in detail. I'm learning as I go."

"Oh." Michiko's expression softened with something like sympathy. "Well. We're glad you've come back, then. Houses shouldn't sit empty. They get sad."

*Houses get sad.* It was a strange way to put it, anthropomorphizing a structure of wood and tile. But standing here, looking at the overgrown garden and the weathered walls, Sheldon thought he understood what she meant. The house *did* feel sad—not ruined, not abandoned, but waiting. Hoping. Ready to welcome whoever would give it life again.

"I'll be back," he told the house as much as Michiko. "Soon."


The walk back to the shrine felt shorter than the walk down.

Perhaps it was the slope—uphill now instead of down—or perhaps it was the lightness in his chest, the sense of purpose that came with having made a decision. He would move into the Tsukino house. He would repair it, clean it, restore it to something worthy of being called home. He had the money. He had the time. And apparently, he had skills he hadn't known he possessed.

The second torii appeared through the trees, and then the main grounds of the shrine opened before him—the courtyard, the buildings, the great tree standing patient in its place.

His eyes found the tree again.

*Beautiful*, he thought. *Old. Patient.* The same words that came to him every time he looked at it, as if no others were adequate. He didn't know why this particular tree drew his attention so consistently. There were other trees on the grounds, other ancient things worthy of admiration. But this one called to him in a way he couldn't name.

He walked past it without stopping. There would be time for contemplation later. Right now, there was curry to check on and a child who was probably wondering where he'd gone.


Tenchi found him before he reached the kitchen.

The boy came barreling around the corner of the main building, momentum carrying him several steps past Sheldon before he could stop and reverse course. "You're back! Grandfather said you went to the old house. Was it scary? Was there ghosts? Was it really old?"

"Very old," Sheldon confirmed. "But no ghosts. Just dust."

"I don't like dust." Tenchi wrinkled his nose. "It makes me sneeze."

"It makes everyone sneeze. That's what dust does."

"Why?"

"Because—" Sheldon paused, caught off guard by the simplicity of the question and the complexity of its answer. Because dust particles irritate the nasal passages, triggering a reflexive expulsion of air designed to clear the respiratory system of foreign material. That was the scientific answer, the one his physicist's mind supplied automatically.

But Tenchi was four, almost five. He didn't need cellular biology.

"Because your nose doesn't like things that don't belong there," Sheldon said instead. "It sneezes to push them out. Like when you blow a dandelion—" He mimed the action. "Your nose does that with dust."

"Oh." Tenchi considered this. "My nose is very smart."

"It is. All noses are."

"Even Grandfather's nose?"

"Especially Grandfather's nose. His nose has been sneezing for a very long time. It's had lots of practice."

Tenchi giggled at the image of his grandfather's nose practicing anything, and Sheldon felt that warm thing in his chest again—the one that seemed to grow every time he made this child laugh.


The curry had reduced beautifully in his absence.

He checked the pot, lifting the lid to release steam fragrant with spices and long-simmered vegetables. The homemade roux had dissolved completely, thickening the liquid into something rich and complex. The chicken, added mid-morning, had cooked through and begun to fall apart at the edges.

It needed rice. It needed bowls and spoons and hungry people to appreciate it. But first, it needed a few more hours—time for the flavors to deepen, for the sauce to concentrate, for everything to become more than the sum of its parts.

*Just like curry at home*, he thought, and then stopped.

Home. He'd thought of this kitchen—this shrine—as a point of reference for "home." Not the Tsukino house he'd just claimed, not the apartment in Atlanta he'd lived in for decades, not any of the other places he'd passed through in his life. This kitchen, here, where he'd been a guest for four days.

Was that strange? Was that too fast?

He decided it didn't matter. The feeling was what it was. He would let it be without needing to understand it.


The afternoon passed in small tasks.

He helped Katsuhito repair a section of fence that had come loose over the winter, holding boards in place while the old priest hammered with sure, economical strokes. The work was physical but not demanding—the kind of labor that let the mind wander while the hands stayed busy.

"I visited the house," Sheldon said during a pause between boards. "The Tsukino house."

"I assumed you would." Katsuhito selected another nail from the can at his feet. "What did you think?"

"It needs work. The roof especially. But it's... salvageable."

"Salvageable." The priest positioned the nail, tapped it once to set, then drove it home with three clean strikes. "That's an interesting word for an inheritance."

"It's an accurate word. The house has been empty for years. It's not in condition to live in without repairs."

"And you intend to make those repairs?"

"Yes."

Katsuhito set down the hammer and looked at Sheldon directly—the first time in the conversation he'd done so. "You've been here four days, Tsukino-san. In that time, you've cooked for my family, worked in my garden, walked to the village, and now you're planning to restore a house. Most people who find themselves in an unfamiliar place would still be... adjusting."

"I'm not most people."

"No." The old priest's eyes were unreadable. "You are not."

He picked up the hammer again and returned to work without further comment. Sheldon held the next board and wondered what exactly Katsuhito saw when he looked at him—what conclusions he was drawing, what questions he was choosing not to ask.


Tenchi helped set the table for dinner.

He carried bowls to the low table with exaggerated care, placing each one precisely where Katsuhito indicated it should go. Sheldon watched from the kitchen doorway, curry ladle in hand, and marveled at the boy's determination. Each bowl was a mission. Each placement was an achievement.

"Is the curry ready?" Tenchi asked for the sixth time in an hour.

"It's ready."

"Is it *really* ready?"

"Would I lie to you?"

Tenchi considered this. "No," he decided. "You don't lie. Your face is too honest."

Sheldon wasn't sure whether to be flattered or concerned by this assessment of his transparency. He settled for ladling curry into bowls while Katsuhito served rice, and soon the table was complete—three places, three bowls of curry, three portions of rice, steam rising in the evening light.

The first bite told him everything he needed to know.

The curry was *right*. Not just edible, not just acceptable—right. The homemade roux had given it depth that the packaged kind could never achieve. The long simmer had married the flavors into something greater than their individual parts. The spices sang in harmony rather than competing for attention.

He hadn't made curry before. He'd never learned, never practiced, never even watched someone else do it. And yet here it was: a dish worthy of praise, emerging from hands that moved with knowledge they hadn't earned.

Tenchi was already on his second helping.

"This is *good*," the boy announced between bites. "This is the best curry ever."

"You've had curry before?" Sheldon asked.

"Father makes it sometimes. From the box." Tenchi wrinkled his nose. "It's okay. But this is *better*."

Katsuhito ate in silence, as was his way. But his bowl was emptying steadily, and when he finished, he placed his chopsticks across the rim with the particular care of someone acknowledging quality.

"You said you hadn't made curry before," he said.

"I hadn't."

"And yet."

"And yet."

They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of unexplained competence hanging between them. Then Katsuhito rose to begin clearing dishes, and the moment passed.


After dinner, Sheldon found himself on the engawa again.

The evening had settled into that particular quality of stillness that came between the activity of day and the rest of night. Somewhere inside, Katsuhito was putting Tenchi to bed—the sound of small protests and patient responses drifting through the walls.

The great tree stood before him in the darkness, its shape barely visible against the stars. He couldn't see it clearly, but he could feel it somehow—a presence, patient and ancient, watching over the shrine as it had for centuries.

*I'm going to move into the house*, he thought. *I'm going to leave this place.*

The thought brought unexpected sadness. Four days, and he'd begun to feel like he belonged here. Four days, and the shrine had become something like home.

But the Tsukino house was his. By right of documents, by decision of will. He would restore it. He would live in it. He would make it into a home.

And the shrine would still be here. Three hundred meters up the mountain, a path through the trees, the second torii marking the boundary between worlds. He would visit. He would continue to cook, perhaps, if Katsuhito would allow it. He would watch Tenchi grow.

*This isn't an ending*, he told himself. *It's a beginning.*

The tree seemed to agree, though he couldn't have said how he knew.

#### Scene 4.D: Evening

"Grandfather says I have to go to bed."

"Then you should go to bed."

"But I'm not tired." The protest was undercut by a yawn that seemed to consume his entire face. "I wanted to ask you something."

Sheldon shifted on the engawa, making room beside him. The boy settled into the space with the boneless ease of children, his shoulder pressing against Sheldon's arm.

"What did you want to ask?"

"Are you going to leave?"

The question landed in the quiet like a stone in water. Sheldon looked down at Tenchi's face—upturned, serious, the expression of a child who had learned too young that people could leave and not come back.

"I'm going to move into a house nearby," he said carefully. "The old Tsukino house, down the mountain. But it's not far. I'll still visit."

"How far?"

"Three hundred meters. Maybe a little less."

Tenchi considered this, his brow furrowed with the effort of conceptualization. "Is that far?"

"It's about as far as the walk to the village torii. You could run there in two or three minutes."

"Oh." The furrow smoothed slightly. "That's not very far."

"No. It's not."

They sat in silence for a moment, watching the darkness deepen over the courtyard. The great tree was a shape against the stars now, its branches barely visible.

"Will you still make curry?"

"If Grandfather lets me use the kitchen."

"He will. He likes your cooking." Tenchi yawned again. "I like your cooking too."

"I'm glad."

"And I like you." The words came out matter-of-fact, the simple declaration of a child who had not yet learned to guard his heart. "I hope you stay forever."

Sheldon's chest tightened around something warm and sharp. "I can't promise forever. But I can promise I'll be here tomorrow. And the day after that. And the day after that. As far ahead as I can see."

Tenchi seemed to find this acceptable. He leaned more heavily against Sheldon's arm, his eyes beginning to drift closed despite his earlier protests.

"Okay," he murmured. "That's okay."


Katsuhito appeared a few minutes later to collect his grandson.

He didn't comment on finding them together on the engawa, Tenchi half-asleep against Sheldon's side. He simply lifted the boy with the ease of long practice and nodded once toward Sheldon.

"The kitchen is yours, if you wish to wash the dishes."

"I was planning to."

"I thought you might." The old priest paused at the door. "Tenchi asked you about leaving."

"He did."

"And your answer?"

"That I would be nearby. That I would visit. That I can't promise forever, but I can promise tomorrow."

Something shifted in Katsuhito's expression—not quite a smile, but something warmer than his usual reserve. "That is a wise answer. Children need honesty more than comfort. Comfort built on lies breaks when they need it most."

He disappeared into the house with Tenchi, and Sheldon was left alone on the engawa with the weight of that approval settling over him like a blanket.


The dishes were a familiar ritual now.

He stood at the sink with hot water and soap, scrubbing the remnants of curry from bowls and pot, watching the brown sauce swirl down the drain. The kitchen was quiet except for the sounds of his work—water running, ceramic clinking, the soft scrape of the brush against metal.

Five days ago, he hadn't existed.

The thought came unbidden, startling in its clarity. Five days ago—or rather, five days before his awakening in the field—there had been no Tsukino Sheldon. No man with this face, this body, this collection of documents claiming identity. He had been... elsewhere. Someone else. A physicist dying in a laboratory accident, the last thing he'd known the flash of white light and the certainty that everything was ending.

And then: cherry blossoms. A field. A wallet full of someone else's life.

*Except it's my life now*, he thought, setting a clean bowl in the drying rack. *However it happened. Whoever arranged it. This is who I am.*

The acceptance felt deeper tonight than it had before. Not resignation—he wasn't surrendering to circumstance—but integration. The man he'd been and the man he was becoming were beginning to merge, their edges blurring into something new.

He dried his hands and went to draw the bath.


The hot water embraced him like forgiveness.

He sat in the ofuro with water to his shoulders, steam rising around him, muscles unknotting in the heat. The day's labor released its hold—the fence repair, the walk up and down the mountain, the tension of standing in a house that belonged to strangers who shared his name.

*Not strangers*, he corrected himself. *Family.*

But they were strangers. The photograph album had proved that. He'd looked at Takeo's face and felt nothing—no recognition, no grief, no sense of connection. The documents said these people were his parents, his grandmother, his uncle. The documents were, in their way, accurate. But documents couldn't create feeling.

*Neither can absence*, he thought. *You can't miss what you never had.*

He'd never had parents, in this life. Never had a childhood spent in that house, learning to love those faces. His history had been created whole, inserted into reality like a key into a lock, functional but not earned.

The Masaki family was different.

He'd earned nothing there either—hadn't known them before four days ago, hadn't built relationship through years of shared experience. But something was growing nonetheless. Tenchi's hugs, Katsuhito's measured trust, the way the shrine was beginning to feel like somewhere he belonged. These connections were being built in real time, moment by moment, choice by choice.

*Maybe that's what matters*, he thought. *Not how you came to be somewhere, but what you do once you're there.*

The water had cooled slightly. He stayed a few minutes longer, letting the heat finish its work, then rose and dried himself and went to prepare for sleep.


The guest room waited for him, futon already laid out.

Katsuhito had done it again—prepared the sleeping space while Sheldon bathed, a small kindness offered without comment or expectation of thanks. The blanket was turned down. The pillow was positioned precisely. Everything was exactly as it should be.

Sheldon lay down and stared at the ceiling beams that had become familiar over four nights.

*Tomorrow*, he thought. *Tomorrow I'll talk to Yamada-san about the roof. Tomorrow I'll start making plans, creating timelines, turning the decision into reality.*

But tonight—tonight he could rest.

The sounds of the shrine wrapped around him: the distant murmur of wind in trees, the creak of old wood settling, the absolute quiet of a mountain without cities. Somewhere in the house, Katsuhito was doing whatever old priests did in the evening hours—reading, perhaps, or meditating, or simply being.

Somewhere closer, Tenchi was sleeping the deep sleep of childhood, dreaming whatever children dream.

And here, in this room that was beginning to feel like his, Sheldon let himself drift toward unconsciousness.

*Four days*, was his last coherent thought. *Four days, and I've found a family. Found a purpose. Found something worth building toward.*

The sleep that took him was deep and warm and full of nothing at all.

#### Scene 5.A: Fifth Morning

The fifth morning arrived with rain.

Sheldon woke to the sound of it against the roof—a gentle drumming that had become background noise at some point in the night, easing him through dreams he couldn't remember. He lay in the futon for a moment, listening, cataloguing the differences this weather brought to the shrine's usual soundscape.

The birds were quieter. The wood creaked in different places, swelling with moisture. Somewhere in the house, he could hear the faint drip of water—not inside, but close, perhaps from an eave that channeled rain in a particular pattern.

*Good day for roofing arrangements*, he thought, and almost laughed at the irony.

He rose, dressed, and went to begin the morning.


Breakfast was simple: leftover rice, pickled vegetables, miso soup that Katsuhito had somehow assembled while Sheldon was still waking. The old priest moved through the kitchen with the efficiency of long practice, each motion purposeful, nothing wasted.

"I'm going to find Yamada-san today," Sheldon said over his bowl. "About the roof."

Katsuhito nodded. "He lives on the east side of the village. Past Ito-san's store, left at the shrine, third house with the blue tiles." A pause. "He doesn't work in rain. You'll find him home."

"Should I bring anything? As introduction?"

"Your business will be introduction enough. Yamada-san cares about work, not ceremony." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "He is a man of few words and many opinions. Don't be offended if he tests you before accepting the job."

"Tests me how?"

"He'll want to see the house himself. He'll want to know you understand what needs doing, and why. He doesn't work for people who don't respect the craft."

Sheldon absorbed this. It reminded him, distantly, of advisors he'd worked with in his previous life—academics who cared more about intellectual rigor than social niceties, who tested students with questions before committing to mentor them.

"I'll try not to disappoint him."

"I don't think you will." Katsuhito's eyes held that measuring quality Sheldon had come to recognize. "You understand work. He'll see that."


The rain had softened to a mist by the time he descended the mountain.

Sheldon took his time on the steps, each one slick with water that made the stone gleam like polished glass. The forest pressed close on either side, greener than it had been yesterday, drinking in the moisture with visible enthusiasm. Droplets hung from every leaf, trembling in the faint breeze before falling to join their fellows on the ground below.

Three hundred twenty steps. He'd counted them his first day, exhausted and uncertain, and now they felt almost routine—a transition between worlds rather than an obstacle to be overcome.

The village appeared through the mist as a collection of shapes: rooftops first, then walls, then the familiar layout of the main street. Few people were about in this weather—an elderly woman with an umbrella, hurrying toward the general store; a cat watching the rain from beneath a wagon; the distant sound of someone hammering, muffled by moisture.

Sheldon found Ito-san's store first, its windows glowing with warm light against the grey morning. He nodded to the old man through the glass and received a wave in return—Haruki's wife must have mentioned the encounter yesterday, because the gesture carried the ease of established acquaintance rather than cautious curiosity.

Left at the shrine. A small one, not like the Masaki grounds, just a weathered torii and a stone marker and a collection box that probably saw more visitors during festivals than ordinary days. Third house with the blue tiles.

The house was modest, well-maintained, with a workshop attached to the side that was larger than the living quarters. The roof tiles were indeed blue—distinctive, probably custom work, the kind of thing a roofer might do to advertise his skill.

Sheldon knocked on the workshop door.


Yamada Kenji was sixty-three years old, built like a barrel, and had eyes that seemed to take measurements of everything they saw.

"Tsukino, is it." Not a question. Word traveled fast in small villages. "Katsuhito-sensei's guest. The one with the old house."

"Yes."

"Come in, then. Close the door—the damp is bad for the tools."

The workshop was a revelation: organized chaos that was actually precise order, every tool hanging in its designated place, every material sorted by type and size. Stacks of tiles lined one wall—traditional clay, various colors, some clearly salvaged and restored. Wood samples occupied another section. A workbench dominated the center of the space, currently hosting what looked like a half-completed repair on a wooden beam.

"Sit." Yamada gestured to a stool near the workbench. "Tea?"

"Please."

The roofer moved to a small kettle in the corner, his movements economical but not rushed. He poured two cups, handed one to Sheldon, and settled onto his own stool with the air of a man preparing for serious conversation.

"The Tsukino house," he said. "I've seen it. Drove by six months ago, noticed the tiles." He took a sip of tea. "You want me to fix the roof."

"I want you to assess it first. Tell me what needs to be done and what it will cost. Then I'll decide."

Something shifted in Yamada's expression—not quite approval, but perhaps the absence of disapproval. "You've looked at it yourself."

"Yesterday. I counted missing tiles, checked for water damage, looked at the support beams in the crawl space." Sheldon listed his findings methodically: the gaps in the tile coverage, the rot in two support beams, the evidence of water intrusion along the south-facing eave. "I estimated between two hundred and two hundred fifty thousand yen for materials and labor, but I wanted a professional opinion."

Yamada listened without interruption. When Sheldon finished, he set down his cup and studied his guest with those measuring eyes.

"You're not a builder."

"No."

"But you know how to look at a building."

"I know how to observe. How to identify patterns. How to recognize when something isn't working the way it should."

"What did you do? Before you came here?"

The question could have been intrusive. From Yamada, it felt like professional curiosity—one craftsman asking another about their trade.

"I was a scientist. A physicist. I studied theoretical models of how the universe works." Sheldon paused, considering how to translate this for a man who built things with his hands. "I looked at problems and tried to understand their underlying structure. What caused them. How they connected to other problems."

"Hmm." Yamada rose from his stool and went to a cabinet, retrieving a rolled paper that he spread across the workbench. It was a diagram—cross-section of a traditional roof, every beam and joint labeled in careful handwriting.

"This is how a roof works," he said. "The tiles keep out water. The underlayment guides water that gets through. The beams carry weight. The joists distribute load. Every piece depends on every other piece." He traced connections with a calloused finger. "You can replace a tile here, shore up a beam there. But if you don't understand how they fit together, you fix one problem and create three more."

"Like a system," Sheldon said. "Change one variable and the effects propagate."

"Yes." Yamada met his eyes. "Exactly like that."

They spent the next hour discussing the house. Yamada asked questions—specific, technical, probing—and listened to the answers with the attention of someone who was genuinely interested rather than simply being polite. By the end, Sheldon had learned more about traditional Japanese roofing than he'd ever expected to know, and Yamada had formed whatever opinion he needed to form.

"I'll come look at the house tomorrow," the roofer said finally. "If the rain clears. We'll walk the roof together, and I'll give you a real estimate."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet." Yamada's mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but something close. "I haven't agreed to do the work. I've agreed to look. Looking is free."

"Fair enough."

"You can find your own way out." The roofer turned back to his workbench, picking up a tool that looked like a specialized chisel. "Tell Katsuhito-sensei his roof beam is ready when he wants it."


The rain had stopped entirely by the time Sheldon emerged from the workshop.

The sky remained grey, but lighter now—the kind of overcast that might break into sun by afternoon or might persist through evening, undecided about its intentions. Water still dripped from eaves and pooled in the shallow places of the road, but the steady fall had ceased.

Sheldon walked through the village slowly, taking in details he'd missed on previous visits. A bakery he hadn't noticed before, its window displaying bread in shapes he didn't recognize. A small hardware store, doors open to let in the fresh post-rain air. Children in school uniforms, emerging from houses with umbrellas they wouldn't need, heading toward wherever children went on Friday mornings.

*This is my village now*, he thought. *Or it will be.*

The thought felt strange but not unwelcome. He was building something here—not just a house, but a life. Connections and competencies and the slow accumulation of belonging that came from showing up, day after day, and doing the work.

He stopped at Ito-san's store on the way back, buying eggs and green onions and a small bottle of vinegar he thought might be useful. Haruki chatted at him enthusiastically while Fumiko observed from behind the counter, her sharp eyes taking note of his purchases and probably drawing conclusions about what he intended to cook.

"You're settling in well," Haruki said as he made change. "Mori-san says you've been helping at the shrine. Yamada-san will be glad to have the work—he's been complaining about being bored."

"He didn't seem bored to me."

"Ha! Yamada-san always seems busy. But he likes a real project. The Tsukino house—that's a real project." Haruki handed over the bag. "Good luck with it."

"Thank you."

The walk back up the mountain was long but pleasant, the air washed clean by rain, the forest gleaming with moisture and the particular green that came after storms. Sheldon carried his purchases and his thoughts and the quiet satisfaction of a morning well spent.

Tomorrow, Yamada would look at the roof.

Tomorrow, the work would begin in earnest.

But today—today was for cooking, and contemplation, and the small rituals of belonging that were becoming, slowly but surely, his own.

#### Scene 5.B: The Afternoon

The shrine was quiet when Sheldon returned, the particular silence of a place whose inhabitants had departed on their own errands.

Katsuhito had left a note on the kitchen table: *Gone to town. Back before dinner. Rice in cooker.* The handwriting was neat, each character precisely formed, the kind of penmanship that came from decades of practice.

Sheldon set down his purchases and stood for a moment in the empty kitchen, listening to the house settle around him. Outside, the post-rain world dripped and sparkled, sunlight beginning to break through the clouds and set everything gleaming.

He had several hours to himself. Tenchi wouldn't return from kindergarten until mid-afternoon. Katsuhito was in town. The shrine waited, patient as always, for whatever he chose to do with the time.

*Cook*, the voice suggested—the one that wasn't quite his own, or wasn't quite the voice he remembered. *You have ingredients. You have time. Cook.*

He looked at the eggs, the green onions, the vinegar. Something was forming in his mind—not a plan exactly, but a shape. A possibility.

His hands began to move.


Tamagoyaki again, but different this time.

The basic technique had come to him on Day 3, imperfect at first, then improving with each attempt. Now he wanted to try a variation—something that used the vinegar, that incorporated the green onions, that pushed beyond the familiar into new territory.

*Pickled eggs*, the voice murmured. *Not Japanese. American South. But the technique translates.*

He boiled six eggs until they were just set, the yolks still slightly soft in their centers. While they cooled, he sliced the green onions and combined them with the vinegar, sugar he found in the pantry, and a splash of soy sauce for depth. A quick pickling liquid, improvised from what was available.

The peeled eggs went into a glass jar with the liquid and the green onions. He sealed it and set it aside to marinate.

*That will need time*, the voice said. *Hours, at least. But they'll be good.*

He trusted it. He was learning to trust it.


With the eggs marinating, he turned to the kitchen itself.

It needed cleaning—not because it was dirty, exactly, but because it could be cleaner. The kind of deep cleaning that went beyond daily maintenance, that addressed the accumulated film of months and years. Sheldon found a bucket, filled it with hot water and the cleaning soap Katsuhito kept under the sink, and began.

He started with the surfaces—counters, cabinets, the area around the stove where oil had splattered and been wiped away without being fully removed. The work was meditative, repetitive, the kind of labor that occupied the hands and freed the mind.

*Houses need care*, he thought, scrubbing at a stubborn spot near the rice cooker. *Not just repair, but care. Attention to the small things that accumulate into larger things.*

The Tsukino house would need this too—not just structural repair but cleaning, organizing, making habitable a space that had been empty too long. Yamada could fix the roof, could shore up the beams, but someone would need to address the dust, the cobwebs, the staleness of rooms that hadn't held life in years.

*I can do that*, he realized. *The physical work, the patient attention. I can give the house what it needs.*

The kitchen gleamed by the time he finished, surfaces reflecting the afternoon light that had finally broken through the clouds. He emptied the bucket, rinsed the cloth, and stepped back to admire his work.

It was small. It was domestic. It mattered.


Tenchi's return was announced by the sound of small feet on stone.

Sheldon was on the engawa when the bus arrived, sitting with a cup of tea he'd made himself, watching the shrine grounds dry in the emerging sun. The steps echoed with descending footsteps, and then a small voice called out—

"Sheldon-san! You're still here!"

The same greeting as yesterday, and the day before. The same joy, the same relief, as if each return was a small miracle that might not repeat.

"I'm still here," Sheldon confirmed. "How was school?"

Tenchi appeared at the top of the steps, cheeks flushed from the climb, backpack dangling from one shoulder. He dropped it on the engawa and settled beside Sheldon with the boneless ease of childhood.

"We learned about frogs," he announced. "Sensei showed us pictures. Did you know frogs start as dots?"

"Eggs," Sheldon said. "They start as eggs, and then they become tadpoles, and then they become frogs."

"Tadpoles are the wiggly ones with tails?"

"Yes."

"I want to see real tadpoles." Tenchi's eyes went wide with sudden inspiration. "Can we go look for them? There's a pond near the old tree. Grandfather says there are frogs there sometimes."

The old tree. The great tree in the courtyard, the one Sheldon's eyes always found without quite meaning to. He hadn't known there was a pond nearby—another detail of the shrine grounds he'd yet to explore.

"We can look," he said. "After you have a snack."

"Okay!" Tenchi scrambled up, already heading for the kitchen. "What's for snack?"

Sheldon thought of the eggs marinating in their jar—not ready yet, but interesting. "Onigiri," he said. "With pickled plum, if there's any left."

"There's always pickled plum. Grandmother made a lot."

Another mention of the grandmother—Katsuhito's wife, dead now but still present in preserved foods and careful mentions. Sheldon followed Tenchi into the kitchen, wondering how many years of pickled plum remained, and whether anyone would ever make more.


The pond was small and hidden.

It sat in a hollow behind the great tree, screened from view by a natural arrangement of rocks and bushes that suggested deliberate design—a garden feature, perhaps, from decades or centuries past. The water was clear despite the rain, fed by some underground source that kept it fresh.

Tenchi crouched at the edge, peering into the depths with the focused intensity only children could sustain. "I don't see any tadpoles."

"It might be too early in the season. Or too late in the day." Sheldon crouched beside him, studying the water. Small insects skated across the surface. Green things grew at the edges—water plants he couldn't identify. "Frogs are more active at dawn and dusk."

"Can we come back at dawn?"

"Maybe. If you wake up early enough."

"I can wake up early!" Tenchi's protest was undermined by a yawn that seemed to surprise him as much as anyone. "I'm not tired."

"Of course not."

They stayed by the pond for a while longer, watching for movement, pointing out things that caught their attention—a dragonfly, a leaf floating on the surface, the way the light filtered through the overhanging branches. The great tree rose behind them, its presence felt even when Sheldon wasn't looking at it.

*Beautiful*, he thought. *Old. Patient.*

The same words, every time. As if no others were adequate.


Katsuhito returned as the sun was beginning to lower.

He found Sheldon in the kitchen, preparing dinner—rice was already cooking, vegetables were sliced for miso soup, and the pickled eggs had been retrieved from their jar and cut into careful quarters.

"You cleaned," the old priest observed, looking around at the gleaming surfaces.

"I had time."

"Hmm." Katsuhito examined the egg quarters with interest. "What are these?"

"Something my grandmother used to make." The words came easily now—the blending of Dorothy's recipes with the created history of Sachiko, the truth that was also a lie. "Eggs pickled in vinegar and green onion. They're good with rice."

Katsuhito picked up a quarter and tasted it, chewing thoughtfully. His expression gave nothing away.

"Different," he said finally. "But good."

"Thank you."

"Tenchi will want to try them."

"I saved him some. They're his favorite color." Sheldon gestured to the jar, where the remaining eggs had taken on a pale greenish tint from the onion.

"Green is not his favorite color. That would be red."

"Then they're his new favorite color."

Something that might have been amusement crossed Katsuhito's face. "We'll see."


Dinner was a small celebration of the ordinary.

Tenchi did, in fact, declare the green eggs his new favorite, eating three quarters before being reminded that other foods existed. The miso soup was good—Sheldon's confidence with Japanese cooking growing with each attempt—and the rice was perfect, as always.

"Yamada-san will come tomorrow," Sheldon said over tea. "To look at the house."

Katsuhito nodded. "He mentioned you'd visited. Said you understood what needed doing."

"I hope so."

"Yamada-san doesn't say things he doesn't mean." The old priest set down his cup. "He also said I should tell you the beam is ready. He'll bring it when he comes for the inspection."

"The beam for the shrine?"

"For the engawa. One of the joists has been weakening. I asked him to prepare a replacement three months ago." Katsuhito's eyes held that measuring quality again. "He's been busy. But he's making time now."

The implication was clear: Yamada was expediting Sheldon's roof inspection because he'd been impressed by their meeting. The craftsman didn't waste time on people he didn't respect.

"I'll try to be useful while he's here," Sheldon said.

"I'm sure you will."


The evening settled into familiar patterns.

Tenchi demanded stories, which Katsuhito provided with the practiced ease of a grandfather who had told these tales many times before. Sheldon listened from the kitchen, washing dishes, the priest's low voice drifting through the house like incense.

The story was about a crane—a woman who transformed into a bird to repay a kindness, weaving feathers into cloth of impossible beauty. Sheldon recognized the tale from somewhere, though he couldn't have said where. Perhaps Dorothy had told it, or perhaps he'd read it in a book. Perhaps it was simply one of those stories that existed everywhere, in every culture, wearing different clothes but carrying the same heart.

When the dishes were done, he joined them in the main room. Tenchi had migrated into his grandfather's lap, eyes heavy but fighting sleep with the determination of the very young.

"Sheldon-san," the boy murmured. "Are you going to be here tomorrow?"

"Yes."

"And the day after?"

"Yes."

"And the day after that?"

"As far as I can see."

Tenchi's eyes drifted closed, satisfied. Katsuhito caught Sheldon's gaze over the boy's head, and something passed between them—not words, but understanding. Acknowledgment of what was being built, day by day, promise by promise.

*Five days*, Sheldon thought. *Five days, and this is becoming home.*

He didn't fight the thought anymore. He let it be.

#### Scene 5.C: Evening

"He never makes it to the end," Katsuhito murmured, more to himself than to Sheldon. "Twenty years I've been telling this story, and no one has ever stayed awake for the ending."

"What happens at the end?"

"She flies away. The husband breaks his promise and opens the door to watch her weave, and she has no choice but to leave." The old priest shifted Tenchi's weight, preparing to stand. "All the old stories end with someone leaving. The Japanese have never been comfortable with permanence."

Sheldon thought about that as Katsuhito carried Tenchi toward the bedrooms. Leaving and staying. Promises kept and broken. The crane who couldn't remain once she'd been seen for what she truly was.

*Would I fly away*, he wondered, *if someone opened the door?*

He didn't have wings. He didn't have anywhere to fly to. Whatever he was now—whatever he'd been made into—this was his only life. There was no going back to Atlanta, to the lab, to the man he'd been before the white light and the cherry blossoms.

*Maybe that's the difference*, he thought. *She had somewhere to return to. I don't.*


The dishes from dinner were few, easily handled.

Sheldon washed them by the light of the kitchen lamp, the window above the sink showing only darkness and the faint reflection of his own face. He looked tired—not exhausted, but worn in the way that came from a full day of doing things that mattered.

Tomorrow, Yamada would come to inspect the house. Tomorrow, numbers would be assigned to problems, and problems would begin their transformation into solutions. Tomorrow, the abstract idea of "restoration" would become concrete, measurable, actionable.

*One step at a time*, he told himself. *That's how you build anything. One step, and then the next.*

He dried the last bowl and set it in its place.


The bath was hot and quiet.

He soaked in the ofuro, water to his shoulders, steam rising around him in the lamplight. The day replayed behind his closed eyes: Yamada's workshop, the smell of cedar and clay; the pond behind the great tree, Tenchi's earnest search for tadpoles; Katsuhito's story, the crane weaving beauty from her own body.

*Five days.*

The count had become a kind of ritual, a way of marking progress through territory that had no other landmarks. Five days since waking in the field. Five days of learning names, learning routines, learning the shape of a life he hadn't chosen but was beginning to claim.

The water cooled slowly. He stayed until it was merely warm, then rose and dried himself and went to prepare for sleep.


The guest room had become familiar.

The ceiling beams, the paper screens, the particular quality of darkness that gathered in the corners—all of it registered now as *known* rather than *strange*. He'd slept here five nights. His body had learned the futon's contours, the way the pillow compressed, the sounds that meant safety versus the sounds that meant attention.

*This is mine now*, he thought, lying down. *This room, this routine, this place in the world.*

Not forever. The Tsukino house waited down the mountain, empty and patient, ready to become his in a different way. But for now—for these last weeks or months of transition—this room was home.

He closed his eyes and listened to the shrine settle around him.

Somewhere in the house, Katsuhito was doing whatever old priests did in the final hours before sleep. Somewhere closer, Tenchi was dreaming whatever children dreamed—frogs, perhaps, or cranes, or the promise that someone would still be there tomorrow.

*I'll be there*, Sheldon thought. *Tomorrow and the day after. As far as I can see.*

Sleep came gently, carrying him into darkness without dreams.


- "All the old stories end with someone leaving"
- Katsuhito: "The Japanese have never been comfortable with permanence"

**Sheldon's Reflection:**
- Compared self to crane

#### Scene 6.A: Sixth Morning

The sixth morning arrived with clear skies and the particular stillness that followed rain.

Sheldon woke to light streaming through the paper screens, brighter than it had been yesterday, carrying the promise of a day suited for outdoor work. He lay in the futon for a moment, listening to the shrine settle around him, then rose and began his preparation.

Today was the inspection. Today, Yamada would walk the roof of the Tsukino house and turn Sheldon's amateur observations into professional assessment. Today, the abstract concept of "restoration" would acquire numbers, timelines, costs.

*Today*, he thought, *things become real.*


Breakfast was quieter than usual.

Tenchi seemed subdued, pushing rice around his bowl rather than eating with his typical enthusiasm. Katsuhito watched his grandson with an expression Sheldon couldn't quite read—not concern exactly, but attention. Awareness.

"Is something wrong?" Sheldon asked.

Tenchi looked up, then back at his rice. "Father's coming today."

The words landed in the silence with unexpected weight. Sheldon had known, abstractly, that Nobuyuki Masaki visited on weekends—Katsuhito had mentioned it that first evening, a fact filed away among dozens of others. But knowing and experiencing were different things.

"That's good," Sheldon said carefully. "You must miss him during the week."

"Yeah." Tenchi's voice was small. "He stays in my room sometimes. The one you're in."

*The guest room.* The room Sheldon had been sleeping in for six nights—Nobuyuki's childhood room, still holding his belongings, still belonging to him in ways Sheldon hadn't fully considered.

"Should I—" He hesitated. "Should I move my things? Give you and your father space?"

"No!" Tenchi's response was immediate, alarmed. "I didn't mean—I want you to stay. I was just saying."

Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "Nobuyuki won't arrive until evening. He works half-days on Saturday." A pause. "You'll meet him then. For now, you have other business."

The dismissal was gentle but clear: deal with the house first, the family dynamics later. Sheldon nodded and finished his breakfast in silence.


Yamada arrived at the shrine precisely at eight o'clock.

He drove a small truck—white, practical, with a ladder rack on top and wooden crates visible in the bed. When he emerged from the cab, he was carrying a leather bag that clinked with tools and a clipboard thick with papers.

"Tsukino." The greeting was a nod, nothing more.

"Yamada-san. Thank you for coming."

"Brought the beam for Katsuhito-sensei." Yamada gestured to the truck bed, where a heavy timber lay among the crates. "We'll unload it after. House first."

They walked down the mountain together, following the path Sheldon had learned by now—past the second torii, left at the fork, through the green tunnel of overhanging branches. Yamada walked in silence, his eyes moving constantly, noting things Sheldon couldn't identify. Assessing.

The Tsukino house emerged from the trees as it had before: quiet, patient, waiting. In the morning light, the overgrown garden looked less melancholy than it had on his first visit—more wild than neglected, full of potential rather than loss.

Yamada stopped at the edge of the property and studied the building with the intensity of a doctor examining a patient.

"Hmm," he said. It was not an encouraging sound.


The inspection took three hours.

Yamada moved through the house systematically, starting with the exterior and working inward. He climbed onto the roof using his own ladder, walking the tiles with the confidence of a man who had spent decades doing exactly this. Sheldon watched from below, cataloguing the places where Yamada paused, crouched, took notes.

Inside, the roofer examined the crawl space Sheldon had found, confirming the rot in the support beams and identifying additional damage Sheldon had missed. He tested the engawa boards with his boot heel, marked the soft ones with chalk, checked the posts and joists beneath.

Sheldon followed him, answering questions when asked, staying silent otherwise. This was Yamada's domain, and Sheldon was here to learn.

"You were right about the two beams," Yamada said finally, emerging from the crawl space and dusting off his knees. "But there's a third—small section, easy to miss. And the underlayment along the south eave needs replacement, not just the tiles."

He led Sheldon outside and pointed upward, tracing lines Sheldon couldn't see from the ground.

"Water gets in here—" A gap in the tiles. "Runs along here—" A channel in the structure. "And collects here—" The corner where the damage was worst. "Been doing it for years. Previous owners probably patched it, but patches don't last."

"What would you recommend?"

Yamada was silent for a long moment, still looking at the roof. Then he turned to Sheldon with an expression that was almost—but not quite—approving.

"Full roof work. Replace the damaged tiles—about forty of them. New underlayment for the south and east sections. Three beam repairs. Flashing around the chimney." He pulled out his clipboard and began writing. "Two weeks of work, maybe three. Depends on weather."

"And the cost?"

The number Yamada named was higher than Sheldon's estimate—not by much, but enough to notice. ¥280,000 for materials and labor, paid in installments as work progressed.

"That includes my time," Yamada added. "I don't usually do labor estimates, but you seem like someone who understands work. Wouldn't feel right padding it."

Sheldon did the math in his head. After the roof, he would still have over ¥500,000—enough for the other repairs, utilities, living expenses. It was tight but manageable.

"When can you start?"

Yamada's eyebrows rose slightly—surprise at the quick decision, perhaps. "Monday. If the weather holds."

"Then Monday it is."

They shook hands. Yamada's grip was firm, calloused, the handshake of a man who meant what he said and expected the same in return.


They walked back up the mountain in companionable silence.

The shrine appeared through the trees, and with it the sound of voices—Tenchi's high and bright, and another that Sheldon didn't recognize. Deeper, adult, male.

*Nobuyuki*, he thought. *Earlier than expected.*

The courtyard came into view, and there he was: a man in his thirties or forties, dressed in the kind of casual clothing that suggested a professional relaxing on his day off. He was crouched near the great tree, listening to something Tenchi was explaining with animated gestures.

He looked up as Sheldon and Yamada approached, and for a moment their eyes met.

Sheldon saw: curiosity, wariness, the protective assessment of a father encountering a stranger in his child's life. Dark hair, glasses, the faint lines around the eyes that came from smiling often or squinting at detailed work. The architect. The weekend father. The man whose childhood room Sheldon had been sleeping in.

Nobuyuki saw: a tall Black man in work clothes, walking alongside the village roofer, arriving at his family's shrine with the ease of someone who belonged there.

The moment stretched.

Then Yamada broke the tension with a grunt and a nod. "Nobuyuki-san. Brought your father's beam."

"Yamada-san." Nobuyuki stood, and the protective assessment flickered into something more neutral—recognition of a familiar face, the social reflex of greeting before evaluating. "Father mentioned it was ready."

"This is Tsukino Sheldon," Yamada said, gesturing. "The one fixing up the old Tsukino place."

Nobuyuki turned back to Sheldon. "So I've heard. Tenchi hasn't stopped talking about you since I arrived."

"I hope good things."

"Very good things. He says you make better curry than I do." A hint of a smile, rueful and genuine. "He's probably right. I've never been much of a cook."

The tension eased, not entirely gone but manageable. Nobuyuki offered his hand, and Sheldon shook it—another firm grip, another handshake between men who didn't know yet what they would be to each other.

"Welcome," Nobuyuki said. "I understand you've been helping around the shrine."

"Trying to. Your father has been very generous."

"He has his reasons." Something flickered in Nobuyuki's expression—knowledge, or suspicion, or simply the awareness of a son who knew his father kept secrets. "We should talk later. After dinner, perhaps."

"I'd like that."

Yamada cleared his throat. "Beam needs unloading. Nobuyuki-san, you mind helping?"

The moment passed. Work resumed. But Sheldon felt the weight of what had just happened—the introduction, the assessment, the beginning of something that would need to be navigated carefully in the days ahead.

Tenchi appeared at his side as the men moved toward the truck.

"That's my father," the boy said, with a mixture of pride and something like anxiety. "He works very hard."

"I can tell."

"He likes you." Tenchi's confidence was absolute, based on evidence invisible to adults. "I can tell too."

Sheldon hoped the boy was right.


- "Been doing it for years. Previous owners probably patched it."

#### Scene 6.B: The Afternoon

The beam was heavier than it looked.

Sheldon helped Yamada and Nobuyuki wrestle it from the truck bed, the timber solid in his hands, smelling of fresh-cut cedar. They carried it to the side of the main building and laid it on supports Katsuhito had prepared, the old priest directing placement with quiet precision.

"Good wood," Nobuyuki said, running a hand along the grain. "Yamada-san, where did you source it?"

"Tanaka Jiro's cousin. Has a stand of cedar up near Niimi. Knows how to dry it proper." Yamada was already climbing back into his truck. "I'll be back Monday. Tsukino, have the house open by eight."

"I'll be there."

The truck departed, leaving the four of them in the suddenly quiet courtyard—Sheldon, Nobuyuki, Katsuhito, and Tenchi, who had been watching the whole operation from a safe distance with the fascination of a child who loved watching adults do physical work.

"Well," Nobuyuki said, brushing sawdust from his hands. "That's done."

"Thank you for your help," Sheldon offered.

"It's my father's shrine." A slight smile, not unfriendly. "Least I can do."

Tenchi broke from his observation post and ran to his father's side, tugging at his sleeve. "Father, Sheldon-san made pickled eggs yesterday. Green ones. They're really good. Can we have them for lunch?"

Nobuyuki looked at Sheldon with something that might have been amusement. "Green eggs?"

"The green onion gives them color. They're—" Sheldon hesitated. "They're something my grandmother used to make."

"American style?"

"A hybrid, I suppose."

Nobuyuki's expression was unreadable for a moment. Then he nodded. "I'd like to try them."


Lunch was an exercise in careful navigation.

Sheldon prepared it—the remaining pickled eggs, rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables from Katsuhito's stores. Nothing elaborate, but solid. The kind of meal that said *competent* without saying *showing off*.

They ate at the low table in the main room, Tenchi positioned strategically between his father and his grandfather, stealing glances at both adults and at Sheldon in turn. The boy was vibrating with barely contained energy, the kind that came from having all his people in one place and not knowing how to make them fit together.

"Father says you're from America," Nobuyuki said between bites. "But you speak Japanese very well."

"My mother taught me." The familiar story, growing smoother with each telling. "She wanted me to know my heritage."

"And your father?"

"American. They divorced when I was young."

Nobuyuki nodded, accepting this without pressing further. He was good at reading social cues, Sheldon noticed—knew when to ask and when to let things be. An architect's precision applied to human interaction.

"The eggs are good," Nobuyuki added. "Different from what I'm used to, but good."

"Thank you."

Tenchi beamed, as if the compliment had been directed at him personally.


The afternoon passed in domestic rhythms.

Nobuyuki spent time with Tenchi—walking the shrine grounds, examining the great tree together, answering the endless questions that children asked when reunited with absent parents. Sheldon kept his distance, occupying himself with small tasks around the residence, giving father and son space to reconnect.

But he watched, when he could. The way Nobuyuki crouched to Tenchi's level. The way his hand rested on the boy's shoulder. The careful attention of a man who knew his time was limited and wanted to make it count.

*He loves his son*, Sheldon thought. *Genuinely, deeply, despite the distance.*

It was both reassuring and complicated. Reassuring because Tenchi deserved that love, needed it in ways that went beyond what a temporary guest could provide. Complicated because Sheldon's presence changed the equation—added another adult to a system that had found its balance, disrupted patterns that had been working well enough.

*I'm not trying to replace you*, he thought, watching Nobuyuki lift Tenchi onto his shoulders. *I'm just... here.*

Whether that was enough, or too much, remained to be seen.


Dinner was Sheldon's domain.

He'd claimed the kitchen mid-afternoon, waving off Katsuhito's half-hearted offer to help. This was something he could do—something concrete to contribute, a way of demonstrating value that didn't require explaining mysteries he couldn't explain.

The menu came to him without conscious planning: grilled fish (fresh from the village, purchased that morning by Katsuhito), rice (always rice), vegetables sautéed with garlic and a touch of soy sauce, clear soup with tofu and green onion. Simple but careful. Each element given attention.

*Cook for the table you have*, the voice suggested. *Four people, four different needs. Feed them all.*

He found himself adjusting portions, considering preferences he'd observed over six days. Tenchi liked things slightly sweet; Katsuhito preferred subtle flavors; Nobuyuki was an unknown, but architects appreciated balance and proportion.

The meal came together in the quiet concentration that cooking always brought him now—hands moving, mind settling, the world narrowing to the immediate tasks of heat and timing and taste.


They ate by lamplight.

The sun had set during preparation, and Katsuhito had lit the traditional lamps rather than switching on the electric lights. The effect was warm, intimate, the kind of lighting that softened edges and encouraged conversation.

"This is excellent," Nobuyuki said, and there was genuine surprise in his voice. "Tenchi wasn't exaggerating."

"He rarely does," Katsuhito observed mildly. "About food, at least."

"I exaggerate about other things," Tenchi said, with the self-aware honesty of a child who'd been caught in small fibs before.

"Like what?"

"Like how far I can throw rocks. And how many stars I can count."

"Those seem like important things to exaggerate about," Nobuyuki said, his smile genuine now, the careful assessment fading into something warmer.

Sheldon ate and listened, contributing when addressed but mostly observing. The family had its own language—references to shared memories, shorthand born from years of knowing each other. He was an outsider to that language, could only catch the edges of meaning without understanding the full vocabulary.

But he was learning. Day by day, meal by meal, he was learning.


After dinner, Nobuyuki found him on the engawa.

Tenchi had been put to bed—reluctantly, with promises of a full day together tomorrow—and Katsuhito had retreated to whatever evening rituals occupied him. The shrine was quiet in that particular way of evening, full of sounds that were really just varieties of silence.

"May I?" Nobuyuki gestured to the space beside Sheldon.

"Of course."

They sat together, looking out at the darkened courtyard, the great tree a shape against the stars. Two men who didn't know each other, sharing space in the way that strangers sometimes did when circumstances threw them together.

"My father likes you," Nobuyuki said finally. "That's not nothing."

"I've tried to be useful."

"I can see that." A pause. "He's not an easy man to impress. Or to earn. But he's let you into his kitchen, his home, his grandson's life. That means something."

"I'm grateful for his generosity."

"Gratitude is one thing." Nobuyuki's voice was careful, measured. "Understanding is another. Do you understand what you've walked into?"

Sheldon considered the question. He could answer truthfully—*no, I don't understand anything, I woke up in a field six days ago with someone else's memories and a body that isn't mine*—but that truth wouldn't serve anyone.

"I understand that Tenchi needs people who will stay," he said instead. "I understand that your father is carrying burdens I can't see. And I understand that I'm a stranger who's been given more trust than I've earned."

Nobuyuki was silent for a long moment.

"That's... more than I expected."

"I'm good at observing. It's what I do."

"Did. What you did. You said you were a scientist."

"In another life." The words came out before Sheldon could stop them, truer than he'd intended. "Now I'm just someone trying to figure out where I belong."

"And you think you belong here?"

The question hung between them, heavy with implications. Here, in this village. Here, in this family. Here, in the room that had once been Nobuyuki's, caring for the son Nobuyuki couldn't raise himself.

"I think I could," Sheldon said carefully. "If I'm allowed."

Another long silence. Then Nobuyuki exhaled, something in his posture relaxing.

"Tenchi hasn't attached to anyone since his mother died. Not like this. He talks about you like you've been here forever." A pause. "That scares me a little. But it also... it also gives me hope."

"I won't hurt him."

"I don't think you will. I think if you were going to, my father would have seen it and stopped it." Nobuyuki turned to look at Sheldon directly, glasses reflecting the faint starlight. "He sees things, my father. More than he says. If he's accepted you, there's a reason."

*There's a reason.* Sheldon thought of Katsuhito's measuring eyes, the questions asked and unasked, the careful observation that had been constant since the first day. If the old priest had reasons for accepting a stranger into his home, Sheldon didn't know them—but he was beginning to suspect they went beyond simple hospitality.

"I should go check on Tenchi," Nobuyuki said, rising. "He doesn't always stay asleep when he knows I'm here."

"Good night, Nobuyuki-san."

"Good night, Tsukino-san." A pause at the door. "Thank you. For the meal. And the honesty."

He disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the night and the tree and the questions that wouldn't resolve themselves no matter how many times he asked them.

*If he's accepted you, there's a reason.*

Sheldon looked at the great tree, its branches barely visible against the stars, and wondered what that reason might be.


- "Tenchi needs people who will stay"
- "Your father is carrying burdens I can't see"
- "I'm a stranger given more trust than I've earned"
- "I won't hurt him"

#### Scene 6.C: Evening

The night settled around the shrine like a familiar blanket.

Sheldon remained on the engawa after Nobuyuki went inside, watching the darkness deepen over the courtyard. The great tree stood patient against the stars, its branches barely visible, its presence felt rather than seen.

*If he's accepted you, there's a reason.*

The words circled in his mind, seeking purchase. Nobuyuki had meant Katsuhito—meant that the old priest's approval wasn't given lightly, that it implied something about Sheldon that Sheldon himself didn't understand. But the words applied more broadly than that.

If he was here at all, there was a reason.

Someone—something—had pulled him from death and placed him in this body, in this life, in this village at the foot of a mountain shrine. Had given him skills he'd never learned and removed limitations he'd carried for decades. Had made him *new* in ways he still couldn't fully catalogue.

Why?

The question had no answer. It had had no answer for six days, and he suspected it would have no answer for six years, or sixty. Some mysteries didn't resolve themselves on convenient timelines. Some mysteries were meant to be lived rather than solved.

*Maybe that's enough*, he thought. *Maybe living it is the answer.*


Inside, the house had grown quiet.

He found the main room empty, the dinner dishes already washed—Katsuhito's work, done without comment while Sheldon had been talking with Nobuyuki. The old priest had retreated to his own quarters, and the sounds from Tenchi's room suggested that Nobuyuki had indeed found his son awake and was reading him back to sleep.

The guest room—Nobuyuki's childhood room, now Sheldon's temporary space—waited at the end of the hall. He entered quietly, closed the door behind him, and stood for a moment in the darkness.

*This was his room*, he thought. *His childhood. His memories.*

And now it held Sheldon's futon, Sheldon's few possessions, the accumulated weight of six nights' occupation. The scroll painting on the wall had been Nobuyuki's choice; the wooden chest had held Nobuyuki's belongings. Layers of history, one family's past becoming another stranger's present.

Tomorrow, Nobuyuki would be here all day—a full Sunday with his son, the kind of unhurried time that weekday schedules rarely allowed. And Monday, the roof repair would begin, and the house down the mountain would start its transformation from abandoned shell to livable home.

*Soon*, Sheldon thought, *I'll have my own space. My own walls. My own room that doesn't belong to someone else's memories.*

But for now, this room was home. This room, with its borrowed past and its uncertain future, was where he belonged.

He changed into sleeping clothes, laid out the futon, and settled into the familiar contours of rest.


Sleep didn't come immediately.

He lay in the darkness, listening to the shrine's nighttime sounds—the settling of wood, the distant call of an owl, the faint murmur of voices from Tenchi's room where Nobuyuki was still talking his son toward dreams. The sounds were becoming known to him now, catalogued and categorized, part of the mental map he was building of this place.

*Six days.*

Tomorrow would be seven. A week since he'd woken in the field, a week since the cherry blossoms and the white truck and the man who'd offered a ride to a stranger. A week of learning names, learning routines, learning the shape of a life he was still discovering.

He thought about the roof inspection, the formal numbers Yamada had provided. ¥280,000 to repair what time had damaged. Two to three weeks of work, if weather cooperated. The old Tsukino house would become new again—not new in the way Sheldon's body was new, sudden and complete, but new in the slower way of human effort. Board by board. Tile by tile. Day by day.

*That's how you build anything*, he thought. *Slowly. Carefully. One piece at a time.*

He was building something here. Not just a house, but a life. Not just repairs, but relationships. Not just restoration, but belonging.

The sleep that finally came was deep and dreamless, carrying him through the night toward whatever tomorrow would bring.

#### Scene 7.A: Seventh Day

The seventh day belonged to Nobuyuki.

Sheldon understood this from the moment he woke—understood it in the way the shrine felt different, the energy shifted toward a configuration that didn't include him at its center. Father and son needed time. Father and son needed space. Sheldon's role today was to be present without being intrusive, useful without being indispensable.

He rose early, before the household stirred, and went to the kitchen.


Breakfast was waiting when the family emerged.

Simple fare—rice, miso soup, grilled fish, pickled vegetables—but prepared with care and set out in portions that suggested whoever had made it understood the day's priorities. Sheldon had eaten already, his bowl washed and put away, his presence reduced to the evidence of his labor.

"You didn't have to do this," Nobuyuki said, surveying the table.

"I wanted to. It's the least I can do." Sheldon was already pulling on his work jacket. "I'll be at the house today. Preparing for tomorrow."

Katsuhito caught his eye across the kitchen. Something passed between them—understanding, or perhaps approval. The old priest nodded once, almost imperceptibly.

"We'll save you dinner," Nobuyuki said.

"Thank you."

Sheldon left before Tenchi could protest, slipping out the door and down the mountain path while the sun was still low in the sky. Behind him, he could hear the boy's voice rising in question—*Where's Sheldon-san going?*—and Nobuyuki's patient response.

*He'll be back*, Sheldon thought. *He'll learn that I always come back.*


The Tsukino house was cold with morning.

He opened the doors and shutters, letting light and air flood through rooms that had been sealed since his last visit. Dust motes danced in the sunbeams. The photograph album waited in its drawer, undisturbed. The Japanese-English dictionary still sat on the desk in the study, a relic of someone else's learning.

*Tomorrow*, he thought. *Tomorrow, Yamada begins.*

But there was work he could do today. Work that didn't require a professional's expertise, only willingness and time.

He started with the garden.


The overgrowth yielded to effort.

Sheldon worked through the morning, pulling weeds that had claimed the vegetable patch, clearing paths that had disappeared under years of neglect. His hands—these new hands, strong and capable—found the rhythm of the work quickly, moving from task to task with an efficiency that would have been impossible in his old body.

By noon, the outline of the garden was visible again. Stone paths emerged from beneath their green shroud. The pond's edges became distinct, algae retreating under his methodical attention. The maple tree still needed pruning, but its base was clear now, the stone bench beneath it brushed clean of moss.

He sat on that bench and ate the onigiri he'd packed, looking at what he'd accomplished.

*Not much*, by some standards. A few hours of labor, a small section of neglected ground. But it was *his* labor, his ground, his progress toward something he could call home.

The afternoon stretched ahead, full of possibility.


He was cleaning the kitchen when the sound reached him.

Footsteps on the overgrown path—small ones, quick, accompanied by larger ones moving more slowly. Sheldon set down his rag and went to the front door.

Tenchi burst into view first, face flushed with exertion and excitement. "Sheldon-san! We came to find you!"

Behind him, Nobuyuki appeared at a more measured pace. He was carrying a basket, and his expression held something Sheldon couldn't quite read—amusement, perhaps, or resignation.

"He insisted," Nobuyuki said. "Wouldn't take no for an answer. Kept saying you'd be hungry."

"I'm fine. I brought food."

"I told him that." Nobuyuki set the basket down on the engawa. "He didn't believe me."

Tenchi had already darted past Sheldon into the house, his curiosity overwhelming any sense of propriety. "Is this your house? It's old! There's dust everywhere! Can I explore?"

"Carefully," Sheldon said. "Some of the floors are soft."

The boy vanished into the interior, his footsteps echoing through empty rooms. Sheldon and Nobuyuki stood in the doorway, listening to the sounds of childhood discovery.

"He missed you," Nobuyuki said quietly. "All morning. Kept looking toward the path, asking when you'd be back."

"I wanted to give you time together."

"I know. And I appreciate it." Nobuyuki's gaze swept over the visible garden work, the cleared paths, the progress Sheldon had made. "You've been busy."

"There's a lot to do."

"There always is." A pause. "My father says you're the hardest worker he's seen in years. Coming from him, that's significant."

*Katsuhito said that.* Sheldon filed the information away, uncertain what to do with it. "I just... I need something to do. Something to build. Otherwise I start thinking too much."

"About what?"

The question was gentle, not prying. An architect's instinct for understanding structures—including human ones.

"About how I got here. About why." Sheldon watched Tenchi's shadow pass a window. "About whether I deserve any of this."

"Do any of us deserve what we get?" Nobuyuki's voice was soft with something that might have been recognition. "I didn't deserve Kiyone. I didn't deserve Tenchi. But I got them anyway, and I try to be worthy of the gift."

*Kiyone.* Tenchi's mother. The woman who had died, leaving a husband in the city and a son at the shrine and a hole in a family that was still trying to heal.

"I'm sorry for your loss," Sheldon said.

"It was years ago. But thank you." Nobuyuki straightened. "We should eat. Tenchi will have worked up an appetite by now."


They ate on the engawa, the three of them, with the clearing garden spread before them.

The basket held onigiri shaped by Nobuyuki's inexpert hands—lopsided but earnest—and pickled vegetables and fruit that had clearly been packed by Katsuhito. Tenchi ate with the enthusiasm of a child who had burned energy exploring, chattering between bites about what he'd found in the house.

"There's a room with books! And a room with a big mirror! And a room that's just empty, but it has a nice window!"

"The study, the bedroom, and the spare room," Sheldon said. "I'll need to decide what to do with each of them."

"You could make the empty one a playroom," Tenchi suggested. "For when I visit."

The assumption—*when I visit*, not *if*—landed in Sheldon's chest like a small warm stone.

"Maybe I could."

Nobuyuki said nothing, but his expression suggested he'd heard what his son had assumed, and didn't disapprove.


They walked back to the shrine together as the afternoon aged.

Tenchi ran ahead, then circled back, then ran ahead again—the perpetual motion of childhood, burning energy without apparent source. Nobuyuki and Sheldon walked at an adult pace, letting the boy orbit around them like a small, enthusiastic planet.

"Tomorrow, the roof work starts," Sheldon said.

"Father mentioned. Yamada-san is good. He's done work on the shrine before."

"That's what I heard."

"The house will be livable soon." Nobuyuki's voice was carefully neutral. "You'll be moving out of the residence."

"Yes. Eventually."

"Tenchi will miss you."

"I'll visit. Every day, if I'm allowed."

"You'll be allowed." Nobuyuki glanced at him. "Whatever my father sees in you, he's not wrong. I've learned to trust his judgment, even when I don't understand it."

*What my father sees in you.* Another reference to Katsuhito's perception, to the things the old priest noticed that others didn't. Sheldon wondered, not for the first time, exactly what Katsuhito had seen—and what it meant.

"Thank you," he said. "For bringing Tenchi. For... for accepting this."

"I'm not sure I have a choice." Nobuyuki's smile was rueful. "My son chose you. My father chose you. I'm just trying to keep up."

They emerged from the forest onto the shrine grounds, the great tree rising before them, Tenchi already racing toward the main building with news of their return.

*One week*, Sheldon thought. *One week, and somehow I've been chosen.*

He still didn't know by whom. Or why. But maybe, as he'd thought last night, living the answer was enough.

#### Scene 8.A: The Nightmare

The eighth day began with hammering.

Sheldon was at the Tsukino house by seven-thirty, unlocking the door for Yamada and helping unload materials from the roofer's truck. Tiles, underlayment, lumber for beam repairs—the components of restoration stacked neatly in the overgrown garden while Yamada surveyed the roof with professional intensity.

"Weather looks good through Thursday," Yamada said, more words at once than he usually offered. "We start with the south side. That's where the worst damage is."

"What do you need from me?"

"Stay out of my way. Bring tea at ten and two. Ask questions if you don't understand something." Yamada was already climbing his ladder. "Learning is free. Stupidity costs money."

Sheldon filed this philosophy away and retreated to the garden, where the morning's work waited. The clearing he'd begun on Sunday needed continuation—weeds that had returned despite his efforts, paths that wanted further definition, the maple tree that still required pruning.

He worked through the morning, pausing only to bring Yamada tea as instructed. The sound of the roofer's labor formed a constant backdrop—tiles being pried loose, wood being tested, the occasional grunt of discovery or disapproval. Progress, measured in small sounds and systematic effort.

By noon, the south side of the roof was stripped to its bones.


## Part II: The Return

He walked back to the shrine in the early afternoon, leaving Yamada to continue alone.

The path had become familiar now—eight days of walking it in various directions, at various times, until his feet knew the way without conscious thought. Past the fork, past the second torii, up the green tunnel of overhanging branches. The shrine emerged through the trees like something waiting to be found.

Tenchi wasn't at the bus stop yet—too early, still another hour before kindergarten released—but Katsuhito was on the engawa, working on something with his hands. As Sheldon approached, he saw it was a small wooden figure, being shaped with careful knife strokes.

"How does the work proceed?" Katsuhito asked without looking up.

"Yamada stripped the south side this morning. He found more damage than expected in the second support beam, but says it's manageable."

"Yamada-san always finds more damage than expected. It's his way of preparing clients for the bill." The old priest set down his carving. "Did you learn anything?"

"That I know nothing about roofing." Sheldon settled onto the engawa beside him. "But I'm learning."

"That's all anyone can do."

They sat in companionable silence, the afternoon settling around them. The great tree cast its shadow across the courtyard, and Sheldon's eyes found it again—that automatic draw, like gravity, like instinct.

"The boy missed you yesterday," Katsuhito said quietly. "While you were at the house."

"I know. He came to find me."

"With his father." A pause. "Nobuyuki told me about your conversation. He said you were honest with him."

"I tried to be."

"Honesty is rarer than people think. Especially about things we don't understand." Katsuhito picked up his carving again, the knife resuming its patient work. "Nobuyuki left this morning, before Tenchi woke. The boy was... quiet at breakfast. More than usual."

Sheldon thought about that. Tenchi, waking to find his father gone without goodbye. The familiar pattern of weekend visits ending in Monday-morning absences. The weight of loving someone who couldn't stay.

"I'll be here when he gets home," Sheldon said.

"I thought you might."


## Part III: The Evening

Tenchi's return was subdued.

He came up the steps with his backpack dragging, none of the usual energy in his movements. When he saw Sheldon on the engawa, his face flickered—hope, relief, something that might have been desperation—before settling into a careful neutrality that no four-year-old should have mastered.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi. How was school?"

"Fine." The word was flat, dismissive. "We did painting."

"What did you paint?"

"A house." Tenchi sat down on the engawa, leaving space between himself and Sheldon. More space than usual. "It wasn't very good."

"I'd like to see it."

"I threw it away."

The silence that followed was heavy with things unsaid. Sheldon waited, letting Tenchi work through whatever he was working through, not pushing but not retreating either. Present. Available. There.

"Father left," Tenchi said finally.

"I know."

"He didn't say goodbye."

"He didn't want to wake you."

"He never wants to wake me." The words came out bitter, older than Tenchi's years. "He just leaves and then he's gone and I don't see him until Saturday and Saturday is forever away."

Sheldon didn't have an answer to that. No words that could bridge the gap between a child's need and a father's obligations, between love that wanted to stay and life that demanded departure.

"I'm here," he said instead. "I'm not going anywhere."

Tenchi looked at him—really looked, searching for something in Sheldon's face. Whatever he found must have been enough, because after a long moment he shifted closer, closing the gap he'd created.

"Okay," he said. "Okay."


Dinner was quiet.

Sheldon made comfort food—rice porridge with umeboshi, the kind of soft, warm meal that asked nothing of the person eating it. Tenchi ate mechanically, spoon moving from bowl to mouth without enthusiasm. Katsuhito watched them both with the patient attention of someone who had seen this pattern before.

"Bath time soon," the old priest said as the meal wound down. "Would you like me to read you a story tonight, Tenchi?"

"No." The word was small but firm. "I want to go to bed early."

"Are you feeling unwell?"

"I'm just tired."

He wasn't tired. Sheldon could see it in the set of his shoulders, the tightness around his eyes. He was bracing for something—the dark, the dreams, the long hours until morning.

"I'll wash the dishes," Sheldon offered. "And then I'll be in my room. If you need anything."

Tenchi nodded, not meeting his eyes.


## Part IV: The Night

Sleep didn't come easily.

Sheldon lay in the guest room—Nobuyuki's childhood room, the room that held so many layers of this family's history—and listened to the shrine settle into nighttime silence. The wind in the trees. The occasional creak of old wood. The distant call of a night bird.

He'd been asleep for perhaps two hours when the sound woke him.

A cry. High, thin, terrified—the sound of a child in the grip of something that couldn't be reasoned with or bargained away. It came from Tenchi's room, through the thin walls that separated their spaces.

Sheldon was on his feet before he fully registered moving.


The hallway was dark, lit only by the faint glow of Tenchi's nightlight spilling from beneath his door. Sheldon moved toward it without hesitation, the floor cold against his bare feet, the sound of crying growing clearer with each step.

He knocked once, softly. "Tenchi?"

No answer except sobs—the breathless, gulping kind that meant panic rather than simple distress.

Sheldon opened the door.

Tenchi was tangled in his blankets, thrashing against imaginary restraints, face wet with tears. His eyes were open but unseeing, fixed on something in the nightmare realm that Sheldon couldn't reach.

"Mama," the boy was saying. "Mama, don't go. Mama, please—"

Sheldon crossed the room in two steps and knelt beside the futon.

"Tenchi." He kept his voice calm, steady. "Tenchi, wake up. You're dreaming. It's just a dream."

The boy's eyes didn't focus. His hands reached out, grasping at air, at absence, at the ghost of someone who had left too soon and too permanently.

"Mama—"

"Tenchi." Sheldon reached out and touched his shoulder—gently, carefully, the way you touched something fragile. "I'm here. You're safe. Wake up, Tenchi. Wake up."

The touch seemed to break through where words hadn't. Tenchi's eyes blinked, focused, found Sheldon's face in the dim light of the nightlight. For a moment he stared, not comprehending—and then recognition flooded in, and with it fresh tears.

"Sheldon-san—"

"I'm here."

The boy threw himself forward, small arms wrapping around Sheldon's neck with desperate strength. He was trembling, his whole body shaking with the aftershocks of terror. Sheldon caught him, held him, pulled him close.

"I'm here," he said again. "I've got you. You're safe."

"I was dreaming—" Tenchi's voice was muffled against Sheldon's shoulder. "I was dreaming about—about—"

"I know. I know."

"She went away. In the dream she went away and I couldn't—I couldn't make her stay—"

"I know."

They stayed like that, Sheldon holding Tenchi on the floor of his small room, the nightlight casting everything in soft gold. The boy's trembling slowly eased, his grip slowly loosened, his breathing slowly steadied. But he didn't let go.

"Will you stay?" The question was barely a whisper. "Until I fall asleep?"

"Yes."

"Do you promise?"

"I promise."


## Part V: The Vigil

Sheldon settled against the wall, Tenchi curled in his lap.

The boy was small—so small, lighter than Sheldon had expected, all sharp angles and soft skin and the particular warmth of childhood. His head rested against Sheldon's chest, rising and falling with each breath. His hands clutched the fabric of Sheldon's sleeping yukata with the grip of someone afraid to let go.

The room was quiet except for breathing.

Sheldon watched the shadows move on the ceiling as the hours passed. He didn't sleep—wouldn't sleep, not with this small life depending on him to be present, to be real, to be the anchor that held against the darkness. His back ached from the awkward position. His legs fell asleep and woke again with pins and needles. None of it mattered.

*This is what it means*, he thought. *To be chosen. To be needed. To be here.*

Dorothy had held him like this once, when he was small and scared and the world seemed too big to face. He remembered the warmth of her, the steadiness, the absolute certainty that nothing could hurt him as long as she was there. He hadn't thought about that memory in years—decades, maybe. But it rose now, unbidden, called up by the weight of the child in his arms.

*This is what you gave me*, he thought. *And now I give it forward.*

Tenchi murmured something in his sleep, too soft to understand. His grip tightened momentarily, then relaxed. He was dreaming again—but not the nightmare, not the terror. Something gentler. Something safe.


The door opened silently around two in the morning.

Katsuhito stood in the hallway, silhouetted by moonlight from somewhere deeper in the house. He looked at the scene before him—Sheldon against the wall, Tenchi sleeping in his lap, the nightlight burning steady—and said nothing.

For a long moment they simply regarded each other, two men who had been strangers eight days ago, bound now by circumstance and choice and the child who connected them.

Then Katsuhito nodded, once, and withdrew. The door closed softly behind him.

Sheldon stayed until dawn.

#### Scene 9.A: The Morning After

Sheldon watched it brighten by degrees, his back against the wall, his legs numb, his arms still curved around the small weight that had barely moved in hours. Tenchi's breathing was slow and even now—real sleep, the kind that came after exhaustion, not the fitful half-rest of nightmares.

He didn't want to move. Moving would break the spell, would return them both to the world of schedules and obligations and the ordinary business of Tuesday mornings. But the light was growing, and soon the household would stir, and Tenchi had school.

"Tenchi." His voice came out rough from hours of silence. "Time to wake up."

The boy shifted, murmured something unintelligible, burrowed closer. Then, slowly, awareness returned—the stiffening of someone realizing where they were and who they were with, the careful opening of eyes.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Good morning."

Tenchi sat up, looking around his room as if seeing it for the first time. His face was puffy from sleep and tears, his hair a disaster of tangles and pillow-pressed patterns. But his eyes, when they found Sheldon's face, were clear.

"You stayed."

"I promised."

Something shifted in the boy's expression—not surprise exactly, but a kind of settling. The confirmation of something hoped for, now proven true.

"My back hurts," Tenchi said, with the sudden subject-changing honesty of childhood. "And I'm hungry."

"Then let's get you fed."


The kitchen was already occupied.

Katsuhito stood at the stove, stirring something in a pot, the smell of miso and rice filling the small space. He looked up as Sheldon and Tenchi appeared in the doorway—Sheldon moving stiffly, Tenchi trailing behind with a grip on his sleeve.

"Breakfast is almost ready," the old priest said. His eyes moved from Sheldon's face to Tenchi's, cataloguing what he saw. "Sit. Both of you."

They sat. Tenchi kept his hold on Sheldon's sleeve even at the table, as if afraid that releasing it would break some fragile connection. Sheldon didn't pull away.

Katsuhito served them—rice, soup, pickled vegetables, a small grilled fish for each. Then he sat across from them and began to eat in silence.

"Grandfather." Tenchi's voice was small. "I had a bad dream last night."

"I know."

"Sheldon-san stayed with me."

"I know that too."

The boy looked between them, trying to read the adult communication happening above his head. "Are you angry?"

"Why would I be angry?"

"Because I was loud. Because I woke everyone up."

Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "Tenchi. Look at me."

The boy met his grandfather's eyes with visible effort.

"Dreams come whether we want them to or not. They are not something to be ashamed of, and they are not something to apologize for." The old priest's voice was gentle but firm. "When bad dreams come, the only thing that matters is that someone is there to help you through them. Sheldon-san was there. That is good."

Tenchi's grip on Sheldon's sleeve tightened.

"But," Katsuhito continued, "you have school today. And Sheldon-san has work at the house. So we must eat, and get ready, and continue with the day. Life does not stop for dreams, even bad ones. Understood?"

"Understood."

"Good. Finish your breakfast."


The bus came at 8:27, as it always did.

Sheldon walked Tenchi to the top of the shrine steps, watching the boy descend with his backpack bouncing against his small frame. At the bottom, Tenchi turned and waved—a bigger wave than usual, more emphatic, holding until Sheldon waved back.

Then he was gone, swallowed by the yellow bus and the road and the ordinary rhythm of kindergarten Tuesdays.

Sheldon stood at the top of the steps for a long moment, looking down at the empty road. His body ached in ways he hadn't known it could ache—the accumulated cost of hours in one position, the debt of a sleepless night. But beneath the ache was something else. Something that felt like purpose.

*I kept my promise*, he thought. *That's what matters.*


Katsuhito found him on the engawa, drinking tea with hands that trembled slightly from exhaustion.

"You should rest," the old priest said, settling beside him.

"I should go to the house. Yamada is waiting."

"Yamada can wait. The roof will still be there tomorrow." Katsuhito poured himself tea from the pot Sheldon had prepared. "You've been awake since yesterday morning. The body has limits, even young ones."

*Young.* The word caught Sheldon's attention, as it always did. This body was young—thirty, according to the documents, but feeling younger still, full of energy and capability that his previous form had never possessed. Even exhausted, even aching, it functioned better than his old body had at its best.

"I'll rest after I check on the progress," he said. "Yamada said to bring tea at ten."

"I'll bring the tea. You'll sleep."

It wasn't a request. Sheldon recognized the tone—the same one Katsuhito used with Tenchi when negotiation was not an option.

"All right," he said. "A few hours."

"Good." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "What you did last night—staying with him—that was not a small thing."

"It felt like the only thing."

"Perhaps. But many people, faced with a crying child in the dark, choose differently. They call for someone else. They offer comfort from a distance. They do what is required and no more." The old priest's eyes found the great tree, as they often did. "You stayed until dawn. You held him while he slept. That is not 'the only thing.' That is everything."

Sheldon didn't know how to respond to that. The words sat between them, heavy with meaning he wasn't sure he understood.

"He chose you," Katsuhito continued. "Not me. Not his father. You. A stranger who arrived eight days ago." A pause. "Children see things clearly. They know who can be trusted with their fear."

"I'm not sure I deserve that trust."

"None of us are sure. But the trust is given anyway, and we must decide what to do with it." Katsuhito finished his tea and stood. "Sleep now. The house will wait. The boy will come home this afternoon, and he will need to see you rested and present. That is what matters."

He left Sheldon alone on the engawa, watching the morning light strengthen over the courtyard.


Sleep, when it came, was dreamless.

Sheldon lay down in the guest room—Nobuyuki's room, his room, the room where he'd woken to a child's cry just hours before—and let the exhaustion pull him under. No thoughts, no questions, no attempts to understand what was happening to him or why. Just darkness, and rest, and the slow repair of a body that had given everything it had.

He woke in the early afternoon to the sound of the wind in the trees and the distant rhythm of Yamada's hammer.

The house was waiting. The work was waiting. Life was continuing, as Katsuhito had said it would.

Sheldon rose, washed his face, and went to meet it.

#### Scene 9.B: The Afternoon

The house smelled like progress.

Sheldon arrived to find Yamada on the roof, methodically laying new underlayment where the old had rotted away. The roofer acknowledged his arrival with a grunt and a gesture toward the tea thermos Katsuhito had left on the engawa.

"Your priest brought the tea. Said you were sleeping."

"I was. I'm sorry I wasn't here this morning."

"Nothing to be sorry for." Yamada adjusted a section of material, his movements precise and unhurried. "A man who doesn't sleep is a man who makes mistakes. Mistakes cost money."

Sheldon poured himself tea and sat on the engawa, watching the work. The south side was taking shape now—the skeleton of the roof visible where tiles had been removed, new bones being added where old ones had failed. It was slow work, careful work, the kind that couldn't be rushed without consequences.

"The second beam is worse than I thought," Yamada said. "But not as bad as it could be. Another year, maybe two, and it would have gone. You're lucky you came when you did."

*Lucky.* The word sat strangely in Sheldon's mind. He wasn't sure luck had anything to do with how he'd arrived, or when, or why. But the timing—that, at least, seemed fortunate.

"How much longer for the south side?"

"Three more days, if weather holds. Then we start on the east."

Three days. Then more days. Then, eventually, a house that could be lived in. A home that was his own.

Sheldon finished his tea and went to the garden.


The work was good.

There was something meditative about pulling weeds, about clearing paths, about the slow transformation of neglected ground into something tended and cared for. Sheldon's hands found the rhythm easily now, moving without conscious direction, responding to the needs of the garden as if they'd always known how.

He worked until the shadows began to lengthen, until the sound of Yamada's hammer fell silent and the roofer descended for the day.

"Same time tomorrow," Yamada said, loading tools into his truck. "The beam work will take longer. Might need an extra pair of hands for the heavy lifting."

"I'll be here."

Yamada nodded and drove away, leaving Sheldon alone with the house and the garden and the approaching evening.

Time to go back.


The shrine was quiet when he arrived.

Too quiet—the particular silence of a place holding its breath, waiting for something. Sheldon climbed the steps with growing unease, his body still tired from the sleepless night but alert now, tuned to frequencies he couldn't name.

He found them on the engawa.

Katsuhito sat in his usual spot, carving something small from a block of wood. And there, pressed against the old priest's side with a book open in his lap, was Tenchi—home from school, changed out of his uniform, watching the path with eyes that tracked Sheldon's approach like radar.

The boy's face transformed when he saw Sheldon. Relief, joy, something desperate and glad all at once.

"Sheldon-san!"

He was up and running before Sheldon had fully reached the engawa, small body colliding with Sheldon's legs in a hug that had more force than a four-year-old should have been capable of.

"You came back," Tenchi said, the words muffled against Sheldon's work clothes. "You came back."

"I always come back." Sheldon crouched to meet the boy's eyes. "Remember? As far as I can see."

Tenchi's face was serious, searching Sheldon's expression for something—truth, maybe, or the evidence of promises kept. Whatever he found seemed to satisfy him, because after a long moment he nodded.

"Okay," he said. "Okay."


Dinner was different.

Not in what was served—rice, miso soup, grilled fish, the standard rotation of shrine meals—but in how they ate it. Tenchi sat closer to Sheldon than usual, their shoulders almost touching. He passed dishes without being asked, anticipated needs, maintained a constant low-level awareness of where Sheldon was in the room.

Katsuhito observed without comment, his eyes moving between them with the patient attention of someone cataloguing data.

"I drew a picture today," Tenchi announced midway through the meal. "At school. Sensei said it was good."

"What did you draw?"

"A house. With a garden. And people in front of it."

"Who were the people?"

Tenchi's face went pink. "Just... people. Me and Grandfather and..." He trailed off, suddenly fascinated by his rice bowl.

"And?" Sheldon prompted gently.

"And you." The words came out in a rush. "I put you in the picture too. Is that okay?"

Something shifted in Sheldon's chest—a warmth, a settling, a recognition of significance. "That's more than okay."

Tenchi beamed, the pinkness in his cheeks transforming from embarrassment to pleasure. "Sensei asked who everyone was. I said it was my family. Was that—is that wrong?"

The question hung in the air, weighted with meaning that a four-year-old couldn't fully understand but clearly felt. *Family.* The word that Tenchi had used, unprompted, to describe the picture he'd drawn.

"It's not wrong," Sheldon said carefully. "Family is... family is the people who take care of each other. The people who stay."

"You stay."

"I stay."

Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "Tenchi. What did Sensei say when you told her about your picture?"

"She smiled. She said it was a nice family." Tenchi's brow furrowed. "But then she looked... I don't know. Funny. Like she was thinking about something."

*A child with a grandfather, a weekend father, and a strange Black man he calls family.* Sheldon could imagine exactly what Suzuki-sensei had been thinking, the questions forming behind her professional smile.

"I'm sure she was just happy you drew something nice," Sheldon said.

"Maybe." Tenchi didn't sound convinced, but he let the subject drop, returning to his dinner with renewed focus.


Bath time came and went.

Sheldon waited in the main room while Tenchi bathed, listening to the splash of water and the boy's off-key humming. It was a different sound than it had been before the nightmare—lighter somehow, less fragile. As if something that had been wound too tight had finally been allowed to loosen.

When Tenchi emerged in his sleeping yukata, he didn't go straight to his room. Instead, he came to where Sheldon was sitting and stood there, small and clean and smelling like soap.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Yes?"

"Will you..." The boy hesitated, gathering courage. "Will you sit with me? Until I fall asleep? Like last night?"

The request was tentative, prepared for refusal. Sheldon understood—understood that asking for comfort was harder than receiving it unasked, that vulnerability was easier when it was accidental.

"Of course," he said. "Let me tell your grandfather."


Tenchi's room was different by lamplight.

Sheldon had only seen it in the dim glow of the nightlight, in the gray of dawn. Now, with the lamp burning steady, he could see the details: the small shelf of picture books, the worn stuffed animal (a rabbit, missing one ear) tucked in the corner of the futon, the drawing pinned to the wall that showed a house with a garden and three figures in front of it.

The picture from today. Tenchi must have kept it instead of throwing it away.

"That's us," Tenchi said, following Sheldon's gaze. "The tall one is you. See? I made your hair curly."

The figure in question was mostly a brown oval with spirals on top, but the intent was clear. "It's a good likeness."

"Sensei helped me with the hands. Hands are hard."

"They are."

Tenchi climbed into his futon, arranging himself with the particular fussiness of children at bedtime. The rabbit went under one arm. The blanket was pulled up to his chin. His eyes found Sheldon's face and stayed there.

"You don't have to stay all night," he said. "Just until I'm asleep. That's okay, right?"

"That's okay."

"And if I have a bad dream again—"

"I'll be here. Or I'll come. Either way, you won't be alone."

Tenchi nodded, accepting this. His eyes began to drift closed, then snapped open again.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Yes?"

"I'm glad you came to the shrine. I'm glad you're staying."

"I'm glad too, Tenchi."

The boy's eyes closed for good this time, his breathing slowly evening out into the rhythm of sleep. Sheldon sat beside the futon and watched him drift away, this small person who had somehow decided that a stranger was family, that a promise made was a promise that would be kept.

*Nine days*, he thought. *Nine days, and I have a family.*

He stayed until Tenchi was deeply asleep, then rose quietly and slipped from the room, leaving the lamp burning low against the dark.

#### Scene 9.C: Evening

The main room was quiet when Sheldon emerged from Tenchi's room.

Katsuhito sat at the low table, a cup of tea before him, the small wooden carving from earlier in his hands. He didn't look up as Sheldon entered, but something in his posture acknowledged the arrival.

"He's asleep," Sheldon said.

"I know. I heard him ask you to stay."

Sheldon settled across the table, accepting the tea Katsuhito poured for him. The warmth was welcome—the evening had turned cool, and the shrine's old construction didn't hold heat the way modern buildings might.

"He drew a picture today," Sheldon said. "At school. He told his teacher we were his family."

"I saw the picture. He showed me when he came home." Katsuhito set down his carving—a bird, Sheldon could see now, wings half-spread as if about to take flight. "He's never drawn me before. Not in four years of kindergarten."

The words landed with unexpected weight. Four years of pictures, and Katsuhito had never appeared in them. But now—now there was a house with three figures, pinned to a bedroom wall.

"What changed?" Sheldon asked.

"You did." The old priest's eyes met his. "Or rather—you made him believe that change was possible. That the people in his life might actually stay."

"I haven't done anything special."

"You kept a promise. You stayed through a nightmare. You came back when you said you would." Katsuhito picked up the bird again, turning it in his fingers. "For a child who has lost his mother and sees his father only two days a week, those are not small things. Those are everything."

The silence that followed was not uncomfortable. It was the silence of two people who had reached an understanding, who had moved past the need for constant words.

"The teacher may ask questions," Katsuhito said eventually. "Suzuki-sensei is young, but she cares about her students. She'll want to know who you are."

"What should I tell her?"

"The truth, as far as you know it. That you're a family friend. That you're restoring the Tsukino house. That you help care for Tenchi while his father works." A pause. "She doesn't need to know more than that. Not yet."

*Not yet.* The words implied a future where more would be known, where the careful story Sheldon had been telling would need to expand or deepen. But that future wasn't today.

"I understand."

"Good." Katsuhito stood, the bird carving still in his hand. "Get some rest. You look like you need it."

"I do." Sheldon managed a small smile. "What's the bird for?"

"Tenchi. For his birthday." The old priest examined his work with a critical eye. "Still needs finishing. Two more weeks should be enough."

Two weeks until Tenchi's birthday. April 24th. Another date to remember, another milestone in this life he was building day by day.

"Good night, Katsuhito-sensei."

"Good night, Tsukino-san."


The bath was brief and hot.

Sheldon soaked in the ofuro, letting the water work on muscles that still carried the tension of a sleepless night and a day of physical labor. His body was recovering—this new body, this young body that healed faster and hurt less than the one he remembered. But even it had limits, and those limits had been tested.

He thought about Tenchi's picture, pinned to the bedroom wall. Three figures in front of a house. A family, drawn by a child who had lost so much and was still brave enough to hope for more.

*Family is the people who take care of each other. The people who stay.*

He'd said that without thinking, the words coming from somewhere deeper than conscious thought. But they were true—true in a way that mattered. Blood made relatives. Choice made family. And Tenchi had chosen, with the clarity that only children possessed, to include Sheldon in that circle.

*I'll try to be worthy of it*, he thought. *Whatever that takes. However long it takes.*

The water cooled. He rose, dried himself, dressed in sleeping clothes, and went to bed.


Sleep came easier this time.

The exhaustion was still there, layered deep, but beneath it was something else—a settling, a grounding, the particular peace of knowing where you belonged and why you were there. Nine days since waking in the field. Nine days of learning names and faces, of building routines and relationships, of discovering what it meant to be Tsukino Sheldon in this place and time.

He dreamed of Dorothy.

Not the dream from before, with both mothers standing together. Just Dorothy this time, sitting in her kitchen in Atlanta, shelling peas into a bowl. She looked up when he entered, smiled, and said: *You're doing good, baby. You're doing real good.*

He woke to dawn light, the dream already fading, but the warmth of it remaining.


- "Still needs finishing. Two more weeks."

**Katsuhito's Revelation:**
- Tenchi had never drawn him in 4 years of kindergarten

#### Scene 10.A: Tenth Morning

The tenth morning came gentle and warm.

Sheldon woke with the echo of Dorothy's voice still resonating in his chest—*you're doing good, baby*—and lay still for a moment, letting the feeling settle. Outside the paper screens, birds were beginning their morning conversation, and the light filtering through carried the particular gold of a spring day promising sunshine.

He rose, dressed, and went to the kitchen.


The routine had become familiar.

Water from the pump (three pulls for good pressure). Rice from the bin. The particular sequence of movements that turned raw ingredients into breakfast—miso paste dissolved in dashi, vegetables sliced thin, fish laid out for grilling. His hands knew the work now, moving without conscious direction, finding their rhythm in the quiet morning kitchen.

*Ten days*, he thought, stirring the soup. *Ten days of mornings like this.*

The realization brought with it a strange vertigo—not unpleasant, just disorienting. A week and a half ago, he hadn't existed. He'd been dead, or something like it, his consciousness dissolved into whatever came after. And now he was here, making breakfast in a Japanese shrine, counting days like they were coins in a jar.

*Don't think too hard*, the internal voice suggested. *Just keep moving. The thinking comes later.*

He trusted the voice. He was learning when to trust it and when to question it. In the kitchen, at least, it was always right.


Tenchi appeared at seven, dressed in his kindergarten uniform.

He looked different this morning—not dramatically, but noticeably. Something in the way he moved, in the set of his shoulders. Less fragile. More grounded. The nightmare and its aftermath had changed something in him, had shifted some internal weight from one position to another.

"Good morning, Sheldon-san."

"Good morning. Did you sleep well?"

"I had a dream about frogs." Tenchi climbed onto his cushion at the table. "They were jumping on clouds. It was funny."

"Frogs on clouds sounds like a good dream."

"It was." The boy's smile was easy, unshadowed. "Better than the other kind."

*The other kind.* They both knew what he meant. But they didn't need to name it—not this morning, not when the clouds were full of frogs and the light was golden and breakfast was ready.

Katsuhito joined them a few minutes later, moving with the unhurried grace of someone who had spent decades mastering the art of morning. He surveyed the table—rice, soup, fish, pickles—and nodded once.

"You're getting better at the fish."

"I'm learning."

"So I see."

They ate in companionable silence, the three of them, the morning settling around them like a comfortable blanket. When Tenchi finished, he carried his dishes to the kitchen without being asked, then returned to collect his backpack.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Yes?"

"Will you wave when the bus leaves? From the top of the steps?"

"I always do."

"I know." Tenchi's smile widened. "But I like asking anyway."


The bus arrived at 8:27, precise as always.

Sheldon stood at the top of the shrine steps, watching Tenchi descend. The boy moved quickly now, confident on the familiar path, pausing only once to look back and wave. Sheldon waved in return—a big wave, the kind Tenchi had given him the day before—and watched until the yellow bus swallowed the small figure and carried it away.

"You could go down with him," Katsuhito said from somewhere behind him. "Stand at the stop. See him onto the bus."

"He didn't ask for that."

"No. He asked for the wave." The old priest came to stand beside him, looking out over the valley. "Children know what they need. Tenchi needs to know you're watching. That you're there when he leaves, and there when he returns."

"The anchor."

"Yes. The anchor." Katsuhito's eyes found the tree, as they always did. "He had one, once. His mother. She would stand on the engawa every morning and wave until he was out of sight. Then she would wave when he came home. She said it made her feel connected to him, even when they were apart."

Sheldon absorbed this. Another piece of the puzzle, another fragment of the family history he was slowly learning. Kiyone—Tenchi's mother, dead now almost two years—had waved from the engawa. Had been the anchor before anchoring became impossible.

"You're giving him back something he lost," Katsuhito continued. "Not the same thing—never the same—but something similar enough to matter."

"I'm not trying to replace her."

"No one could replace her. No one should try." The old priest turned to look at him directly. "But presence isn't replacement. Comfort isn't usurpation. You can be what you are without diminishing what she was."

The words settled something that Sheldon hadn't realized was unsettled. He'd been carrying a worry, somewhere beneath conscious thought—a fear that in taking this role, he was somehow erasing Kiyone's place in Tenchi's life. But Katsuhito was right. Presence and memory could coexist. The living and the dead could share space in a child's heart.

"Thank you," he said.

"Thank me by keeping him safe." Katsuhito began walking back toward the shrine. "The house is waiting. Yamada will need his tea."


The walk down the mountain was peaceful.

The forest was fully awake now, birds calling from the canopy, insects beginning their daily hum. The path was dappled with light and shadow, the morning sun filtering through branches that were thick with new spring growth.

Sheldon moved through it without hurrying, letting his body find its own pace. Ten days of this path had made it familiar—the rocks to step around, the roots to watch for, the places where the trail narrowed and the places where it opened onto brief clearings.

*This is mine now*, he thought. *This walk. This morning. This life.*

The Tsukino house appeared through the trees, and with it the sound of Yamada's truck pulling up. Day three of roof repair. Day ten of Sheldon's new existence. Another morning of building what needed to be built.

He quickened his pace. There was work to be done.

#### Scene 10.B: The Afternoon

Yamada was already on the roof when Sheldon arrived.

The roofer worked with the methodical patience of someone who understood that speed and quality rarely coexisted. Each movement was deliberate—testing a board before putting weight on it, examining a joint before driving a nail, pausing to assess before proceeding. It was craftsmanship in its purest form, and Sheldon found himself watching more than working.

"You're staring," Yamada said without looking down.

"I'm learning."

"Hmph." The sound might have been approval. "The beam work starts tomorrow. I'll need you up here for that."

"You said you needed extra hands."

"I need hands that follow directions. Can you follow directions?"

"Yes."

"Good. Ten o'clock. Don't be late, and don't wear anything you care about keeping clean."

Sheldon nodded, though Yamada couldn't see it, and returned to the garden.


The work was becoming familiar.

He'd cleared most of the obvious overgrowth now—the weeds that had claimed the paths, the vines that had wrapped themselves around the fence posts, the wild grass that had swallowed the vegetable beds. What remained was more subtle work: shaping, defining, preparing the ground for what would come next.

The stone path needed resetting. Several of the flat rocks had shifted over the years, creating uneven surfaces that pooled water and encouraged moss. Sheldon found a small pry bar among the tools Katsuhito had lent him and began the slow process of lifting, leveling, and replacing.

*This is meditation*, he thought, working a stubborn stone free from its bed of packed earth. *The same as sweeping. The same as cooking. Focus the hands, and the mind follows.*

The internal voice didn't comment. It rarely did during physical work—as if it understood that the body's wisdom was sufficient for these tasks, that its guidance was needed only when the mind threatened to complicate what should be simple.

By noon, a third of the path was reset. By two o'clock, half. By three, when Sheldon finally stopped and looked up at the sky, nearly two-thirds.

His back ached. His hands were dirty. He felt better than he had in—

*In this life*, he finished. *Better than I have in this life.*

Which was only ten days, but still.


The walk back to the shrine was unhurried.

Sheldon had learned to time his return for just before Tenchi's bus arrived—late enough to have accomplished real work, early enough to be present when the boy came home. It was a balance, a rhythm, one of the many small calibrations that made a household function.

He emerged from the forest to find Katsuhito on the engawa, the bird carving in his hands, the afternoon sun casting long shadows across the courtyard. The old priest looked up as Sheldon approached.

"The path?"

"Almost done. Tomorrow I'll finish it."

"And then?"

"The pond, I think. It needs clearing. And the maple still needs pruning."

Katsuhito nodded, returning to his carving. The bird was taking shape now—Sheldon could see the curve of its breast, the suggestion of folded wings, the way the wood grain followed the line of its body. It would be beautiful when it was finished.

"Yamada wants me on the roof tomorrow," Sheldon said. "For the beam work."

"He must trust you. He doesn't usually let clients near his projects."

"He said I follow directions."

"That's high praise, from Yamada-san." The knife paused its work. "He fired his last apprentice for asking too many questions."

"I'll try to ask the right amount."

"That would be wise."


The bus arrived at 2:45.

Sheldon was at the top of the steps when it appeared around the bend in the road, yellow against the green of the forest. He watched it stop, watched the small figure emerge, watched Tenchi begin his climb with the particular energy of a child who knew someone was waiting.

The wave came halfway up—a big wave, enthusiastic, both arms if Tenchi could have managed it without dropping his backpack. Sheldon waved back, and something settled in his chest. A rightness. A completion.

"You're dirty," Tenchi announced when he reached the top, surveying Sheldon's work clothes with the critical eye of a four-year-old.

"I was working."

"On the garden?"

"On the path. The stones needed fixing."

Tenchi considered this. "Can I help next time?"

"If you want to. It's hard work."

"I like hard work." The boy straightened with exaggerated pride. "Grandfather says I'm a good helper."

"Then I'd be glad to have you."


Dinner was simple.

Rice, miso soup, grilled vegetables, the last of the pickled plum from the jar Katsuhito's wife had prepared years ago. Sheldon made a mental note to learn how to make umeboshi himself—the supply wouldn't last forever, and it was becoming clear that some things were worth preserving.

"Sensei asked about you today," Tenchi said midway through the meal.

Sheldon's chopsticks paused. "Oh?"

"She asked if you were my uncle." The boy's face was thoughtful. "I said you weren't. I said you were... I said you were Sheldon-san."

"That's accurate."

"She wanted to know more. I said you lived at the shrine and helped with things." Tenchi looked at Katsuhito, then back at Sheldon. "Was that okay to say?"

"That was fine," Katsuhito answered before Sheldon could. "Suzuki-sensei is curious because she cares about her students. It's natural to want to know about the people in a child's life."

"She said maybe she'd meet you sometime." Tenchi's eyes were bright with something—excitement, maybe, or anxiety. "Would that be okay?"

Sheldon thought about Suzuki-sensei, the young teacher he'd never met, asking questions about the stranger who had appeared in her student's drawings and conversations. It was inevitable, really. A child didn't suddenly start talking about a new family member without the adults around him taking notice.

"If she wants to meet me, I'd be happy to talk with her."

Tenchi relaxed visibly. "Good. I told her you were nice."

"That was kind of you."

"It's true." The boy returned to his rice with the matter-of-fact certainty of childhood. "You're the nicest person I know. After Grandfather."

Katsuhito's lips twitched. "I'm honored to remain in first place."

"You're old," Tenchi explained. "Old people are supposed to be nice. Sheldon-san is young, so it's more special."

Sheldon found himself laughing—a genuine laugh, the kind that came from somewhere deep and surprised him with its presence. Katsuhito's eyes crinkled with amusement, and Tenchi beamed at having made both adults happy.

*This*, Sheldon thought. *This is what I was brought here for. Whatever else happens, this moment is enough.*


The evening settled into familiar patterns.

Bath, stories, the ritual of settling Tenchi for sleep. The boy didn't ask Sheldon to stay tonight—didn't need to, perhaps, or was testing whether the offer still stood without asking. Sheldon waited in the hallway until Tenchi's breathing evened out, then returned to the main room.

Katsuhito was there, tea poured, the bird carving set aside for the night.

"He's doing better," the old priest observed.

"He is."

"The nightmares may return. They often do, for children who've lost a parent. But having someone present—someone consistent—that helps."

"I'll be here."

"I know." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "That's why I said it."

They sat in comfortable silence, two men who had found a balance without naming it. Outside, the night deepened, and somewhere in the distance an owl called its question to the dark.

"Ten days," Sheldon said finally.

"Ten days."

"It feels longer. And shorter. Both at once."

"That's how it always feels," Katsuhito said. "When you're building something that matters."

#### Scene 10.C: Evening

The owl called again, closer this time.

Sheldon listened to it from the main room, his tea growing cold in his hands. The sound was becoming familiar—one of the shrine's nighttime voices, as regular as the settling of wood and the whisper of wind through the great tree's branches.

"You should sleep," Katsuhito said. "Tomorrow will be long."

"The beam work."

"Yes. Yamada-san doesn't take breaks when he's doing structural repairs. He says stopping invites mistakes."

Sheldon thought about that—the philosophy of continuous effort, of maintaining momentum until a task was complete. It made a certain kind of sense. Breaking focus cost something. Returning to work after rest meant rebuilding understanding, re-finding the rhythm that had been temporarily lost.

"I'll be ready," he said.

"I know you will." Katsuhito finished his own tea and rose. "Tenchi will be disappointed to miss it. He wanted to help."

"Tomorrow is a school day."

"I told him that. He suggested skipping." The old priest's eyes held a glint of amusement. "I declined the suggestion."

"Probably wise."

"Probably." Katsuhito moved toward the hallway. "Good night, Tsukino-san."

"Good night, Katsuhito-sensei."


The bath was brief, efficient.

Sheldon soaked just long enough to loosen his muscles, then dried and dressed and went to the guest room. His body was tired in a good way—the kind of tired that came from honest labor, from hours of lifting and placing and moving through physical space.

He thought about the stone path, nearly finished now. He thought about the beam waiting at the Tsukino house, ready to be lifted and placed. He thought about Tenchi, asleep in his room with the one-eared rabbit and the family picture on the wall.

*Ten days complete*, he thought. *Day eleven begins tomorrow.*

It was a small milestone. Ten days wasn't a month, wasn't a season, wasn't any of the meaningful markers that people used to measure time. But it felt significant anyway—a checkpoint, a proof of concept, evidence that this life was real and continuing and his.

*I'm still here*, he thought. *I'm still becoming.*

Sleep came easily, carrying him down into darkness. This time, he didn't dream—or if he did, the dreams dissolved before waking, leaving nothing behind but the vague sense of peace.

#### Scene 11.A: Eleventh Morning

The eleventh morning came with purpose.

Sheldon woke knowing what the day held—beam work, roof work, the kind of physical labor that would test the limits of this new body in ways the garden hadn't. He rose before dawn, dressed in his oldest clothes (per Yamada's instructions), and went to the kitchen.

Breakfast was simple and substantial: extra rice, extra fish, the kind of meal that would sustain hard work. Tenchi appeared at seven, still rubbing sleep from his eyes, disappointed all over again that he couldn't skip school to help.

"Next time," Sheldon said.

"You always say that."

"Because it's always true. There's always a next time."

Tenchi considered this logic, found it wanting, but accepted it anyway. He ate his breakfast with the resignation of a child who knew some battles weren't worth fighting.

"Be careful on the roof," he said as Sheldon prepared to leave. "Don't fall."

"I won't fall."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

The boy's eyes held his for a long moment—testing, trusting, confirming. Then he nodded. "Okay. I'll see you when I get home."

"I'll be here."


The Tsukino house looked different in the morning light.

Scaffolding had appeared along the south side—Yamada's work from yesterday afternoon, Sheldon realized, erected after he'd left. The structure was solid, professional, the kind of temporary construction that spoke of someone who understood safety wasn't optional.

Yamada was already there, arranging tools on the scaffolding platform. He looked up as Sheldon approached.

"Good. You're early."

"You said ten. It's nine-thirty."

"Early is good. Late is fired." The roofer descended from the scaffolding and walked to where the replacement beam lay against the house. "Here's what we're doing. This beam—" He patted the timber. "—goes up there." He pointed to a gap in the roof structure where the old beam had been removed. "We lift it, we position it, we secure it. Simple."

"That doesn't look simple."

"It's not. But the concept is." Yamada fixed him with a measuring stare. "You'll be on the scaffold. I'll be inside, guiding the beam into place from below. Your job is to keep it steady, keep it level, and do exactly what I tell you. Nothing more, nothing less."

"I understand."

"Do you?" The question wasn't rhetorical. "Because if you don't, that beam comes down on my head. Or yours. Or it cracks, and I have to source a new one, which costs money and time I don't have."

"I understand."

Yamada studied him for another moment, then nodded. "Good. Let's get you up there."


The scaffold was higher than it looked from the ground.

Not dangerously high—maybe three meters—but enough to make the body aware of its position in space, to awaken some primal part of the brain that remembered when heights meant predators and falling meant death. Sheldon gripped the railing and made himself breathe.

"First time on a scaffold?" Yamada called up.

"First time since college."

"Physics lab?"

"Something like that." The lie came easily—close enough to truth, far enough from explanation. "I'm fine. Just getting oriented."

"Take your time. We don't start until you're ready."

It was an unexpected kindness, delivered without sentiment. Yamada wasn't coddling him—the roofer didn't coddle anyone—but he understood that rushing led to mistakes, and mistakes led to consequences none of them wanted.

Sheldon took a breath, then another, and felt his body settle into the new reality of elevated ground. His hands found their grip on the beam that served as the platform's main support. His feet spread for balance. His center of gravity lowered instinctively.

*This body knows things*, he thought. *Things I never learned. Things I couldn't have learned.*

"Ready," he said.


The lift was controlled chaos.

Yamada had rigged a system of ropes and pulleys that distributed the beam's weight across multiple anchor points. Sheldon's job was to guide the end nearest him, keeping it level as the timber rose through the gap in the roof structure and into position.

"Steady," Yamada called from below. "Keep it level. Two more inches... there. Hold."

Sheldon held. His arms burned with the effort—the beam wasn't impossibly heavy, but holding anything at an awkward angle for extended periods was its own kind of trial. Sweat ran down his face, stinging his eyes. He blinked it away and kept his grip.

"Rotating... now."

The beam turned in his hands, guided by Yamada's movements below. Sheldon compensated, shifting his weight, maintaining the level despite the change in orientation.

"Good. Now lower—slowly—into the cradle."

The cradle was a notch cut into the support structure, waiting to receive the beam's end. Sheldon lowered his end inch by inch, watching it settle into position with the satisfaction of a puzzle piece finding its home.

"Hold there." Yamada's voice was tight with concentration. "I'm securing the other end."

The sound of a hammer echoed through the structure—once, twice, three times. Then silence.

"You can let go now."

Sheldon released his grip, and the beam stayed where it was, solid and secure, a new bone in the house's skeleton.

"Good work," Yamada said, emerging from beneath the scaffolding. "Better than I expected."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. You did the work." The roofer wiped his forehead with a rag. "Tea break. Then we do the bracing."


They sat on the engawa—cleared of debris now, solid enough to hold their weight—and drank tea from the thermos Sheldon had brought.

"You've done this before," Yamada said. It wasn't a question.

"No. Not this exactly."

"Something like it. The way you moved up there—that's not beginner's luck. That's trained response."

Sheldon thought about how to answer. The truth was impossible: *I woke up eleven days ago in a body that knows things I never learned, with skills I never practiced, in a life I didn't choose.* No one would believe that. No one should believe that.

"I learn fast," he said instead. "And I had good teachers."

"Must have." Yamada finished his tea and set down the cup. "Whoever they were, thank them if you see them again."

*Dorothy*, Sheldon thought. *Thank Dorothy.* But Dorothy had never taught him beam work, had never shown him how to hold weight at height, had never trained his body to respond to the demands of construction. Whatever was in him now—whatever had been given—it went beyond anything his grandmother could have provided.

"I will," he said. "If I see them."


The bracing took another two hours.

Cross-supports, angled pieces that locked the beam into place and distributed its load across the surrounding structure. Sheldon worked under Yamada's direction, holding pieces steady while the roofer drove nails, adjusting positions when measurements demanded it.

By the time they finished, the south side of the roof was structurally sound. Not complete—tiles still needed laying, underlayment still needed finishing—but the skeleton was whole again. The house could bear its own weight.

"Tomorrow, we start on the east," Yamada said, climbing down from the scaffolding. "The damage there is less severe. Should go faster."

"What about the path?"

"Your path?" The roofer shrugged. "Finish it if you want. The afternoon is yours. I have other clients to visit."

He packed his tools, loaded them into the truck, and drove away with a wave that was more acknowledgment than farewell. Sheldon stood in the yard, looking up at the work they'd done, feeling the good ache of muscles that had been used well.

*The house is healing*, he thought. *Piece by piece. Day by day.*

Just like him.

#### Scene 11.B: The Afternoon

The stone path wanted finishing.

Sheldon ate the bento Katsuhito had prepared—rice balls, pickled vegetables, a few slices of tamagoyaki—sitting on the newly-solid engawa with his back against the house. His arms still ached from the beam work, but it was a good ache, the kind that meant something had been accomplished.

When the food was gone, he returned to the path.

The remaining third was the most challenging section—the stones here had shifted the most, some tilted nearly vertical, others buried so deep they'd become more foundation than surface. Sheldon worked methodically, prying each stone free, examining the earth beneath, relaying gravel where drainage demanded it, resetting each piece in its proper position.

The work was slower than yesterday's. His body was tired, his focus slightly frayed from the morning's intensity. But the path didn't care about his fatigue. The path only cared about being done right.

By three o'clock, the last stone clicked into place.


He stood at the edge of the garden and looked at what he'd accomplished.

The path wound from the gate through the overgrown beds, around the choked pond, past the maple tree to the engawa. It wasn't perfectly straight—stone paths never were—but it was level now, stable, each piece locked against its neighbors in a pattern that would hold for years.

*I made this*, he thought. *Not with special powers or mysterious gifts. Just hands and time and patience.*

The thought brought something unexpected—a kind of pride he hadn't felt in years. Decades, maybe. His work at the university had been important, had pushed boundaries, had contributed to human knowledge. But it had always been abstract, theoretical, removed from the physical world by layers of mathematics and instrumentation.

This was different. This was stone and earth and sweat. This was something he could stand on.

*Dorothy would be proud*, he thought. *She always said real work leaves calluses.*

He looked at his hands. The calluses were forming.


The walk back to the shrine was peaceful.

Sheldon moved through the forest without hurrying, letting his body find its own rhythm after the day's labor. Birds called overhead. The afternoon light filtered golden through the canopy. Somewhere in the distance, a woodpecker drummed its persistent message.

*Eleven days*, he thought. *Eleven days of mornings and afternoons and evenings. Eleven days of becoming.*

He'd lost count somewhere around day five or six—the days had started to blur together, one flowing into the next without the sharp boundaries that novelty provided. But now, looking back, he could trace the arc of his transformation. From the field to the bus to the steps. From stranger to guest to something approaching family. From confusion to acceptance to this—whatever this was.

*Purpose*, maybe. *Direction. A reason to keep going.*

The shrine appeared through the trees, and with it the sound of a child's voice.

"Sheldon-san!"

Tenchi was running toward him before Sheldon had fully emerged from the forest, small legs pumping, face flushed with the urgency of reunion.

"You didn't fall!"

"I promised I wouldn't."

"I know, but—" The boy crashed into Sheldon's legs, arms wrapping tight. "I worried anyway."

Sheldon crouched to meet his eyes. "Worrying is okay. It means you care. But I kept my promise, didn't I?"

"Yeah." Tenchi's smile was watery but real. "You always do."


Dinner was celebration.

Not formally—there were no special dishes, no announced occasion—but the mood was lighter than usual, buoyed by the sense of accomplishment that hung in the air. Sheldon told them about the beam work, about Yamada's system of ropes and pulleys, about the moment the timber had settled into its cradle.

"So the house is fixed?" Tenchi asked.

"Part of it. The bones are good now. The rest is just... skin."

"Houses have skin?"

"Tiles. Walls. The parts you can see." Sheldon shaped the idea with his hands, building an invisible house in the air between them. "The bones hold everything up. The skin keeps the weather out. You need both."

Tenchi considered this anatomy lesson with the seriousness it deserved. "What about the heart?"

"What do you mean?"

"Houses have bones and skin. Do they have hearts?"

Sheldon thought about the Tsukino house—empty for four years, waiting for someone to bring it back to life. "Maybe the people who live in them are the heart. A house without people is just... bones and skin. It needs someone inside to make it alive."

"Then you'll be the heart," Tenchi said, as if this were obvious. "When you move in. You'll make it alive."

Something shifted in Sheldon's chest. "I hope so."

"You will." The boy's confidence was absolute. "You make everything alive. That's what you do."


The evening settled into familiar patterns.

Bath, stories, the slow descent into sleep. Tenchi didn't ask Sheldon to stay tonight—three nights now without the request, the pattern becoming established. The boy fell asleep with the one-eared rabbit tucked under his arm and the family picture watching from the wall.

Sheldon waited until the breathing evened, then slipped from the room.

Katsuhito was on the engawa, the bird carving in his hands, the evening dark and quiet around him. He didn't look up as Sheldon settled beside him.

"The path is finished," Sheldon said.

"I know. Tenchi told me you didn't fall."

"He was worried."

"He worries about everyone he loves." The old priest's knife moved in small, precise strokes. "It's how he shows it."

Sheldon watched the bird take shape—the curve of a wing emerging from the wood, feathers suggested rather than defined. "How long have you been carving?"

"Since I was younger than Tenchi." A pause that held more than the words suggested. "It helps me think. Keeps the hands busy while the mind works."

"What are you thinking about?"

Katsuhito's knife stilled. "Many things. The past. The future. The stranger who arrived eleven days ago and is no longer a stranger."

"Am I that different from when I arrived?"

"You're the same person. But you're more... present now. Less like someone watching their life and more like someone living it."

The observation landed with unexpected accuracy. Sheldon had felt that shift, had noticed himself settling into his days with increasing comfort. But he hadn't known it was visible from outside.

"Is that good?"

"It's healthy." The knife resumed its work. "A man who watches his life eventually stops living it. A man who lives his life eventually forgets he was ever watching."

*Forget*, Sheldon thought. *Will I forget? Will this become so normal that I forget it ever wasn't?*

Maybe. Maybe that was what healing looked like.

"Good night, Katsuhito-sensei."

"Good night, Tsukino-san."

#### Scene 11.C: Evening

The night air carried the smell of cedar and distant rain.

Sheldon sat with his cooling tea, watching the last light fade from the sky above the shrine. Katsuhito had gone inside, the bird carving tucked away for another day, leaving Sheldon alone with the darkness and his thoughts.

*A man who lives his life eventually forgets he was ever watching.*

The words circled in his mind, settling into place alongside all the other wisdom the old priest had offered over eleven days. Katsuhito spoke in fragments, in observations, in questions that were really answers. It was a teaching style, Sheldon realized—not lecturing, but pointing. Showing the way without demanding it be followed.

*I'm learning*, he thought. *Not just cooking, not just carpentry. I'm learning how to be here.*

The great tree stood silent in the darkness, its presence felt rather than seen. Sheldon's eyes found it anyway—that automatic draw, that compass-needle pull toward something he couldn't name. Whatever it was, it felt like home now. Whatever it meant, it had become part of him.


The bath was brief and necessary.

His muscles protested the day's labor—beam work and stone work, arms and back and legs all contributing to the chorus of complaint. But it was a good protest, the kind that meant progress had been made. The house was stronger now. The path was complete. Day by day, piece by piece, something was being built.

He dried off and dressed for sleep, the routine automatic now, requiring no conscious thought. The guest room waited, familiar, almost his own.

*Almost*, he thought. *Soon, the Tsukino house will be ready. Soon, I'll have a place that's truly mine.*

But not tonight. Tonight, he belonged here, in this room that had held Nobuyuki's childhood and now held Sheldon's present. Tonight, he was where he needed to be.


Sleep came with a dream.

Not Dorothy this time, not the mothers blended together, but something else—something harder to hold. He stood in a field of white flowers under a sky that held too many stars, and someone was speaking to him in a language he almost understood. A voice like bells, like water, like the space between heartbeats.

*You are doing well*, the voice said. *You are becoming what you need to be.*

He tried to turn, to see the speaker, but the dream dissolved before he could move. The stars scattered. The flowers faded. The voice became silence.

He woke with the echo of it still resonating in his chest, not sure if he'd dreamed or remembered or glimpsed something real.

The dawn light was beginning to touch the paper screens.

Day twelve had begun.


- Day 9: Dorothy alone (kitchen, "doing good")
- Day 11: Unknown speaker (white flowers, stars)

**Possible Foreshadowing:**

#### Scene 12.A: Twelfth Morning

The twelfth morning carried the echo of stars.

Sheldon woke with the dream still clinging to him—white flowers, a voice like bells, the sense of being seen by something vast and kind. It faded as dreams did, dissolving in the light of the paper screens, but the feeling remained. A warmth in his chest. A certainty he couldn't explain.

*You are becoming what you need to be.*

He didn't know what that meant. He wasn't sure he wanted to know. But the words felt true in a way that bypassed logic, settling into his bones like something that had always been there, waiting to be remembered.

He rose and went to the kitchen.


Breakfast was routine now.

Rice from the bin, water from the pump, the sequence of movements that had become second nature. Sheldon worked without conscious thought, his hands knowing what his mind didn't need to direct. The soup simmered. The fish grilled. The pickles arranged themselves on their small plates.

*Twelve days*, he thought. *Twelve days of mornings like this.*

It was Friday. Tomorrow would be Saturday—Nobuyuki's day to visit. The rhythm of the week was beginning to make sense, each day carrying its own weight and meaning in the pattern of shrine life.

Tenchi appeared at seven, already dressed, vibrating with the particular energy of a child approaching the weekend.

"Tomorrow Father comes!"

"I know."

"Will you cook something special? He likes your food better than Grandfather's." The boy's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell Grandfather I said that."

"Your secret is safe."

They shared a smile—the kind of small conspiracy that built bonds without either party naming it.


The walk to the house was peaceful.

Sheldon moved through the forest with the ease of familiarity, his feet finding the path without conscious attention. Birds called overhead. The morning light filtered golden through the canopy. Somewhere in the distance, a truck engine rumbled—Yamada, probably, arriving at the house.

The dream lingered at the edges of his awareness, not demanding attention but present, like a note held too long after a chord had resolved. He let it be there without examining it. Some things weren't meant to be understood. Some things were only meant to be felt.

The house emerged through the trees, and with it the sight of Yamada's truck already parked in the yard. The roofer stood on the scaffolding, surveying the east side with professional attention.

"You're late," Yamada called down.

Sheldon checked his watch. "It's eight-thirty."

"I said the east side would go faster. That means earlier starts." But there was no real criticism in the words—just the gruff manner that was Yamada's default mode. "Come up. I want to show you something."


The east side was different.

Where the south had been damaged by water infiltration—years of slow rot spreading from a single point of failure—the east showed the marks of mechanical stress. Tiles had cracked along fault lines. Support structures had shifted under wind load. The damage was visible but contained, the kind of thing that came from normal wear rather than neglect.

"See this?" Yamada pointed to a beam that had bowed slightly under pressure. "Not rot. Just age. The wood dried out, lost its flexibility. Started to bend instead of flex."

Sheldon examined the beam, running his hand along its surface. The grain was tight, the wood still solid despite its deformation.

"Can it be straightened?"

"No. But it can be supported." Yamada moved to the next section. "We sister a new beam alongside it, transfer the load gradually, let the old one rest. It'll hold another fifty years that way."

"Sister?"

"Construction term. You attach a new piece alongside the damaged one, bolt them together, let them share the weight." The roofer's eyes held a glint of something—approval, maybe, or the satisfaction of teaching. "Like having a partner help you carry something heavy. Neither one could manage alone, but together they handle it fine."

*Like having a partner*, Sheldon thought. The metaphor landed somewhere unexpected, somewhere that had nothing to do with beams or construction.


The morning passed in focused work.

Yamada had prepared the sistering beams in advance—cut to length, pre-drilled for bolts, ready to be fitted into place. Sheldon's job was to hold each beam steady while Yamada drove the hardware home, maintaining pressure and position while the roofer worked with systematic precision.

It was easier than yesterday's beam lift. The sistering beams were smaller, lighter, more manageable at height. But the work still demanded concentration, still required the kind of continuous attention that left no room for wandering thoughts.

By noon, three beams had been reinforced.

"Good progress," Yamada said, climbing down from the scaffolding. "The tiles can go up tomorrow. Maybe Sunday, if the weather holds."

"That fast?"

"I told you the east side was less severe." The roofer pulled a cloth from his pocket and wiped his hands. "The south was the real work. This is just finishing."

*Finishing.* The word carried more weight than Yamada intended. The roof was almost done. The house was almost ready. Sheldon's temporary residence at the shrine was approaching its end.

"How much longer until I can move in?"

Yamada considered the question with the same precision he applied to his work. "Tiles go up this weekend. Flashing and sealing, maybe three more days. Then you'll need to reconnect utilities—water, electric. A week, maybe ten days, if you push."

A week. Ten days at most. And then the Tsukino house would be his.

"Thank you," Sheldon said. "For everything."

"Thank me when the bill is paid." But Yamada's voice held no hardness. "You've been a good client, Tsukino-san. Better than most. I'll tell people that, if anyone asks."

#### Scene 12.B: The Afternoon

The pond wanted attention.

With the stone path complete and Yamada handling the roof, Sheldon had run out of excuses to avoid the water feature. It had been lurking at the edge of his awareness since his first visit—a clouded mirror of neglect, its edges lost in overgrowth, its surface obscured by years of fallen leaves and accumulated debris.

He stood at its edge and assessed the work ahead.

The pond was larger than it had first appeared—perhaps three meters across, roughly oval, fed by what looked like a natural spring that seeped through rocks at one end. The water itself was dark with tannins and organic matter, but beneath the murk he could glimpse the suggestion of stone sides, carefully laid in some previous generation.

*Someone built this*, he thought. *Someone cared about it enough to make it beautiful.*

He found a long-handled net among the garden tools and began to skim.


The work was meditative in its way.

Leaves came up in waterlogged clumps, heavy and dark, releasing the smell of decay as they left the water. Branches followed, some of them substantial—fallen from the maple tree that overhung one edge, or blown in from the surrounding forest. Sheldon worked methodically, section by section, watching the water gradually clear.

By mid-afternoon, he could see the bottom.

Stones, as he'd suspected—flat river rocks laid in overlapping patterns, creating a mosaic that must have been striking when the pond was maintained. Some had shifted over the years, creating gaps where silt had accumulated, but the underlying structure was sound. A few hours of work, maybe a day, and it would be beautiful again.

*The house is healing*, he thought. *The garden is healing. Even the water is coming back to life.*

It felt like a metaphor for something larger, but he didn't examine it too closely. Sometimes it was enough to do the work and let the meaning take care of itself.


The walk back to the shrine was slower than usual.

Sheldon's clothes were wet from pond work, his arms tired from the repetitive motion of netting and lifting. But beneath the fatigue was satisfaction—the particular pleasure of seeing progress, of watching neglect transform into order.

He emerged from the forest to find the shrine already preparing for evening. Katsuhito was on the engawa, working on the bird carving. Tenchi was somewhere inside, audible through the open doors—humming to himself, the sound of a child at peace with his world.

"The pond?" Katsuhito asked without looking up.

"Getting there. I cleared the surface. Tomorrow I'll work on the edges."

"The pond was my wife's favorite place." The old priest's voice was matter-of-fact, carrying the weight of memory without drowning in it. "She would sit there for hours, watching the reflections."

"I didn't know."

"How could you? She died before you came here. Before Tenchi was born, even." The knife paused its work. "Her name was Itsuki. She was the one who planted the maple tree."

Sheldon absorbed this new piece of the shrine's history. Another layer, another life that had touched this place and left its mark. Itsuki, who loved the pond. Kiyone, who waved from the engawa. The women who had shaped this family, present now only in the spaces they'd left behind.

"I'll take good care of it," he said. "The pond."

"I know you will."


Dinner was focused on tomorrow.

Tenchi couldn't stop talking about his father's visit—what they would do, where they would go, what Sheldon should cook. The boy's excitement was infectious, filling the room with energy that made even the simple meal feel like celebration.

"Father likes fish," Tenchi announced. "But not the way Grandfather makes it. He likes it with the sauce you made last time."

"The teriyaki?"

"Yes! That one!" The boy's eyes went wide with remembered pleasure. "Can you make it again? Please?"

"I can make it again."

"And rice. And vegetables. And—" Tenchi's list continued, growing more elaborate with each addition, until Katsuhito gently intervened.

"Your father is coming for one meal, Tenchi, not a week."

"But Sheldon-san can make everything. He's the best cook."

"Even the best cook needs time." The old priest's eyes found Sheldon's across the table. "Though I admit, the teriyaki was excellent."

"High praise," Sheldon said.

"Deserved praise. There's a difference."


The evening settled into familiar patterns.

Bath, stories, the ritual of settling Tenchi for sleep. The boy was too excited to drift off easily, his mind still racing with tomorrow's possibilities, but eventually the rhythm of routine overcame the buzz of anticipation.

Sheldon waited in the hallway until the breathing evened, then returned to the main room.

Katsuhito wasn't there. The engawa was empty, the bird carving set aside. Sheldon poured himself tea and sat alone, listening to the sounds of the shrine at night—the settling of wood, the whisper of wind, the distant hoot of the owl that had become a familiar voice.

*A week*, he thought. *Maybe ten days. And then I'll have a home of my own.*

The thought brought mixed feelings. The Tsukino house was what he'd been working toward—a place that was his, a foundation for the life he was building. But leaving the shrine meant leaving this, too. These evenings. These routines. The particular peace of nights spent in Nobuyuki's childhood room.

*I'm not leaving*, he reminded himself. *I'm just... relocating. The shrine will still be here. Tenchi will still need me. Nothing that matters will change.*

But change was coming anyway. He could feel it in the approaching deadline, in the tiles that would go up tomorrow, in the countdown toward something new.

*That's what living is*, he thought. *One change after another, handled as they come.*

He finished his tea and went to bed.


Sleep came without dreams.

Or if there were dreams, they didn't survive the crossing into waking. Sheldon rose to Saturday morning with a clear mind and the knowledge that Nobuyuki was coming, that teriyaki was expected, and that somewhere in the village Yamada was preparing to finish a roof.

Day thirteen had begun.


- Katsuhito agreed it was "excellent"
- "Deserved praise. There's a difference."

**Move-In Mixed Feelings:**

- Satisfaction at progress
- Reluctance to leave shrine routines
- "I'm not leaving. I'm just relocating."

#### Scene 13.A: Thirteenth Morning

The thirteenth morning belonged to anticipation.

Sheldon woke to the sound of small feet padding past his door—Tenchi, already up, already vibrating with the energy of a day he'd been counting toward since Monday. The boy's excitement had been building all week, a steady crescendo that would peak sometime today when his father's car appeared on the road below.

*Saturday*, Sheldon thought. *Nobuyuki's day.*

He rose and went to the kitchen, knowing the morning's rhythm would be different but not sure exactly how.


Tenchi was at the table when Sheldon arrived, still in sleeping clothes, watching the door with the intensity of a cat at a mouse hole.

"He's not coming yet," Sheldon said gently. "It's not even six."

"I know." But the boy didn't move, didn't look away from the door. "I just want to be ready."

"You're in your pajamas."

"I'll change when I hear the car."

There was no arguing with that kind of logic—the logic of a child's heart, immune to practical considerations. Sheldon let it be and started breakfast.


The meal was quieter than usual.

Katsuhito emerged at his customary time, assessed the situation with a glance, and said nothing about Tenchi's vigil. The three of them ate in a silence punctuated only by Tenchi's occasional glances toward the door, each one carrying the same disappointed hope.

"He usually arrives around noon," Katsuhito said, more to Sheldon than to Tenchi. "The morning trains from the city."

"I know," Tenchi said. "But sometimes he comes early. Sometimes he takes the night train."

"Has he ever taken the night train?"

"Not yet." The boy's jaw set with stubborn optimism. "But he might."

Sheldon exchanged a look with Katsuhito—the kind of look adults shared over the heads of children, communicating volumes in a single glance. *Let him hope. Let him have this.*


The morning passed in preparations.

Sheldon cleaned the kitchen twice, swept the engawa, made sure the guest room—his room, Nobuyuki's room—was presentable for its original occupant. He found himself straightening things that didn't need straightening, adjusting arrangements that were already fine.

"You're nervous," Katsuhito observed, finding him repositioning cushions for the third time.

"I want to make a good impression."

"You already have. Last week, remember?"

"Last week he was assessing me. This week he's... checking." Sheldon set down the cushion. "Making sure the first impression wasn't a fluke."

"Is that what you think he's doing?"

"Isn't it?"

Katsuhito considered this for a moment. "Perhaps. But consider: he's also checking on his son. His father. His home. You're part of that now, but you're not the whole of it."

The words helped, a little. Sheldon was part of the pattern now, not the center of attention. Whatever assessment Nobuyuki was conducting, it was broader than just one strange American who had appeared at his childhood shrine.


The teriyaki demanded attention.

Sheldon had planned the meal carefully—fish from Ito-san's store, purchased yesterday with this dinner in mind. The marinade needed time to work, the sauce needed slow reduction, the vegetables needed proper preparation. He began at ten, giving himself two hours before the expected arrival.

The work was calming. It always was. His hands found the rhythm of cooking like a musician finding familiar keys—automatic, confident, guided by something deeper than conscious thought.

*Mirin, soy sauce, a touch of sake, a little sugar.* The marinade came together without recipe, without measurement, the proportions emerging from somewhere inside that knew what they should be.

*Supreme Chef*, he thought. The name he'd given the ability—or the gift, or whatever it was. Still manifesting, still growing, still surprising him with what it could do.

He scored the fish in careful parallel lines, laid it in the marinade, covered the dish, and set it aside. Two hours. That would be enough.


The car appeared at eleven-thirty.

Tenchi heard it first—his vigil had never really ended, despite his grandfather's attempts to distract him—and was out the door before Sheldon could react. Small feet pounded down the steps, the sound growing fainter with distance, replaced eventually by the higher-pitched sound of reunion.

"Father! Father!"

Sheldon moved to the engawa, watching from above. Nobuyuki had emerged from a modest sedan, suit jacket already shed, sleeves rolled up in preparation for country life. He caught Tenchi as the boy launched himself, swinging him up in a practiced arc that spoke of hundreds of such reunions.

"Hey, hey. I'm here. I'm here."

"You came early!"

"I took an earlier train. Wanted to see you sooner."

Tenchi's joy was incandescent, visible even from this distance. Sheldon felt something shift in his chest—not jealousy, exactly, but something adjacent to it. A recognition of what father and son shared, and his own position outside that particular bond.

*He's not replacing you*, he told himself. *You're not competing. Different roles. Different relationships.*

The mantra helped. A little.


Nobuyuki climbed the steps with Tenchi still in his arms, the boy chattering non-stop about everything that had happened since last weekend. Sheldon caught fragments—the pond, the roof, Sheldon's cooking, the dream about frogs—a week's worth of life compressed into breathless sentences.

"Tsukino-san." Nobuyuki reached the top, slightly winded, and inclined his head in greeting. "Good to see you again."

"And you. Welcome back."

"I hear you've been busy. Tenchi says the house is almost ready?"

"The roof should be done this weekend. Yamada's putting up tiles today."

"That's fast. Good." Nobuyuki set Tenchi down, the boy immediately grabbing his hand as if afraid he might float away. "And you're still cooking?"

"Teriyaki tonight. By request."

Nobuyuki's eyes flicked to Tenchi, then back to Sheldon. "He mentioned that. Several times." A small smile. "I'm looking forward to it."


The morning's remaining hours passed in the particular rhythm of family reunion.

Nobuyuki spent time with Tenchi—walking the grounds, admiring the cleared garden, exclaiming appropriately over each improvement Sheldon had made. The boy served as tour guide, his pride evident in every gesture, every explanation.

"See? The pond is clean now. Sheldon-san did that."

"I see."

"And the path has new stones. He fixed them all."

"I see that too."

"And he cooks the best food. Better than anyone. Even better than—" A pause, a glance at Katsuhito, a diplomatic pivot. "—restaurants."

Nobuyuki's eyes met Sheldon's across the garden, carrying something that might have been gratitude. Or acknowledgment. Or simply the recognition of one man seeing another's contribution to his son's happiness.

Sheldon nodded once and returned to the kitchen.

The teriyaki was ready.

#### Scene 13.B: The Dinner

Onigiri from the morning's rice, pickled vegetables, soup kept warm from breakfast. The family—and it was a family now, Sheldon realized, even if the configuration was unconventional—gathered around the low table with the easy comfort of people who had found their rhythm.

Nobuyuki ate with the particular focus of a man who'd skipped breakfast to catch an earlier train. Tenchi sat so close to his father that their shoulders touched, as if proximity could make up for five days of absence.

"The roof looks good," Nobuyuki said between bites. "Even from the road, I could see the difference."

"Yamada-san knows his work," Katsuhito replied. "And he had good help."

The old priest's eyes found Sheldon's, carrying acknowledgment that didn't need words. Sheldon nodded once and returned to his meal.


The afternoon belonged to father and son.

Sheldon retreated to the kitchen, preparing ingredients for dinner while the sounds of reunion drifted through the open doors. Tenchi's voice, high and bright. Nobuyuki's lower responses, patient and warm. The rhythm of a relationship maintained across distance, week by week.

The teriyaki fish came out of its marinade gleaming, the sauce having worked its way into every scored line. Sheldon laid it on the grill with careful attention, watching the heat transform raw protein into something greater.

*Timing*, the internal voice said. *Everything is timing. Too early and it won't caramelize. Too late and it burns. Find the moment and hold it.*

He found the moment. The fish sizzled, the sauce darkened to mahogany, the smell filled the kitchen with promises of satisfaction.


Dinner was served at six.

The four of them gathered around the table—Katsuhito at his customary place, Nobuyuki across from him, Tenchi vibrating between them, Sheldon completing the square. The teriyaki gleamed on its serving plate, flanked by rice and vegetables and the small dishes that made a meal into an occasion.

"Itadakimasu," they said together.

Tenchi waited approximately three seconds before reaching for the fish.

"Slowly," Nobuyuki cautioned. "It's not going anywhere."

"But it smells so good."

It did smell good. Sheldon had outdone himself, or the ability had outdone him—he wasn't sure which anymore. The fish was perfectly cooked, the sauce balanced between sweet and savory, the vegetables crisp with the right amount of char.

Nobuyuki took his first bite and went still.

"This is..." He paused, searching for words. "This is exceptional."

"Thank you."

"No, I mean—" The architect set down his chopsticks, giving the compliment proper weight. "I've eaten at restaurants in Tokyo. Expensive places. This is better than most of them."

Katsuhito made a small sound that might have been agreement.

"Father thinks so too," Tenchi announced, delighted to have his preferences validated. "I told you, Father. I told you Sheldon-san was the best."

"You did tell me. I should have believed you." Nobuyuki resumed eating, but his eyes kept returning to Sheldon with something like curiosity. "Where did you learn to cook like this?"

The question hung in the air. Sheldon had faced it before, from Katsuhito, from Yamada in different form. The answer was always the same—incomplete, true in spirit if not in detail.

"I've always enjoyed cooking. And I had a grandmother who believed food was love made visible."

"She must have been a remarkable woman."

"She was."

Nobuyuki accepted this, but Sheldon could see the questions accumulating behind his eyes. The architect wasn't stupid. He knew something didn't quite add up—a man who appeared from nowhere with restaurant-quality skills, who fit into this household like a missing piece, who had become essential to his son in less than two weeks.

*Later*, Sheldon thought. *Those questions are for later. Tonight is for dinner.*


The meal wound down into evening.

Tenchi talked through most of it—about school, about the garden, about the pond and the path and everything Sheldon had done while his father was away. Nobuyuki listened with the patience of a man who understood that listening was sometimes the most important thing a father could do.

"And Sheldon-san had a dream about stars," Tenchi said, somewhere between the main course and the fruit. "He told me about it."

Sheldon's chopsticks paused. He didn't remember telling Tenchi about the dream—but then again, children noticed things adults didn't mean to share. A expression, a distant look, a word murmured to no one in particular.

"Stars?" Nobuyuki asked.

"He said there were too many. Like someone spilled them." Tenchi's interpretation of whatever he'd overheard. "I think that sounds nice."

"It does," Nobuyuki agreed, his eyes finding Sheldon's again. "Dreams about stars are usually good ones."

Sheldon didn't correct him. The dream hadn't been about stars exactly—it had been about being seen by something vast, about a voice that spoke in bells and water. But *too many stars* was close enough. Closer than Tenchi should have been able to guess.


Bath time came and went.

Nobuyuki handled the ritual tonight—father and son in the ofuro together, their voices echoing through the house in a conversation Sheldon couldn't quite hear. He washed dishes instead, letting the familiar work occupy his hands while his mind wandered.

*Two weeks*, he thought. *Almost two weeks since I woke up in that field.*

It felt longer. It felt like months, years even. The person who had opened his eyes in the rice paddy seemed like a stranger now—confused, uncertain, unmoored. The person washing dishes in this kitchen knew where he belonged. Knew who needed him. Knew, at least in broad strokes, what he was supposed to be doing.

*You are becoming what you need to be.*

The dream-voice's words rose unbidden. Sheldon let them settle, neither accepting nor rejecting them. Time would tell what they meant. Time was the one thing he seemed to have plenty of.


Tenchi's bedtime was later than usual—special dispensation for a special day.

The boy fought sleep with the desperation of someone who knew that morning meant goodbye, that Sunday would pass too quickly, that Monday would take his father away again. But eventually even desperation lost to exhaustion, and Tenchi drifted off with one hand clutching his father's sleeve.

Nobuyuki extracted himself carefully, leaving the one-eared rabbit in his place, and joined Sheldon and Katsuhito in the main room.

"He's getting attached to you," Nobuyuki said without preamble. "More than I expected."

"Is that a problem?"

"I don't know yet." The architect accepted the tea Katsuhito offered, wrapping both hands around the cup. "It's not what I would have predicted. Tenchi has been... careful, since his mother died. He doesn't let people in easily."

"But he let you in," Katsuhito added, looking at Sheldon. "Almost immediately. As if he recognized something in you."

The words echoed things the old priest had said before—about children seeing clearly, about trust being given rather than earned. Sheldon didn't know how to respond, so he simply waited.

"I've been thinking about it all week," Nobuyuki continued. "Trying to understand what makes you different. You're kind, yes. Patient. Good with children. But other people have been kind to him, patient with him, and he's kept them at arm's length."

"Maybe it's timing," Sheldon offered. "Maybe he was ready to let someone in, and I happened to be the one who arrived."

"Maybe." Nobuyuki didn't sound convinced. "Or maybe there's something about you specifically. Something I can't see but he can."

The conversation brushed against territory Sheldon couldn't enter—the truth of his origin, the mystery of his gifts, the cosmic intervention that had placed him here. He felt the weight of secrets pressing against his tongue and kept them locked away.

"Whatever the reason," he said carefully, "I'm glad to be here. I'll do my best not to let him down."

"That's all anyone can ask." Nobuyuki finished his tea and set down the cup. "But if you hurt him—if you leave without warning, if you break his trust—"

"I won't."

"You can't know that."

"No," Sheldon admitted. "But I can know my intention. And my intention is to stay."

The two men regarded each other across the table—the father protecting his son, the stranger who had become something more. Something passed between them that wasn't quite acceptance but was adjacent to it. Recognition, maybe. Or the beginning of trust.

"Good night," Nobuyuki said finally. "And thank you. For the dinner, and for... everything else."

"Good night."


The house settled into sleep.

Sheldon sat alone on the engawa, watching the stars—normal stars, the right number of them—wheel slowly overhead. The night was cool but not cold, carrying the smells of spring and growing things.

*Thirteen days*, he thought. *And now I'm having conversations about intention and permanence with a man who barely knows me.*

But that was what family meant, wasn't it? Being known before you were understood. Being trusted before you'd proven yourself. Being given a place at the table and expected to earn it by staying.

He could do that. He would do that.

Tomorrow would bring Sunday, and then Monday, and then all the days after. The roof would be finished. The house would be ready. His life would continue, one day at a time, in this place he'd somehow been given.

*You are becoming what you need to be.*

He still didn't know what that meant. But he was starting to think it might not matter.

#### Scene 14.A: Fourteenth Morning

The fourteenth morning began with rain.

Sheldon woke to the sound of it drumming on the roof, steady and insistent, turning the world outside the screens into a gray wash of falling water. The kind of rain that wouldn't stop anytime soon—the kind that settled in and made itself comfortable.

*No tiles today*, he thought. *Yamada won't work in this.*

He rose anyway, following the routine that had become instinct over two weeks. Kitchen, pump, rice, soup. The rhythm of morning made manifest in small actions.


The household was slower to wake.

Sunday had its own pace, different from the weekday urgency of kindergarten buses and work schedules. When Nobuyuki finally appeared in the kitchen doorway, it was past seven—later than usual, the kind of indulgence that weekend visits allowed.

"Good morning." The architect's hair was still sleep-mussed, his borrowed yukata slightly askew. "Is that coffee?"

"Tea. But I can make coffee if you prefer."

"Tea is fine." Nobuyuki settled at the table, accepting the cup Sheldon poured. "Tenchi is still sleeping. He wore himself out yesterday."

"He was excited to see you."

"He's always excited." A small smile, carrying equal parts love and guilt. "I wish I could be here more often."

"He knows you work hard."

"Does knowing make it easier?"

The question hung in the air, weighted with the particular burden of a parent who felt he wasn't enough. Sheldon didn't have an answer—not a good one, not one that would help.

"I think," he said carefully, "that children understand more than we give them credit for. Tenchi knows you love him. He knows you come when you can. That's what matters."

"Is it?"

"It's all any of us can do. Love them and show up when we're able."

Nobuyuki studied him over the rim of his cup. "You sound like you've thought about this."

"I've had time to think. These past two weeks." Sheldon gestured toward the rain-gray window. "Days like this, when work isn't possible. The mind wanders."

"Where does it wander to?"

*White flowers. Too many stars. A voice like bells.* But that wasn't what Nobuyuki was asking about, and it wasn't what Sheldon could share.

"To what matters," he said instead. "To family. To building something that will last."


The morning passed in the particular rhythm of rainy Sundays.

Tenchi woke around eight, immediately seeking out his father, immediately demanding to know what they would do today. The rain meant no outdoor adventures, no trips to the village, no explorations of the forest path.

"We could tell stories," Nobuyuki offered.

"Boring."

"We could draw pictures."

"Did that yesterday."

"We could help Sheldon-san in the kitchen."

Tenchi's face brightened. "Can we? Can we cook something?"

Sheldon found himself recruited into a project before he could object—not that he would have. The boy's enthusiasm was infectious, transforming a rainy morning into an opportunity.

"What should we make?" Tenchi asked, bouncing on his toes.

"Something that takes time," Nobuyuki suggested, "since we have plenty of it."

The internal voice offered an answer before Sheldon consciously reached for one: *Nikujaga. Meat and potatoes. Comfort food for a gray day.*

"Nikujaga," he said aloud. "Do you know what that is?"

Tenchi's face lit up. "Mother used to make that."

The words landed like a stone in still water, sending ripples through the room. Nobuyuki's expression flickered—grief, memory, something that never quite healed.

"She did," he said quietly. "She made it for me on our first anniversary."

Sheldon hadn't known. Couldn't have known. But the internal voice had guided him to this, to a dish that carried memory and meaning for this family.

"Then we should make it together," he said. "All three of us."


Cooking became ceremony.

Sheldon demonstrated the techniques—how to cut the meat, how to slice the onions so they wouldn't make you cry, how to layer the potatoes just right. Tenchi watched with fierce attention, his small hands helping where they could. Nobuyuki worked beside them, a little awkward in the kitchen but willing to learn.

"Kiyone always said I had no talent for cooking," the architect admitted, fumbling with a peeler. "She wasn't wrong."

"Talent can be learned. What you need is patience."

"She used to say that too."

The conversation turned to memories—small stories about Kiyone, about her kitchen disasters and her eventual triumphs, about the way she laughed when things went wrong and the pride she took when they went right. Tenchi listened with the attention of someone hearing legends about a figure more myth than memory.

"She made the best nikujaga," Nobuyuki said, stirring the pot as Sheldon had shown him. "I never found anyone who could match it."

"Maybe this one will be close."

"Maybe."

But when they sat down to eat, and Nobuyuki took his first bite, something changed in his face. Not exactly recognition—the recipes weren't identical, couldn't be—but something adjacent to it. Familiarity. The echo of a taste he thought he'd lost.

"This is..." He stopped, swallowed, tried again. "This is very good."

"Is it close?" Tenchi asked, bouncing with hope. "Is it like Mother's?"

Nobuyuki looked at Sheldon, then at his son, then at the simple bowl of meat and potatoes that somehow carried so much weight.

"Yes," he said finally. "Yes, I think it is."

#### Scene 14.B: The Departure

The afternoon passed too quickly.

That was how it always was, Sheldon was learning—time moved differently depending on what was at stake. The slow hours of morning, filled with cooking and conversation, had given way to an afternoon that seemed to slip through fingers like water.

Nobuyuki played with Tenchi in the main room, the rain still drumming outside, their laughter echoing through the shrine. Card games, drawing contests, the kind of simple activities that required nothing but presence and attention. Sheldon watched from the kitchen, preparing dinner, feeling the weight of the approaching goodbye.

At four o'clock, Nobuyuki began to gather his things.

"Already?" Tenchi asked, his voice small.

"The train schedule doesn't care about our plans." Nobuyuki crouched to meet his son's eyes. "You know I have to go back."

"I know."

"But I'll be here next Saturday. Same as always."

"Saturday is forever away."

"It always feels that way." Nobuyuki pulled the boy into a hug, holding him with the particular intensity of a parent who knew he was leaving. "But the days go by faster than you think. And Sheldon-san will be here. And Grandfather. You won't be alone."

Tenchi's face was pressed against his father's chest, muffling whatever he said in response. But his arms tightened, and he didn't let go for a long time.


The goodbye was its own kind of ritual.

Katsuhito emerged from wherever he'd been—meditating, perhaps, or giving father and son privacy—to see Nobuyuki off. The four of them gathered on the engawa, the rain having finally eased to a drizzle, the late afternoon light gray and soft.

"Take care of them," Nobuyuki said to Sheldon, the words pitched low enough that Tenchi couldn't hear.

"I will."

"And take care of yourself. The house will be ready soon. You'll have your own life to build."

"I know."

Nobuyuki studied him for a moment, as if searching for something in Sheldon's face. Whatever he found seemed to satisfy him, because he nodded once and turned to his father.

"The shrine looks good," he said. "Better than it has in years."

"We've had help." Katsuhito's eyes found Sheldon. "Good help."

"I can see that."

The handshake between father and son was brief and formal, the kind of gesture that carried decades of relationship in its simplicity. Then Nobuyuki crouched down one more time to Tenchi's level.

"Be good. Listen to your grandfather. And to Sheldon-san."

"I will."

"I know you will." One more hug, shorter this time but no less fierce. "I love you."

"I love you too."


The car disappeared down the mountain road, swallowed by trees and distance and the gray of fading afternoon.

Tenchi stood at the top of the steps, watching long after there was nothing to see. Sheldon stood beside him, close enough to touch but not quite touching—present, available, waiting.

"I don't like Sundays," Tenchi said finally.

"I know."

"He always leaves on Sundays."

"I know that too."

The boy turned to look at him, eyes red-rimmed but dry. "Will you leave on a Sunday?"

The question hit harder than expected. Sheldon felt it land in his chest, in the place where promises lived and where breaking them would matter most.

"I don't know when I'll leave," he said honestly. "But I don't have anywhere else to go. And I don't want to be anywhere else."

"Promise?"

"I promise to stay as long as I can. As long as you need me."

It wasn't the forever Tenchi wanted. But it was the truth, and the boy seemed to recognize it as such. He nodded once, wiped his face with the back of his hand, and turned toward the shrine.

"Can we have hot chocolate? Sheldon-san?"

"I think we can manage that."


The evening was quiet.

Hot chocolate for Tenchi, tea for the adults, the four of them sitting in the main room as night settled over the mountain. The rain had stopped, leaving behind the particular clarity that came after storms—air washed clean, stars beginning to emerge through breaking clouds.

"The roof should be done tomorrow," Katsuhito said. "Weather permitting."

"That fast?"

"Yamada-san is efficient. And the east side was less damaged." The old priest sipped his tea. "You could be in the house by the end of the week."

*By the end of the week.* The words carried more weight now than they had before. Moving into the Tsukino house meant leaving the shrine—not permanently, not completely, but in a way that would change everything. Different meals, different mornings, different nights spent under a different roof.

"I'll still be here," Sheldon said, as much to himself as to anyone else. "Every day. That won't change."

"I know." Katsuhito's eyes held understanding. "But change is coming anyway. It's better to prepare for it than to pretend it isn't happening."

Tenchi had fallen asleep against Sheldon's side, the hot chocolate having worked its magic. The boy's breathing was slow and even, his small body warm and heavy with trust.

"He's attached," Katsuhito continued. "More than I expected. More than is perhaps healthy."

"Is that my fault?"

"No. It's not fault at all. It's simply what happened." The old priest set down his cup. "Children need anchors. You became his. That's not wrong—it's necessary. But it means you carry a responsibility now that you didn't ask for."

"I know."

"Do you?" The question wasn't accusatory, just curious. "Do you understand what it means to be needed by a child who has already lost too much?"

Sheldon looked down at Tenchi, at the small face peaceful in sleep, at the hand still clutching his sleeve even in unconsciousness.

"I'm beginning to," he said. "Day by day."

"Good." Katsuhito rose. "I'll take him to bed. You should rest. Tomorrow will be busy."


Sleep came slowly.

Sheldon lay in the guest room—his room, Nobuyuki's room, the room that had become familiar over two weeks—and listened to the shrine settle into nighttime silence. The rain had truly stopped now, leaving only the drip of water from eaves and leaves, the gradual return of insect sounds.

*Two weeks*, he thought. *Fourteen days since I woke up in that field.*

It felt like longer. It felt like years. The person who had opened his eyes in the rice paddy seemed impossibly distant now—a stranger wearing his face, lost and confused and not yet knowing what he would become.

*You are becoming what you need to be.*

The dream-voice's words rose again, as they did more often now. Sheldon let them settle, finding in them a comfort that surprised him.

Whatever he was becoming, it involved this place. These people. This child who had chosen to trust him, this old priest who had chosen to accept him, this absent father who had chosen to allow him into his family's life.

*It's enough*, he thought. *For now, it's enough.*

He slept, and dreamed of nothing, and woke to the fifteenth morning.

#### Scene 15.A: Fifteenth Morning

The fifteenth morning came clear and bright.

Sheldon woke to sunlight streaming through the paper screens, the rain of yesterday a memory dissolved by a sky scrubbed clean of clouds. The kind of day that invited work, that demanded progress, that would brook no further delays.

*The roof*, he thought. *Today the roof is finished.*

He rose with purpose, the routine of morning now so deeply ingrained that his body moved without consulting his mind. Pump, rice, soup. The kettle heating. The first sounds of the household stirring.

Two weeks. Fifteen days since he'd opened his eyes in that field. And today, a milestone.


Breakfast was quick and efficient.

Tenchi was subdued in the way of Monday mornings—the weekend's joy faded, school waiting, the particular melancholy of five days stretching between now and Father's next visit. But he ate his rice without complaint, helped clear the dishes without being asked, and marched toward the waiting bus with only one backward glance at the top of the steps.

"Wave," Sheldon called, and waved himself.

Tenchi waved back, the gesture smaller than last week's, carrying the weight of accumulated goodbyes. Then he disappeared down the mountain, swallowed by the yellow bus and the ordinary machinery of weekday life.

"The house is waiting," Katsuhito said from behind him.

"I know."

"Yamada will be there already. He likes to start early after rain delays."

Sheldon nodded and went to gather his things.


The Tsukino house looked different in the morning sun.

The roof gleamed where new tiles had been laid—darker than the weathered originals, but matching in style and shape. The work Yamada had done over the past week was visible now, a patchwork of old and new that somehow cohered into a unified whole.

*Like me*, Sheldon thought. *Old and new. Different pieces, somehow fitting together.*

Yamada was on the scaffold already, laying the final section of tile on the east side. The roofer didn't pause as Sheldon approached, his attention focused on the work with the intensity of someone who knew they were close to completion.

"Last section," he said. "Another hour, maybe two."

"Anything you need from me?"

"Tea at ten. Otherwise, stay out of the way."

The familiar instruction, carrying no sting now. Sheldon had learned what Yamada meant by it—not dismissal, but respect for process. The work was the work. It didn't need company.


He went to the pond instead.

The surface was clear now, reflecting the sky in a mirror that rippled with each breath of wind. The work he'd done last week had held—no new debris, no returned murk. Just clean water over river-rock stones, waiting to be fully restored.

The edges still needed attention. Wild growth had claimed the banks, sending roots into the water, tangling with the careful stonework that had once defined the pond's shape. Sheldon found his tools and began the slow process of reclamation.

*Itsuki's place*, he thought, remembering what Katsuhito had told him. *The place she loved.*

He worked with that awareness in mind—not just clearing neglect, but honoring memory. Every cut of wild grass, every stone returned to its proper position, every inch of bank revealed beneath overgrowth felt like a small act of restoration. Not just of the pond, but of something larger.


Ten o'clock came and went.

Sheldon brought tea to Yamada, watched the roofer work for a few minutes, then returned to the pond. The pattern repeated at noon, when he brought lunch—onigiri from the morning's rice, pickled vegetables, a thermos of soup.

Yamada ate without stopping work, the tiles clicking into place with a rhythm that spoke of approaching completion.

"Almost done," the roofer said between bites.

"I can see that."

"Tomorrow I'll come back for the flashing. One more day after that for sealing." Yamada wiped his hands on his work cloth. "Then it's yours."

*Yours.* The word landed with unexpected weight. The house would be his—truly his, ready to live in, waiting for him to make it home.

"How much do I owe you?"

Yamada pulled a folded paper from his pocket—the estimate, marked up with adjustments. "Two hundred sixty thousand. The east side was easier than I expected."

Less than estimated. Sheldon felt something loosen in his chest—not quite relief, but the particular satisfaction of plans working out better than feared.

"I can pay you now. Full amount."

"Half now. Half when the sealing's done." The roofer's eyes held the particular honor of a man who kept his word and expected others to do the same. "That's how I work."

"Then half now."

Sheldon counted out the bills—cash from the envelope that had been waiting when he woke, the money that still felt borrowed from someone else's life. But it was his now, his to spend, his to use in building whatever came next.

Yamada accepted the payment without counting it. "The house will be good now. Another forty years, at least, before it needs major work."

"Forty years."

"Maybe fifty, if you take care of it." The roofer tucked the money away. "You seem like someone who takes care of things."


The afternoon stretched ahead, full of possibility.

Sheldon returned to the pond, working through the quiet hours while Yamada finished the last of the tiles. By mid-afternoon, the roof was done—complete, whole, ready to face whatever weather came.

Yamada descended from the scaffold for the final time, surveying his work with the critical eye of a craftsman.

"Good," he said finally. "It'll do."

High praise, from Yamada. Sheldon had learned to recognize it.

"Thank you. For everything."

"Thank me when the sealing's done." But the roofer extended his hand anyway, and Sheldon shook it. "You've been a good client, Tsukino-san. I meant what I said before. I'll tell people that."

"I appreciate it."

"Don't appreciate it. Earn it. Take care of the house. Take care of the people who matter to you." Yamada began packing his tools. "That's how you pay back trust."

*Take care of the people who matter.* The words echoed something Nobuyuki had said, something Katsuhito had implied. The same message, arriving from different directions.

Sheldon watched Yamada drive away, watched the truck disappear down the mountain road, watched the dust settle in its wake. Then he turned and looked at the house.

His house. Fifteen days since he'd arrived, and now he had a home.

*You are becoming what you need to be.*

For the first time, he thought he might understand what that meant.


- "Honoring memory" of Itsuki
- Surface clear; banks being reclaimed

**Yamada's Farewell:**

> "Take care of the house. Take care of the people who matter to you. That's how you pay back trust."

**15-Day Milestone:**

- Roof completion = home nearly ready
- "Fifteen days since he'd arrived, and now he had a home"
- Dream-voice understanding: "For the first time, he thought he might understand what that meant."

#### Scene 15.B: Fifteenth Evening

The walk back to the shrine felt different this evening.

Sheldon moved along the familiar path—three hundred meters of packed earth winding upward through the cedars—and found himself cataloguing changes. Two weeks ago, he'd stumbled up this same incline in the dark, disoriented and newly arrived in a body he didn't understand. Now his feet knew every root, every slight dip where rain pooled during storms, every spot where the late afternoon light broke through the canopy in golden shafts.

*Two weeks,* he thought. *Fifteen days. And I have a house now.*

Not quite his yet—the flashing work tomorrow, the sealing the day after—but close. Close enough that he could see it happening. Close enough that "temporary guest" was transforming into something more permanent.

The shrine emerged from the trees as it always did: first the stone torii gate, weathered red paint showing through grey, then the grounds opening before him like a clearing in a forest. The late sun caught the main building's roof, the old tiles glowing amber in the fading light.

And there, on the engawa of the residence, a small figure bounced to his feet.

"Sheldon-san!"

Tenchi launched himself across the courtyard before Sheldon had finished passing through the gate. The boy's momentum carried him into a collision-hug that hit Sheldon mid-thigh, small arms wrapping tight.

"You're back! Grandfather said the roof was finished today. Is it finished? Is it really? Can I see it? When can I see it?"

The questions tumbled out in a breathless rush, and Sheldon found himself smiling down at the crown of dark hair pressed against his hip.

"One at a time, small one." He rested a hand on Tenchi's head, feeling the silky warmth of the boy's hair. "Yes, it's finished. The tiles are all in place. Yamada-san and his team did excellent work."

"Can we go see? Right now?"

"Tomorrow," Sheldon said. "Yamada-san is coming back to do the flashing around the edges. You can meet him properly."

Tenchi's face scrunched in temporary disappointment, then smoothed as he found a new angle of attack. "What about dinner? Grandfather said you'd be tired from watching all day. Are you tired? I'm not tired. I had apple juice at school and sensei said I was very energetic."

"Did she now."

"She said it three times. That means it's important, right?"

Sheldon bit back a laugh. "I'm sure it does."


The kitchen warmth enveloped him as he stepped inside, the familiar scent of rice steam and something savory filling the space. Katsuhito stood at the counter, knife moving in patient strokes through what looked like daikon radish.

"Ah," the old priest said without turning. "The inspector returns. How does our new roof look?"

"Solid." Sheldon moved to wash his hands at the sink, shoulder-to-shoulder with Katsuhito at the counter. "Yamada-san knows his work. The tiles are seated properly, the batten strips are secured, the underlayment looked sound when I checked this morning."

"You checked the underlayment."

"I walked the ridgeline before the team arrived. The view is... educational."

Katsuhito's knife paused. "You walked the ridgeline of a roof."

"Someone should inspect the work properly." Sheldon dried his hands, reaching for an apron from the hook. "What are we making?"

"Oden." Katsuhito resumed his steady slicing. "Spring oden. Lighter than winter version. The daikon, some eggs, fishcake. Perhaps some tofu."

"I'll handle the broth."

They worked in comfortable silence for several minutes, Sheldon measuring dashi stock and adjusting seasonings while Katsuhito prepared the vegetables. Through the window, the courtyard was losing its golden light, the shadows of the cedars stretching long across the gravel.

"The boy has been counting hours since school ended," Katsuhito said quietly. "He asked me four times when you would return."

"Four times?"

"That I heard. Possibly more."

Sheldon stirred the broth, watching bubbles form at the edges of the pot. "He seems... settled. More than when I first arrived."

"He is." Katsuhito set down his knife, turning to face Sheldon directly. "You have given him something to look forward to each day. Someone who will be there. For a child who has lost that certainty once already, this is not a small thing."

The words landed somewhere in Sheldon's chest, warm and heavy. He thought of Tenchi's face at the breakfast table each morning—the way the boy's eyes lit up when Sheldon emerged from the guest room. The trust in that reaction. The expectation.

"I'm not going anywhere," Sheldon said.

"No." Katsuhito's eyes held that steady assessment Sheldon had come to recognize. "I don't believe you are. The house will be ready soon. Two days, Yamada said?"

"Two days for the work. I could move in by Thursday, if the weather holds."

"Thursday." The old priest nodded slowly. "Four more mornings here. Then three hundred meters of distance."

"Three hundred meters is nothing. Tenchi can—"

"Tenchi knows." Katsuhito's voice was gentle. "He has been preparing. Asking questions about how often he can visit, whether you'll still eat breakfast here, whether he can help with the garden."

Sheldon's throat tightened. "The garden?"

"The one you've been planning. He told me about it yesterday. Vegetables, he said. And herbs for cooking. He wants to help you plant them."

The image rose unbidden: Tenchi's small hands pressing seeds into fresh-turned earth, the boy's face bright with concentration as he helped bring something new to life. A garden. Their garden.

"I hadn't—" Sheldon paused, recalibrating. "I mentioned it once. Just thinking out loud. I didn't realize he was listening so closely."

"He listens to everything you say." Katsuhito turned back to his vegetables. "A child who has lost a parent watches the adults around him with great attention. He is learning how to be. Watching how you move through the world."

*How I move through the world.* 

Sheldon stirred the broth again, though it didn't need stirring. The weight of that responsibility settled on his shoulders—not unpleasantly, but present. Real.

"I'll try to be worthy of it," he said quietly.

"You already are." Katsuhito's knife resumed its rhythm. "That is why he chose you."


Dinner gathered them around the low table in the main room, the oden pot steaming at the center. Tenchi had claimed his usual spot at Sheldon's left, close enough that their elbows occasionally bumped when the boy reached for more fishcake.

"Grandfather said you walked on the roof," Tenchi announced between bites. "On the very top part."

"The ridgeline," Sheldon confirmed. "To check the tiles."

"Wasn't it scary? Being up so high?"

Sheldon considered the question. The answer that came surprised him—not because it was untrue, but because he hadn't consciously registered it until now.

"No," he said. "It wasn't scary. It felt... right. Like I belonged up there."

Tenchi's eyes went wide. "Like a ninja?"

"Like someone who needed to see if the work was done properly." Sheldon selected a piece of daikon from the pot. "Though I suppose ninjas might also inspect roofs. For different reasons."

"Secret reasons," Tenchi agreed solemnly. "Do you think Yamada-san is a ninja?"

"I think Yamada-san is a very skilled roofer who appreciates good craftsmanship."

"That's what a ninja would *want* you to think."

Katsuhito made a small sound that might have been a laugh suppressed. Sheldon glanced at the old priest, catching the gleam of amusement in those calm eyes.

"The boy makes a fair point," Katsuhito said mildly. "Hidden in plain sight. The classic approach."

"You're encouraging him."

"I am observing the conversation with scholarly interest."

Tenchi beamed, apparently delighted to have both adults engaged in his theory. "When I grow up, I want to be a ninja. Or maybe someone who fixes roofs. Or both. A ninja roofer."

"A worthy ambition," Katsuhito said. "The combination of stealth and practical trade skills would be formidable."

Sheldon shook his head, but he was smiling. This was what fifteen days had built: easy banter around a dinner table, a four-year-old's elaborate theories, an old priest's dry humor. Family, or something approaching it.


The evening routine unfolded in its now-familiar pattern. Tenchi's bath, supervised by Katsuhito while Sheldon cleaned the kitchen. Then the brief overlap in the main room where the boy's energy finally began to flag, his movements growing slower, his sentences stretching with yawns.

"Story?" Tenchi asked, already half-asleep against Sheldon's side on the cushions.

"One story."

Sheldon had started this three days ago—telling Tenchi stories from his own memory, adapted for a four-year-old audience. Not fairy tales exactly, but not quite history either. Stories about people who built things, who created solutions to problems, who persevered.

Tonight he chose one about a man who built a bridge across a river that everyone said couldn't be bridged. The details were vague—Sheldon couldn't remember where he'd first heard it, or whether it was even true—but the shape of the story was clear. Problem, attempt, failure, learning, attempt, success.

Tenchi was asleep before the bridge was half-finished, his breathing soft and even against Sheldon's arm.

Katsuhito appeared in the doorway. He took in the scene without comment, then moved silently to lift the sleeping boy from Sheldon's side. Tenchi murmured something unintelligible and nestled against his grandfather's shoulder.

"Goodnight," Katsuhito said softly.

"Goodnight."


The night had settled fully by the time Sheldon stepped onto the engawa. The stars were out in force, the Milky Way a pale river across the darkness. The air was cool but not cold, carrying the scent of cedar and the deeper green smell of spring growth.

Three hundred meters away, invisible in the darkness but present in his awareness, his house waited.

*My house.*

The thought still felt strange. Fifteen days ago, he'd owned nothing—not even a clear sense of who he was or how he'd arrived. Now he had a home. A community that knew his face. A child who counted the hours until he returned.

*What am I becoming?*

The question rose as it sometimes did, usually late at night when the day's activity had quieted. He wasn't the person he remembered being. That man had been older, more worn, his body a collection of accumulated damages and accommodations. This body—young, strong, impossibly restored—belonged to someone else. Someone he was still learning to be.

But perhaps that was the point. Perhaps becoming wasn't about understanding what you were, but about choosing what you would be.

He thought of the roof he'd walked that morning, steady and sure-footed on the ridgeline. He thought of Tenchi's face lighting up when he entered the courtyard. He thought of Katsuhito's words: *You are worthy of it.*

Not yet, perhaps. But working on it. Every day, a little more.

The stars wheeled overhead in their ancient patterns. Somewhere in the darkness, an owl called its hunting cry. Sheldon stood on the engawa of Masaki Shrine and let the night hold him.

Two more days of work. Then a home of his own.

The thought no longer frightened him. It felt, instead, like the next step in a journey he was only beginning to understand.

#### Scene 16.A: Sixteenth Morning

The sixteenth morning arrived with rain.

Sheldon woke to the sound of it—a steady patter against the roof tiles, gentler than a storm but persistent enough to change the texture of the day. He lay still for a moment, listening to the rhythm of water on wood and stone, feeling the slight drop in temperature that rain always brought.

*Flashing day,* he thought. *Yamada-san won't be pleased.*

But even as the thought formed, he reconsidered. Yamada Kenji had struck him as the kind of craftsman who factored weather into his calculations, who knew when rain would interfere and when it could be worked around. Flashing work—the metal strips that sealed the edges where roof met wall—was precise work, but it wasn't necessarily rain-dependent.

He rose, dressed in the worn clothes he'd designated for work observation, and made his way to the kitchen.


Katsuhito was already there, as he often was now—Sheldon had stopped trying to determine whether the old priest woke before him or simply never seemed to sleep at all. The kitchen held the quiet warmth of early morning, the small stove already lit, water heating for tea.

"Rain," Katsuhito observed, not looking up from where he was slicing pickled vegetables. "The weatherman on NHK predicted it would clear by noon."

"You watched the weather report?"

"Tenchi wanted to see Minna no Uta before school. The weather came before it." A slight pause in the knife work. "He was very concerned about your roof."

Sheldon felt the familiar warmth that came with evidence of Tenchi's care. "The flashing should be fine in light rain. It's the sealing tomorrow that needs dry conditions."

"Ah. Then the weatherman's timing is convenient."

"Suspiciously so."

Katsuhito's knife resumed its steady rhythm. "Perhaps the spirits of the mountain are looking out for you."

"Or perhaps weather patterns in April are predictable enough that skilled roofers plan around them."

"That too."

They worked together in companionable silence—Sheldon preparing rice, Katsuhito finishing the pickles. By the time Tenchi emerged from his room, still rubbing sleep from his eyes, breakfast was ready.


"Is Yamada-san really a ninja?" Tenchi asked, chopsticks pausing midway to his mouth.

Sheldon exchanged a glance with Katsuhito over the boy's head. The ninja roofer theory, apparently, had survived overnight.

"I don't think ninja typically announce their arrival with trucks full of roofing materials," Sheldon said carefully.

"That's exactly what a ninja *would* do. To throw off suspicion."

"The boy has a point," Katsuhito murmured. "Misdirection is fundamental to the ninja arts."

"You're not helping."

"I am maintaining scholarly neutrality."

Tenchi beamed, clearly delighted by the ongoing engagement with his theory. "When you see him today, can you watch for ninja signs? Like if he disappears in smoke or walks on water?"

"The house isn't near water."

"What about smoke?"

Sheldon considered the metal flashing work, the small torch Yamada might use for certain fittings. "There may be some smoke involved in the process, actually."

Tenchi's eyes went wide with vindication. "I *knew* it."


The walk to the Tsukino house was different in the rain.

Sheldon had borrowed an umbrella from the shrine's collection—a traditional paper-and-bamboo affair that felt pleasantly archaic in his grip. The path was familiar now, every root and hollow known, but the rain transformed it. Water gathered in the low spots he'd learned to step over. The cedars seemed darker, their bark almost black with moisture. The air smelled of green growth and wet earth.

Three hundred meters. In two days, this would be his daily commute in reverse—from his house to the shrine, rather than shrine to house. The thought still carried a slight unreality, as if he were planning someone else's life.

*But it's not someone else's life anymore,* he reminded himself. *It's yours. You're making it yours.*

The Tsukino house emerged from the grey curtain of rain like a ship materializing from fog. And there, already present despite the early hour, was Yamada Kenji's battered white truck.


The roofer was on the covered engawa when Sheldon arrived, sipping tea from a thermos and studying the house with the patient attention of a doctor examining a patient.

"Tsukino-san." Yamada rose, offering a slight bow. "You're early."

"I wanted to see the process."

"Ah." Something shifted in Yamada's expression—approval, perhaps, or simply recognition. "The rain will stop before noon. NHK said so."

"So I heard."

"My wife listens every morning. She called me at five to confirm."

Sheldon found himself smiling. "Tenchi—the boy at the shrine—watches the same channel. He was also concerned about the weather."

"Children understand what matters." Yamada turned back to study the roofline. "The flashing work won't suffer from a little moisture. We'll start with the preparation—measuring, cutting. By the time we're ready to mount, the rain should be finished."

"Can I help?"

The question surprised them both, Sheldon thought. He hadn't planned to ask it. But something in him wanted to be more than an observer today. Wanted to learn the process, to understand how the work was done.

Yamada studied him for a long moment. "You climbed the ridgeline."

"To inspect."

"My apprentice told me. Said you moved like you'd done it before."

Sheldon had no response to that. The truth was, he didn't know why climbing had felt so natural, why his body had known exactly how to balance on the narrow ridge while his mind insisted he'd never done anything like it.

"I have an extra set of tin snips," Yamada said finally. "If you're willing to learn."


The morning passed in a rhythm Sheldon found unexpectedly satisfying.

Yamada was a patient teacher, explaining each step of the process without condescension. The flashing material—thin galvanized steel—had to be measured precisely, cut cleanly, shaped to fit the specific angles where roof met wall. Every house was different, Yamada explained. Every joint had its own personality.

"You read the building," the roofer said, demonstrating how to mark a measurement. "You don't impose your will on it. You find what it needs and provide that."

Sheldon's hands remembered something—not this specific skill, but the general shape of precision work. The careful measurement, the clean cut, the satisfaction of a piece that fit exactly as intended. His past life had involved different tools, different materials, but the fundamental approach was the same.

*Listen to what the problem is telling you,* he thought. *Don't assume. Observe.*

By mid-morning, the rain had eased to a drizzle. By eleven, it had stopped entirely, leaving the world washed clean and dripping. Steam began to rise from the cedar bark as weak sunlight broke through the clouds.

"Good timing," Yamada observed. "We can begin mounting the valley pieces."

"Valley pieces?"

"Where two roof sections meet." Yamada pointed to the corner where the main house connected to what had once been a small storage addition. "Water wants to gather there. The flashing needs to guide it safely down. Like building a river channel."

They climbed together—Yamada up a ladder, Sheldon following after the roofer confirmed the rungs were sound. The roof was still damp but not dangerously slick, and Sheldon found his footing with the same strange certainty he'd felt on the ridgeline.

"You've done this before," Yamada said, watching him.

"I don't think I have."

"Your body disagrees."

There was no accusation in the observation, just curiosity. Yamada, Sheldon was learning, approached people the same way he approached buildings—observing without imposing, noting what was there without demanding explanation.

"I don't understand it either," Sheldon admitted. "A lot of things about me don't make sense right now."

Yamada was quiet for a moment, fitting a piece of flashing into position. "My grandmother used to say that some skills come from before. From other lives, or from the ancestors, or from the spirits. She said a person's hands remember what their mind has forgotten."

"Do you believe that?"

"I believe—" Yamada paused, considering. "I believe that a good craftsman doesn't question useful skills. He accepts them, trains them, uses them well."

The flashing slid into place. Yamada secured it with practiced efficiency.

"You have steady hands," he said. "Good balance. A willingness to learn. These are not small things."


By noon, the valley flashing was complete and the edge work was well underway. Yamada declared a lunch break, and they sat together on the engawa, sharing rice balls Sheldon had brought from the shrine.

"Tomorrow we seal everything," Yamada said between bites. "If the weather holds, you could move in by Thursday evening."

"That's the plan."

"It's a good house." Yamada looked at the structure with something approaching affection. "Old, but well-made. The bones are sound. Whoever built it knew what they were doing."

"Do you know who that was?"

"Before my time. But I worked on this roof once before, maybe fifteen years ago. Small repair after a storm. The woman who lived here then—your mother, yes?—she made tea for the crew afterward. Very kind woman."

Sheldon felt the familiar ache that came with mentions of the family he was inhabiting. Sachiko Tsukino. The woman in the photograph. The mother he'd never met but whose name he now carried.

"I wish I'd known her better," he said, which was true in a way that went deeper than Yamada could know.

"Family is complicated." Yamada finished his rice ball, brushed his hands clean. "Sometimes we know people better after they're gone than we did when they were here. We find their marks on the world and understand them through those marks."

He gestured at the house—the solid construction, the careful details, the garden that had been allowed to grow wild but still showed the bones of intentional design.

"This place tells you who they were. What they valued. How they wanted to live." Yamada rose, stretching. "That's a kind of knowing too."


The afternoon work continued until the light began to fail. Yamada packed his tools with the same meticulous care he applied to everything else, loading the truck as the shadows lengthened.

"Tomorrow, eight o'clock," he said. "Sealing goes faster than flashing. We should be done by mid-afternoon."

"I'll be here."

Yamada paused at the truck door. "You're not what I expected, Tsukino-san."

"What did you expect?"

"Someone from the city. Someone who would hire the work done and wait inside while it happened." Yamada shook his head slowly. "You climbed the ridgeline. You learned to cut flashing. You asked questions about the craft, not just the timeline."

"I want to understand my house."

"Yes." Yamada nodded, something like satisfaction in his weathered face. "That's exactly it. You want to understand your house. Not just own it—understand it."

He climbed into the truck, engine coughing to life.

"Tomorrow," he called through the window. "Bring gloves. The sealant is unpleasant on bare hands."

The truck rattled down the narrow road, leaving Sheldon alone with his house and the fading light.

*Your house,* he thought. *Your home.*

The words were starting to feel true.

#### Scene 16.B: Sixteenth Evening

The walk back to the shrine felt earned tonight.

Sheldon's hands ached pleasantly from the work—the tin snips had required a grip strength he'd forgotten he possessed, and the repeated cuts had left faint red marks across his palms. Not blisters, not yet, but the promise of calluses to come. Evidence of labor.

*Yamada's grandmother was right,* he thought as he climbed the familiar path. *The hands remember.*

The evening air was clean after the rain, carrying the sharp green scent of wet cedar and the deeper earth-smell of the forest floor. Somewhere above, a bird sang its evening song—three notes descending, then silence, then the pattern repeated. Sheldon found himself counting the repetitions, matching his footsteps to the rhythm.

The shrine emerged from the trees, and with it came the sound he'd been anticipating: small feet on gravel, moving fast.

"Sheldon-san! Did you see any ninja signs?"

Tenchi materialized from the direction of the main hall, still in his kindergarten clothes but with the slightly disheveled look of a child who'd been playing hard since school ended. His eyes were bright with expectation.

"I saw smoke," Sheldon said gravely.

Tenchi's whole body vibrated with vindication. "I *told* you! I told Grandfather! What kind of smoke? Was it disappearing smoke?"

"It was... metalworking smoke. From the torch Yamada-san uses for certain fittings."

"That's probably how ninja make their special smoke bombs. They learned it from metalworking."

The logic was impeccable, in its way. Sheldon found himself nodding along despite his better judgment.

"Also," he added, "Yamada-san knew things about the house that he shouldn't have been able to see. Small details. Hidden things."

This was technically true—the roofer had an uncanny eye for structural issues that weren't visible from the surface. But Tenchi's interpretation was predictably different.

"Secret ninja knowledge," the boy breathed. "Did he teach you any?"

"He taught me to cut flashing."

"Is flashing a ninja technique?"

"It's a roofing technique. But—" Sheldon paused, considering how to phrase this. "He said something interesting. About how some skills come from before. From... other lives, or ancestors."

Tenchi's eyes went very wide. "Yamada-san knows about past lives?"

"His grandmother did. He was sharing her wisdom."

"That's definitely ninja wisdom." Tenchi nodded with absolute certainty. "Ninjas have to remember their past life training, or they'd have to start over every time."

Sheldon had no response to this that wouldn't encourage further elaboration. He settled for ruffling the boy's hair and steering them both toward the residence.

"Let's see what your grandfather is making for dinner."


Katsuhito had prepared nimono—simmered vegetables in a light broth, the kind of simple evening meal that felt restorative after a long day. They ate together at the low table, Tenchi providing a running commentary on his day at kindergarten between bites.

"—and then Yuki-chan said her father saw a tanuki on the mountain road, but I said tanuki don't come out in the daytime, and sensei said actually sometimes they do if they're hungry, but Yuki-chan's tanuki was probably a regular dog because tanuki have rounder faces—"

The words washed over Sheldon like warm water, requiring no response beyond occasional nods and sounds of interest. This was another thing he'd learned in sixteen days: Tenchi's monologues were not requests for engagement so much as shared processing. The boy thought out loud, working through his day by narrating it.

"—and then at lunch Kenji-kun traded me his pickled plum for my egg because he doesn't like eggs but I like everything so it was a good trade—"

Across the table, Katsuhito caught Sheldon's eye and offered the smallest of smiles. The old priest had clearly heard variations on these narratives countless times, but his attention never flagged. He listened to his grandson with the same patient focus he brought to everything else.

*This is family,* Sheldon thought. *This is what it looks like from the inside.*

The thought carried less strangeness than it once had. Sixteen days of shared meals, shared routines, shared silences and conversations. The bonds were real now, woven from small moments accumulated over time.

"The sealing work is tomorrow?" Katsuhito asked during a pause in Tenchi's narrative.

"Yes. Yamada-san expects to finish by mid-afternoon."

"And then?"

"Then the house is ready. I could move in Thursday, if the inspection goes well."

Tenchi's chopsticks paused. "Thursday is soon."

"It is."

"But you'll still come for breakfast? You said you would."

"Every morning," Sheldon confirmed. "And dinner most nights, if your grandfather doesn't get tired of feeding me."

"The kitchen has never been more interesting," Katsuhito said mildly. "It would be a shame to return to my own limited repertoire."

"You cook fine."

"I cook adequately. You cook as though the food is speaking to you and you are simply translating."

Sheldon had no response to that either. The observation was more accurate than comfortable.


The evening routine unfolded in its familiar pattern—Tenchi's bath, the brief period of post-bath energy followed by the gradual wind-down, the request for a story that Sheldon suspected was becoming as much ritual as entertainment.

Tonight he chose a story about a craftsman who built boats. A man who learned to read the grain of wood, to understand what each piece wanted to become. The parallels to Yamada's philosophy weren't subtle, but Tenchi seemed to appreciate them anyway.

"The boat builder listened to the wood," Tenchi repeated drowsily, curled against Sheldon's side. "Like Yamada-san listens to roofs."

"Something like that."

"And you're learning to listen too."

"I'm trying."

Tenchi's breathing slowed, deepened. Within minutes, he was asleep—the sudden transition of childhood exhaustion finally claiming its due.

Katsuhito appeared silently to carry the boy to bed. The ritual was smooth now, practiced, requiring no words.


Later, on the engawa, Sheldon sat with tea cooling in his hands and watched the stars emerge.

Tomorrow, the sealing. Thursday, the move. A new chapter beginning even as this first one approached its close.

*Sixteen days,* he thought. *And everything is different.*

Not just the external circumstances—the house, the routines, the relationships. Something inside had shifted too. He'd arrived in this place lost, confused, uncertain of everything including himself. Now... now he had purpose. Direction. People who expected him to be there, who would notice if he wasn't.

*You're learning to listen,* Tenchi had said.

Maybe that was the lesson of these sixteen days. Learning to listen—to the house, to the people around him, to the strange new body he inhabited and its unexpected capabilities. Accepting what came without demanding explanations. Finding his place in a story he didn't fully understand.

The stars wheeled overhead in their ancient patterns. The cedar trees whispered in the night breeze. And Sheldon Tsukino sat on the engawa of Masaki Shrine and let himself feel, for the first time in this new life, something very close to peace.

Tomorrow would bring new work, new learning, new steps forward.

For now, this moment was enough.

#### Scene 17.A: Hikaru Day

The seventeenth morning brought clear skies and the promise of completion.

Sheldon stood on the engawa of the shrine, watching the first light paint the mountain gold, and felt the peculiar weight of endings. Today, Yamada would finish the sealing. Tomorrow—or perhaps even tonight—he could move into his house. Seventeen days from waking in a field with cherry blossoms in his hair to standing on the threshold of his own home.

*Fast,* he thought. *And slow. Both at once.*

The paradox of time in this new life continued to surprise him. Each day felt full, unhurried, packed with small moments that accumulated into something larger. Yet somehow nearly three weeks had passed in what felt like a handful of breaths.

"You're thinking heavy thoughts for such an early hour."

Katsuhito's voice came from behind him, gentle and unsurprised. The old priest moved to stand beside Sheldon, his own cup of tea steaming in the cool morning air.

"Last day of preparation," Sheldon said. "Tomorrow I wake up in a different place."

"Three hundred meters away."

"It feels further."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "Transitions often do. The first night in a new home is its own kind of journey."


Breakfast passed in the familiar rhythm—Tenchi's energy, the quiet comfort of shared food, the small rituals that had become Sheldon's anchor in this unfamiliar life. But today there was an undercurrent of anticipation that even the four-year-old seemed to feel.

"When can I see the finished roof?" Tenchi asked, picking at his rice. "You said today. You said when the sealing was done."

"After school," Sheldon confirmed. "Yamada-san should be finished by early afternoon. We can walk down together."

"And then you'll live there?"

"Soon. Maybe tomorrow."

Tenchi's face performed a complex series of expressions—excitement warring with something that looked almost like worry. "But you'll still come for breakfast?"

"Every morning. We talked about this."

"I know." The boy poked at his food again. "It's just... different. It'll be different."

Sheldon reached over, resting a hand on Tenchi's shoulder. "Different isn't bad. It means things are growing. Changing. That's what living things do."

"Like plants?"

"Exactly like plants. They start as seeds, then sprouts, then bigger and bigger. Each stage is different from the one before. But they're still the same plant."

Tenchi considered this with the gravity of a philosopher examining first principles. "So you moving is like... growing a new leaf?"

"Something like that."

"Okay." The boy's expression settled into acceptance. "But I still get to help with the garden."

"The garden won't work without you."


The walk to the Tsukino house carried a different quality today—a sense of culmination that changed the familiar path into something ceremonial. Sheldon wore the work gloves Yamada had recommended, tucked into his belt, and carried a small bundle of onigiri for the midday break.

Yamada's truck was already there when he arrived, the roofer's silhouette visible on the roof edge, applying sealant with methodical precision.

"Tsukino-san!" Yamada called down. "Good timing. I'm starting the ridge cap."

"Can I help?"

"Come up. I'll show you the technique."

The ladder was steady, the roof now as familiar as the path from the shrine. Sheldon climbed with the easy confidence his body had learned, though his mind still marveled at the absence of fear. Up here, the world opened into a panorama of forested mountains, the valley below, the distant glint of what might be the river.

"The sealant goes in the joints," Yamada explained, demonstrating with his caulking gun. "Not too much—you want it to fill the gap, not overflow. The roof needs to breathe."

"Breathe?"

"Moisture. Heat. Air moves through the structure. If you seal it too tight, you trap problems instead of preventing them." Yamada handed over the caulking gun. "Try the next section."

Sheldon's hands knew what to do before his mind caught up. The pressure, the angle, the steady movement along the joint—all of it felt natural, as if he'd done this work in some other life. The sealant flowed smoothly, filling the gap with precision.

"Good," Yamada said. "You have the touch."

"Your grandmother's theory?"

A quiet laugh. "Perhaps. Or perhaps you're simply a quick learner. The result is the same."


They worked through the morning, the sun climbing higher and the temperature warming. By noon, the ridge cap was complete and they'd moved to the edges where wall met roof. The house was beginning to look not just repaired but renewed—a structure that had been waiting for attention finally receiving it.

"Break?" Yamada suggested, descending the ladder with the ease of long practice.

They sat on the engawa, sharing Sheldon's onigiri and tea from Yamada's thermos. The comfortable silence of men who had worked together and found a rhythm.

"I worked on this house with my father," Yamada said, apropos of nothing. "Thirty years ago. I was your age, maybe younger. Learning the trade."

"You've known this house that long?"

"Known it. Watched it. A roofer learns to see buildings over time—how they age, how they settle, what they need." Yamada's eyes traced the roofline with something like affection. "This one was always well-made. Strong bones. The kind of house that wants to be lived in."

"And now it will be."

"Yes." Yamada finished his rice ball, brushed his hands clean. "My father would be pleased. He always said buildings have spirits—not ghosts, but the accumulated intention of everyone who built them, lived in them, cared for them. When a house sits empty too long, that spirit grows lonely."

Sheldon thought of Sachiko Tsukino, the woman he'd never met whose name he now carried. Her parents before her. The generations of intention accumulated in these walls.

"I'll try to be worthy of it," he said.

"You already are." Yamada rose, stretching. "Another few hours and we're done. Then the spirit can welcome you properly."


It happened in the mid-afternoon, when the sealing was nearly complete and Sheldon was cleaning up tools on the ground.

A flash of orange in his peripheral vision. Movement at the edge of the overgrown garden.

He turned, expecting a bird or perhaps a tanuki—the wildlife discussion from Tenchi's kindergarten stories still fresh in his mind. Instead, he found himself looking at a cat.

An orange tabby, to be precise. Male, from the size of him—a solid, muscular build that suggested survival experience. His coat was the color of autumn leaves, marked with the distinctive stripes of his kind and the characteristic 'M' on his forehead. His eyes were gold-green, watching Sheldon with an expression that managed to be both wary and curious.

"Hello," Sheldon said quietly, not moving.

The cat's ears swiveled toward the sound but he didn't flee. Instead, he sat down at the garden's edge, wrapping his tail around his paws with the dignity of a creature who had decided this spot belonged to him.

"Friend of yours?" Yamada's voice came from the roof, amused.

"First time seeing him. Stray, I think."

"Mountain has a few. They hunt the mice that come down from the fields." Yamada descended the ladder, moving slowly to avoid startling the animal. "This one looks healthy. Someone's been feeding him, or he's a good hunter."

The cat watched Yamada's approach with the same measured attention he'd given Sheldon. Not afraid, exactly, but alert. Assessing.

"We had a piece of fish from lunch," Sheldon remembered. "In my pack."

"Ah. That might explain his interest."

Sheldon retrieved the wrapped fish—a small piece of grilled mackerel he'd set aside for later. He knelt, setting it on the ground a few feet from where the cat sat.

The orange tabby considered the offering with what Sheldon could only describe as thoughtful suspicion. Then, moving with the careful grace of his kind, he approached. One sniff. A second. Then he began to eat, unhurried, as if accepting hospitality rather than scavenging a meal.

"He likes you," Yamada observed.

"He likes mackerel."

"Same thing, to a cat."


The sealing was complete by three o'clock.

Yamada performed a final inspection, walking the perimeter and checking each joint with professional thoroughness. Sheldon followed, learning to see what the roofer saw—the places where water might try to enter, the vulnerabilities of any structure exposed to weather.

"Done," Yamada announced, satisfied. "She'll hold through any storm now."

"Thank you." The words felt inadequate. "For everything. The work, the teaching, the... philosophy."

Yamada smiled, the expression transforming his weathered face. "The house taught you. I just translated."

They shook hands—a formal gesture that felt right for the moment. Two craftsmen acknowledging completed work.

"If you have problems, call. But you won't." Yamada gathered his tools, loading them into the truck with familiar efficiency. "The bones are good. You understand the house now. She'll tell you what she needs."

The truck rumbled to life, rattling down the narrow road and disappearing into the trees.

Sheldon stood alone in front of his house—truly his now, the work complete—and felt the weight of the moment settle around him.

And at his feet, the orange tabby sat cleaning his whiskers, apparently having decided that this was an acceptable place to be.


Tenchi's arrival came in the late afternoon, the boy running down the path from the shrine with Katsuhito following at a more measured pace. His kindergarten bag bounced against his back, and his face was bright with anticipation.

"Is it done? Is the roof done? Can I see?"

"It's done," Sheldon confirmed. "Want to walk around and look?"

Tenchi was already circling the house before the question finished, his small feet sure on the uneven ground. He examined the new flashing, the sealed edges, the tiles that gleamed in the afternoon light.

"It looks new," he said, awed. "Like a new house."

"Same house. Just taken care of properly."

"Grandfather says that's what makes things last." Tenchi completed his circuit, then stopped short as he noticed the orange cat still lounging near the garden edge. "A *cat*!"

The tabby's ears flicked at the exclamation but he didn't bolt. Instead, he regarded Tenchi with the same measured assessment he'd given the adults—curious, cautious, but not afraid.

"He showed up while we were working," Sheldon explained. "A stray, I think. From the mountain."

Tenchi approached slowly, with the instinctive care of a child who understood that some creatures required patience. He crouched a few feet away, making himself smaller, less threatening.

"Hello, cat. I'm Tenchi."

The orange tabby's tail swished once. Twice. Then, with the deliberation of a creature making an important decision, he rose and walked toward the boy.

Tenchi held his breath as the cat approached, coming close enough to sniff his outstretched hand. A moment of mutual assessment. Then the tabby butted his head against Tenchi's palm, a clear invitation.

The boy's face lit up like sunrise.

"He *likes* me!"

"Apparently so."

Tenchi stroked the cat's head with careful gentleness, his fingers tracing the 'M' marking on the tabby's forehead. "What's his name?"

"He's a stray. I don't think he has one."

"Then we should give him one." Tenchi's face went serious with the gravity of the responsibility. "He's orange. Like... like fire. Or the sun."

"Good observations."

"What about... Hikaru?" The boy looked up at Sheldon, seeking approval. "It means 'light.' Because he's bright like sunshine."

Sheldon looked at the orange cat, who had settled into being petted with the boneless contentment of his kind. Hikaru. Light. A name for a creature who had appeared on the day of completion, as if summoned by the turning of a page.

"I think that's perfect," he said.

Tenchi beamed. "Hikaru," he said to the cat, testing the name. "Your name is Hikaru now."

The cat purred.


Katsuhito had observed the naming ceremony from a respectful distance. Now he approached, studying the orange tabby with the same thoughtful attention he brought to everything.

"A good omen," he said quietly. "Cats choose their homes. If this one has chosen yours, it speaks well of the house's spirit."

"Yamada said something similar. About houses having spirits."

"Yamada is wiser than he appears. Most craftsmen are." Katsuhito knelt, extending a hand for the cat to investigate. Hikaru sniffed politely, then returned his attention to Tenchi's ministrations. "Will you keep him?"

Sheldon looked at the scene before him—his house, roof whole and strong; a four-year-old boy, face bright with joy; an orange cat who had wandered out of the mountain and decided to stay.

"I think he's decided to keep me," he said.

"That is usually how it works with cats."


The sun was beginning its descent when they finally headed back to the shrine, Tenchi chattering excitedly about Hikaru, about the roof, about how maybe the cat was also a ninja because he was so quiet and appeared without warning.

Hikaru followed them partway up the path, then stopped at an invisible boundary and sat down to watch them go. He would still be there tomorrow, Sheldon somehow knew. The cat had made his choice.

At the shrine gate, Tenchi looked back and waved. "Bye, Hikaru! See you tomorrow!"

The orange cat's tail swished once in acknowledgment.

"Tomorrow," Sheldon said quietly, more to himself than anyone else. "I move in tomorrow."

Katsuhito nodded. "And so a new chapter begins."

#### Scene 17.B: Seventeenth Evening

The boy had requested it specifically, citing the importance of the occasion. "It's your last night here," he'd explained with four-year-old gravity. "We should have something special."

Sheldon hadn't pointed out that he'd be back for breakfast in less than twelve hours. The sentiment mattered more than the logistics.

So he made curry—the real kind, with roux built from scratch the way his hands now knew how to do, the spices balanced by instinct rather than measurement. Tenchi helped wash vegetables, his small fingers careful with the carrots and potatoes, his commentary a constant stream of updates on Hikaru.

"Do you think he'll be there tomorrow? What if he leaves? What if he forgets us?"

"Cats have good memories," Sheldon said. "And he chose that spot. He'll be there."

"How do you know?"

"Because that's what cats do. They find a place that feels right and they stay."

Tenchi considered this while scrubbing a potato. "Like you did. You found the shrine and you stayed."

The observation landed with unexpected weight. Sheldon paused in his stirring, looking down at the boy beside him.

"Yes," he said quietly. "I suppose I did."


The curry was good—rich and warming, the kind of meal that settled into bones and made the world feel solid. They ate together at the low table, Katsuhito offering quiet appreciation while Tenchi worked through his second bowl with determined enthusiasm.

"Hikaru will like curry," the boy announced between bites. "Cats like meat. There's meat in curry."

"Cats shouldn't eat curry," Sheldon said. "The spices aren't good for them. But we can give him plain chicken sometimes."

"Plain chicken." Tenchi nodded seriously, filing this information away. "And fish. He liked the fish today."

"He did."

"I'm going to bring him fish from my lunch. Grandfather packs fish sometimes."

Katsuhito's eyebrows rose slightly. "Does he now."

"For Hikaru. He's my cat too, right, Sheldon-san? Even though he lives at your house?"

Sheldon met Katsuhito's eyes across the table. The old priest's expression held something that might have been amusement, or perhaps something deeper.

"He's our cat," Sheldon said. "The whole family's."

Tenchi beamed. "I've never had a cat before. Grandfather said cats find their own people and you can't make them stay if they don't want to. But Hikaru wants to stay. I could tell."

"How could you tell?"

"He purred." The boy's certainty was absolute. "Cats only purr when they're happy. He was happy with us."


The evening routine carried a different weight tonight—the last iteration of a pattern about to change. Tenchi's bath, the quiet hour of wind-down, the request for a story that Sheldon suspected was as much about delay as entertainment.

"Tell me about the house," Tenchi said, already curled against Sheldon's side. "About what it'll be like when you live there."

"What do you want to know?"

"Everything. What will you do in the morning? What will you eat? Where will Hikaru sleep?"

Sheldon considered the questions, painting a picture with words. "In the morning, I'll wake up and make tea. Then I'll walk up the path to the shrine for breakfast with you and your grandfather. After that, I'll work on the house—cleaning, repairing small things, getting the garden ready for planting."

"And I'll help with the garden."

"You'll help with the garden. We'll plant vegetables together. Tomatoes, maybe. Cucumbers. Whatever grows well here."

"Grandmother grew tomatoes." Tenchi's voice was soft. "Grandfather told me. She had a garden with tomatoes and herbs and flowers."

Sheldon felt the familiar ache that came with mentions of the family whose name he carried. "Then we'll grow tomatoes. In her memory."

"And Hikaru will watch us work. Cats like to watch."

"They do."

Tenchi yawned, the sound stretching into something that was almost a purr itself. "I'm glad you're staying, Sheldon-san. Even if you're staying in a different place."

"I'm glad too."

"And I'm glad Hikaru came. It's like... like the house was waiting for both of you. And now you're both here."

The words hung in the quiet room, simple and profound in the way only children's observations could be. Sheldon stroked the boy's hair, feeling the slow rhythm of Tenchi's breathing as sleep began to claim him.

"Maybe it was," he said softly. "Maybe we were all waiting for each other."


Later, after Katsuhito had carried the sleeping boy to bed, Sheldon stood on the engawa one last time as a guest.

The stars were out in force, the Milky Way a pale river across the darkness. The same stars he'd watched on his first night here, confused and lost and uncertain of everything. Now he knew their patterns, recognized the constellations that wheeled overhead, felt the rhythm of the mountain's nights in his bones.

*Seventeen days,* he thought. *Tomorrow, eighteen. And everything changes again.*

But change, he was learning, wasn't the same as loss. The shrine would still be here. The path would still connect his house to this place. The people who had welcomed him—the old priest with his quiet wisdom, the small boy with his enormous heart—they weren't going anywhere.

*Family isn't just the people who live under your roof,* he thought. *It's the people who hold space for you. Who expect you to come back.*

Katsuhito appeared silently, as he often did, settling onto the engawa beside Sheldon.

"Last night," the old priest observed.

"Last night as a guest. First of many nights as a neighbor."

"A good distinction." Katsuhito was quiet for a moment, watching the stars. "The boy will miss having you in the next room. But he understands. He's already planning his visits."

"I know. He told me about the fish."

A soft sound that might have been a laugh. "He's been planning that since we left your house. The logistics of cat-feeding are apparently quite complex."

"Apparently."

They sat in comfortable silence, two men watching the stars turn overhead. The night air was cool but not cold, carrying the scent of cedar and the first hints of spring warmth.

"Thank you," Sheldon said finally. "For everything. The room, the meals, the... acceptance. You didn't have to welcome a stranger into your home."

"You weren't a stranger." Katsuhito's voice was certain. "Not from the moment I saw you on that path. Some people belong in certain places. It's obvious, when you know how to look."

"Like cats choosing their homes?"

"Exactly like that." The old priest rose, moving toward the door. "Sleep well, Tsukino-san. Tomorrow you begin a new chapter. But the story continues."

"Goodnight, Katsuhito-san."

"Goodnight."


Sheldon stayed on the engawa a while longer, watching the stars and listening to the night sounds of the mountain. Somewhere down the slope, three hundred meters away, his house waited. And at its garden edge, an orange cat named Hikaru was probably curled in whatever shelter strays found for themselves, waiting for morning.

*Tomorrow,* he thought. *Tomorrow it all becomes real.*

He carried that thought with him into sleep—the last sleep in the guest room of Masaki Shrine, the final night of his first chapter in this new life.

Tomorrow, a new chapter would begin.

#### Scene 18.A: Move In Day

The eighteenth morning began like all the others—and nothing like them at all.

Sheldon woke in the guest room of Masaki Shrine for the last time, watching the familiar play of early light on the ceiling. The same cedar beams. The same soft creak of old wood settling. The same distant birdsong filtering through the paper screens.

But today, everything was different. Today, he would wake up here and sleep somewhere else. The symmetry of that thought—arriving at dawn, departing for good—felt significant in a way he couldn't quite articulate.

*Eighteen days,* he thought. *Eighteen days from waking in a field to waking in... my life.*

He rose, folded the futon with care, and stood for a moment in the empty room. The space had been his sanctuary, his transition point, his introduction to this new existence. It had welcomed him when he had nothing—not even certainty about who he was. Now he was leaving it behind.

"Thank you," he said quietly, to the room or the house or perhaps to himself. Then he slid open the door and walked toward breakfast.


The meal was quieter than usual.

Tenchi ate with uncharacteristic focus, his eyes tracking Sheldon's movements as if memorizing them. Katsuhito maintained his usual calm, but there was something in the set of his shoulders that spoke of awareness—the recognition of a threshold being crossed.

"You'll come back for breakfast," Tenchi said, more statement than question.

"Every morning. We talked about this."

"I know." The boy pushed rice around his bowl. "It's just... I wanted to hear you say it again."

Sheldon reached across and rested a hand on Tenchi's shoulder. "Every morning. And you'll come visit after school. And we'll work on the garden together. Nothing important is changing, Tenchi. Just the place where I sleep."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi's face relaxed slightly. He attacked his breakfast with renewed vigor, as if the verbal contract had settled something that had been worrying at him.

Katsuhito caught Sheldon's eye across the table. The old priest nodded once—acknowledgment, approval, something deeper than words could carry.


There wasn't much to move.

Sheldon had arrived in this life with nothing but the clothes on his back and the contents of his wallet. Over eighteen days, he'd accumulated a modest collection: a few changes of clothes purchased in the village, basic toiletries, a small stack of books Katsuhito had lent him, the work gloves that now bore the marks of roof work.

It all fit into a single canvas bag that Katsuhito produced from somewhere in the shrine's depths.

"It belonged to my son," the old priest said, handing it over. "He hasn't needed it in many years. I think he would want you to have it."

Sheldon took the bag carefully, feeling the weight of the offering. Another thread connecting him to the family whose periphery he now inhabited. Another piece of history woven into his present.

"Thank you. I'll take care of it."

"I know you will."


The walk down the mountain felt ceremonial.

Three hundred meters of familiar path, the same route he'd traveled dozens of times in the past eighteen days. But today each step carried weight. Today he wasn't visiting his house—he was going home.

The cedars whispered overhead in the morning breeze. Sunlight filtered through in golden shafts, dappling the packed earth of the path. Somewhere above, a bird sang its territorial claim to the day.

And there, at the edge of the overgrown garden, an orange shape waited.

Hikaru sat exactly where Sheldon had last seen him—as if he'd been stationed there overnight, keeping watch over the house until its owner returned. The cat's tail swished once in greeting, but he didn't rise. He simply observed as Sheldon approached, those gold-green eyes steady and unblinking.

"Good morning," Sheldon said. "I'm moving in today. I hope that meets with your approval."

Hikaru's tail swished again. He blinked slowly—the feline equivalent, Sheldon suspected, of a nod.

"I'll take that as a yes."


The house smelled of cedar and dust and something older—the accumulated scent of decades, of the family who had built these walls and lived within them. Sheldon set down his bag in the main room and stood for a moment, breathing it in.

This was his now. Not borrowed, not temporary, not contingent. His.

The thought was terrifying and wonderful in equal measure.

He spent the morning cleaning—sweeping floors, airing out rooms, clearing cobwebs from corners that had been neglected during the empty years. The work was satisfying in a way that transcended the physical results. Each stroke of the broom, each opened window, each layer of dust removed felt like a declaration. *This is my home. I am taking care of it.*

Hikaru followed him through the house, investigating each room with the thoroughness of a building inspector. The cat seemed to approve of the cleaning efforts, settling into various spots to observe before moving on to supervise the next area.

"You're very particular," Sheldon told him during a break, sitting on the engawa with tea he'd made on the small stove. "Is this up to your standards?"

Hikaru, stretched in a patch of sunlight, deigned to purr.

"I'll take that as a qualified yes."


The afternoon brought visitors.

Tenchi appeared on the path from the shrine at precisely the time kindergarten would have ended, running with the boundless energy of a four-year-old freed from obligation. His grandfather followed at a more measured pace, carrying a bundle wrapped in cloth.

"I came to visit!" Tenchi announced, slightly out of breath. "Just like you said! Is Hikaru here? Did you clean? Can I see your room? Where's Hikaru?"

"Slow down." Sheldon laughed, catching the boy as he careened into his legs. "Hikaru is in the garden. I've been cleaning. You can see everything."

The tour that followed was perhaps the most thorough inspection the house had ever received. Tenchi examined every room with solemn attention, offering commentary that ranged from the practical ("This room is smaller than your room at the shrine") to the philosophical ("The wood here sounds different when you walk on it—can wood have different voices?").

Hikaru, apparently sensing that his presence was requested, emerged from whatever garden hiding spot he'd claimed and submitted to Tenchi's enthusiastic greeting with the patience of a creature who had decided this small human was acceptable.

"I brought him fish," Tenchi said, producing a small wrapped packet from his pocket with the triumph of a magician revealing his best trick. "From my lunch. I saved it special."

The fish was slightly warm and smelled strongly of the schoolday it had survived, but Hikaru approached with evident interest. He sniffed, considered, then accepted the offering with the gravity of a lord receiving tribute.

"He likes it!" Tenchi's face glowed. "Grandfather, did you see? He liked my fish!"

"I saw." Katsuhito had settled onto the engawa, the wrapped bundle beside him. "You've made a friend for life. Cats never forget who feeds them."


The bundle, when unwrapped, proved to be a collection of essential items that Katsuhito had apparently decided Sheldon would need: a set of dishes, a teapot with two cups, a small knife of obvious quality, and a hand-sized wooden carving of a seated cat that looked remarkably like Hikaru.

"Housewarming gifts," Katsuhito explained. "The dishes are simple, but serviceable. The teapot belonged to my wife—she would have wanted someone to use it. The knife is for cooking. And the cat..."

"It's Hikaru!" Tenchi grabbed the carving, examining it with wonder. "Grandfather, you made Hikaru!"

"I carved it this morning, while you were at school. Every house needs a guardian spirit. This one can watch over Sheldon's home until the real one decides to come inside."

Sheldon turned the carving over in his hands. The work was exquisite—far beyond simple craft. Every detail of Hikaru's pose had been captured: the alert ears, the tucked paws, the somehow-smug expression of a cat who knew his worth.

"This is... you made this in a few hours?"

"I've had practice." Katsuhito's eyes held that gleam of hidden amusement. "Seven hundred years gives a man time to develop his hobbies."

Sheldon blinked. "Seven hundred...?"

"A joke." The old priest's smile was serene. "I'm told my sense of humor takes some getting used to."


They stayed for dinner.

Sheldon cooked—the first meal prepared in his own kitchen, in his own home. Nothing elaborate: miso soup, rice, grilled fish, pickled vegetables. Simple food, made with care, served to the people who had made this new life possible.

The small table in the main room barely fit three, but the crowding felt right. Tenchi pressed close to Sheldon's side, chattering about his day, about Hikaru, about the garden they would plant. Katsuhito ate with quiet appreciation, offering occasional observations that ranged from the mundane to the unexpectedly profound.

"The food tastes different here," Tenchi observed. "Even though it's the same food."

"The cook's state of mind affects the meal," Katsuhito said. "Your mother used to say that. Food made with intention carries that intention to the eater."

Sheldon paused with his chopsticks halfway to his mouth. "That's... surprisingly specific."

"Kiyone was a wise woman. She understood many things that I'm still learning."

The name hung in the air—Tenchi's mother, gone but not forgotten, present in the small rituals and remembered wisdom that shaped this family. Sheldon felt the weight of it, the responsibility of stepping into spaces that grief had carved.

"I'll try to cook with good intentions," he said quietly.

"You already do." Katsuhito's eyes met his. "That's why the food tastes the way it does."


The evening came too quickly.

Katsuhito collected Tenchi when the boy's energy finally flagged, lifting the drowsy child with practiced ease. Tenchi murmured protests that faded into silence as sleep claimed him.

"Thank you," Sheldon said, standing at the door. "For everything. The gifts, the help, the... everything."

"We're neighbors now." Katsuhito shifted Tenchi's weight against his shoulder. "Neighbors help each other. It's not charity—it's community."

"Still."

"Still." The old priest nodded. "Sleep well, Tsukino-san. Your first night in your own home. Try not to let the significance keep you awake."

"I'll do my best."

He watched them climb the path until the darkness swallowed them, Katsuhito's white robes the last thing visible before they disappeared among the cedars. Then he turned back to his house—his home—and closed the door.


The first night was quieter than Sheldon had expected.

The house settled around him with small sounds—creaks and sighs that might have been alarming in a different context but felt almost welcoming now. This building had stood for decades, sheltering generations. It knew how to hold someone safely through the darkness.

He spread his futon in the main room—the smaller bedroom would need more work before it was truly habitable—and lay watching the moonlight filter through the windows. The moon was nearly full tonight, bright enough to cast shadows on the tatami.

Hikaru appeared from somewhere, padding silently across the floor to investigate the sleeping arrangements. After a thorough sniffing inspection, the cat apparently decided that Sheldon's feet were an acceptable proximity. He curled into a tight orange spiral and began to purr.

"First night," Sheldon said quietly. "We made it."

The purring continued, steady and somehow reassuring. Outside, an owl called its hunting cry. The cedar trees whispered secrets to each other. And somewhere up the mountain, three hundred meters away, a small boy slept in the room next to his grandfather's, probably dreaming of cats and fish and gardens.

*Eighteen days,* Sheldon thought. *From waking in a field to sleeping in my own home. From having nothing to having... this.*

Family. Community. Purpose. A house that wanted to be lived in and a cat who had chosen to stay.

It wasn't the life he'd had before—whatever that life had been, however it had ended. It was something new. Something he was building, day by day, choice by choice, meal by meal.

The moon moved across the sky. Hikaru's purring slowed into sleep-breathing. And Sheldon Tsukino, in his own home for the first time, finally closed his eyes and let the darkness hold him.

He slept without dreams.

#### Scene 19.A: Nineteenth Day

The nineteenth morning began with birdsong and the smell of cedar.

Sheldon opened his eyes to unfamiliar ceiling beams—darker than the ones at the shrine, older somehow, with the patina of decades. For a moment, disorientation fluttered through him. Then memory caught up: his house, his first night, his new beginning.

Hikaru was still curled at his feet, a warm orange weight that hadn't moved since settling in the night before. The cat's eyes opened as Sheldon stirred, gold-green and knowing.

"Good morning," Sheldon said quietly.

Hikaru stretched with the elaborate slowness of his kind, extending each leg in turn, yawning to display an impressive array of teeth. Then he padded across the futon and butted his head against Sheldon's hand—demanding acknowledgment, or perhaps simply saying hello in the way cats did.

"I'll take that as 'good morning' back."


The walk to the shrine felt different today.

Not the path itself—that remained unchanged, the same packed earth and towering cedars, the same play of morning light through the canopy. But Sheldon's relationship to it had shifted. Yesterday, he'd walked this path as someone leaving. Today, he walked it as someone who would return.

*Home,* he thought, testing the word. *I'm walking from home.*

The concept still felt new, fragile, like a seedling just broken through soil. But it was real now in a way it hadn't been before. He had a place. A foundation. Somewhere to come back to.

At the shrine gate, Tenchi was waiting.

"Sheldon-san! You came!"

"I promised I would."

"I know, but—" The boy caught himself, grinning sheepishly. "I wanted to see if it felt different. You coming from your house instead of from the guest room."

"Does it?"

Tenchi considered the question with gravity. "A little. You smell different."

"I... smell different?"

"Like wood. Different wood. The shrine wood smells one way, and your house wood smells another way. Now you smell like your house."

Sheldon found himself laughing—a genuine sound that surprised him with its ease. "I suppose I do. Houses do have their own scents."

"Grandfather says houses remember everyone who lives in them. The smells get into the wood and stay forever."

"Your grandfather is very wise about houses."

"He's wise about everything." Tenchi grabbed Sheldon's hand, tugging him toward the residence. "Come on, breakfast is almost ready. I helped make the rice."


Breakfast at the shrine carried a new quality—subtle but unmistakable.

The food was the same: rice, miso soup, grilled fish, pickled vegetables. The table was the same, the cushions, the morning light slanting through the screens. But Sheldon's position had changed. He was a guest now in a way he hadn't been before—welcomed, expected, but no longer a resident.

Katsuhito seemed to sense the shift. His manner was as warm as ever, but there was a formality underneath it now, a recognition of boundaries that hadn't existed before.

"How was your first night?" the old priest asked.

"Quiet. Peaceful. Hikaru kept watch."

"Cats are good at that. They see things we miss."

Tenchi looked up from his rice. "What kind of things?"

"Small things. Movement in shadows. The settling of a house." Katsuhito's eyes held that familiar glint of hidden knowledge. "Cats notice what others overlook."

"Is that why they stare at walls sometimes? Are they seeing secret things?"

"Perhaps. Or perhaps they simply like staring at walls. Cats are mysterious creatures."


After breakfast, Tenchi departed for school with the reluctance of a child who had better things to do than learn. Sheldon walked him to the point where the path split—one branch leading to the village, the other down to the Tsukino house.

"Tomorrow is Saturday," Tenchi said. "No school. I can come help with the garden."

"That would be good. We should start planning what to plant."

"Tomatoes. You promised tomatoes."

"I did. And cucumbers, and whatever else grows well here."

"And a space for Hikaru to sit and watch. Cats like watching gardens."

"A cat-watching space. I'll make sure to include that in the plans."

Tenchi grinned, satisfied with the concession, and continued down toward the village with the bounce of a child anticipating weekend freedom.


The day passed in quiet productivity.

Sheldon returned to his house and set about the work of making it truly his. The main room was livable now, but the smaller bedroom needed attention—dust and cobwebs had accumulated during the years of emptiness, and the tatami showed signs of age that might require eventual replacement.

He cleaned methodically, finding satisfaction in the physical labor. Each swept corner, each wiped surface, each opened window felt like a small victory. The house was waking up, shaking off the lethargy of abandonment, remembering what it meant to shelter someone.

Hikaru supervised from various vantage points, offering silent judgment on the quality of the work. Occasionally he would investigate a newly cleaned area, sniffing corners and checking behind furniture with the thoroughness of an inspector. His apparent approval—expressed through a lack of visible disapproval—felt oddly validating.

"You're very particular," Sheldon told him during a mid-morning break. "Were you always this demanding, or is it something about this house?"

Hikaru's tail swished once. He began grooming his paw with studied disinterest.

"I'll take that as 'I've always been this way.'"


In the afternoon, Sheldon turned his attention to the garden.

The plot behind the house had clearly been tended once—the bones of raised beds were still visible beneath the overgrowth, and here and there, hardy plants had survived the years of neglect. Wild mint grew in one corner, its sharp scent rising when Sheldon brushed past. Something that might have been oregano occupied another patch, gone leggy and sprawling but still alive.

*Sachiko's garden,* he thought. *Or her parents' before her. Generations of intention, layered in the soil.*

He began clearing the worst of the weeds, working by hand without tools. The earth was rich and dark, well-composted by years of fallen leaves. Good soil. Ready soil. Waiting for someone to remember what it could become.

The work was meditative—bend, pull, shake loose the dirt, set aside. His hands knew the rhythm even if his mind didn't remember learning it. Another of those strange competencies that seemed to live in his body without explanation.

*Don't question it,* he reminded himself. *Accept it. Use it well.*

By late afternoon, he'd cleared one full bed and started on a second. His back ached pleasantly, his hands were filthy, and something in his chest felt lighter than it had in days.


Tenchi appeared on the path just as Sheldon was finishing for the day, the boy's school bag bouncing against his back and his face bright with Friday energy.

"You started without me!"

"Just the clearing. The planting we'll do together."

Tenchi surveyed the cleared bed with the critical eye of a four-year-old expert. "It looks good. The dirt is very brown."

"That's a good sign. Brown dirt has lots of nutrients."

"What are nutrients?"

"Food for plants. Like how we eat rice and fish, plants eat things from the soil. Good brown dirt means lots of plant food."

"Oh." Tenchi nodded, filing this information away. "So we're making dinner for the tomatoes."

"In a way, yes."

The boy circled the cleared bed, pausing to examine the wild mint Sheldon had spared. "What's this? It smells... sharp."

"Mint. It was already growing here, so I left it. Someone planted it a long time ago."

"Grandmother?"

"Maybe. Or her parents. Gardens remember the people who tend them, just like houses do."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, processing this. Then: "So when we plant tomatoes, the garden will remember us?"

"It will."

"Forever?"

"For as long as the garden is here."

The boy smiled—a soft, thoughtful expression that made him look older than his four years. "I like that. Being remembered by a garden."


Dinner that evening was simple: rice, soup, and vegetables from the shrine's stores that Katsuhito had sent down with Tenchi. They ate together in Sheldon's main room, the small space warm with shared presence.

"Father is coming tomorrow," Tenchi announced between bites.

Sheldon paused. "Your father?"

"Yes. He visits on Saturdays sometimes. Grandfather said he's coming tomorrow to meet you."

The information settled with unexpected weight. Nobuyuki—Tenchi's father, Katsuhito's son. The owner of the canvas bag that now held Sheldon's belongings. A thread in the family web that Sheldon hadn't yet encountered.

"What's he like?" Sheldon asked. "Your father?"

Tenchi considered the question carefully. "He's tall. And he works in the city, so he wears suits. He laughs a lot, but sometimes his eyes look sad when he thinks I'm not watching." The boy poked at his rice. "He misses Mother. I can tell."

"That's understandable. Losing someone you love leaves marks."

"Grandfather says time helps, but the marks never go away completely. They just become part of you."

Sheldon thought of his own marks—the loss he couldn't quite name, the life he'd had before this one that existed only as echoes and absences. "Your grandfather is right."

"He usually is." Tenchi brightened slightly. "But Father will like you. I told him about you in my letters. About how you cook and help with the shrine and found Hikaru. He said he wants to thank you."

"Thank me for what?"

"For being here." Tenchi's voice was matter-of-fact, as if this were obvious. "Grandfather needed someone. And so did I."


Later, after Tenchi had returned to the shrine and the evening settled into darkness, Sheldon sat on his engawa and watched the stars emerge.

Hikaru had claimed the spot beside him, stretched along the wooden boards with the boneless relaxation of a creature who had decided this was home. The cat's purr was a low rumble, constant and somehow comforting.

*Tomorrow I meet Nobuyuki,* Sheldon thought. *Another piece of this family. Another relationship to navigate.*

He wasn't nervous, exactly. But there was awareness—the recognition that fathers were protective creatures, that strangers appearing in their children's lives warranted scrutiny. Whatever Tenchi had written in his letters, Nobuyuki would need to form his own judgments.

*I'll just be myself,* Sheldon decided. *Whatever that means now.*

The stars wheeled overhead. The cedar trees whispered their ancient secrets. And in his own home, on his own engawa, with his own cat purring beside him, Sheldon Tsukino waited for tomorrow to arrive.

#### Scene 20.A: Nobuyuki Visit

The twentieth morning brought anticipation.

Sheldon woke with awareness humming beneath his skin—not anxiety, exactly, but heightened attention. Today he would meet Nobuyuki Masaki. Tenchi's father. Katsuhito's son. The man whose canvas bag now held Sheldon's belongings, whose wife's wisdom about food and intention had already become part of Sheldon's understanding of this family.

*First impressions matter,* he thought, rising from his futon. *But so does authenticity. Be yourself. Whoever that is.*

Hikaru stretched from his spot at the foot of the bedding, offering the morning's first purr. The cat had settled into the rhythm of the house with remarkable ease, as if he'd always lived here and was simply allowing Sheldon to share the space.

"Big day," Sheldon told him. "We're being evaluated."

Hikaru's expression suggested that he, personally, had already passed any evaluation that mattered.


Breakfast at the shrine carried an undercurrent of excitement that radiated primarily from Tenchi.

"Father's train arrives at ten-thirty," the boy reported, practically vibrating. "Grandfather and I will walk to the station to meet him, and then we'll all come back together, and then we can show him the house and the garden and Hikaru and—"

"Breathe," Katsuhito suggested mildly.

Tenchi paused, took an exaggerated breath, and continued at slightly reduced velocity. "—and you can cook something because Father said he's heard about your cooking and wants to try it."

Sheldon's eyebrows rose. "He's heard about my cooking?"

"I told him in my letters. I tell him everything important." Tenchi's tone suggested this should have been obvious. "Your cooking is very important. It's the best cooking."

"That's... high praise."

"It's true." The boy attacked his rice with renewed enthusiasm, the matter apparently settled.

Across the table, Katsuhito's eyes held that familiar glint of amusement. "My son has been curious about the stranger who appeared on our mountain. Tenchi's letters have made him more curious, not less."

"Should I be worried?"

"Nobuyuki is protective of his son. As any father should be." Katsuhito paused, considering. "But he is also fair. He judges people by their actions, not their origins."

*That's good,* Sheldon thought, *since my origins would be rather difficult to explain.*


The morning passed in preparation.

Sheldon returned to his house after breakfast to clean, organize, and ensure everything was presentable for inspection. The main room was tidy, the smaller bedroom still in progress but at least swept. The garden showed the first signs of intentional work—cleared beds, spared herbs, the promise of future growth.

He considered what to cook. Something impressive but not ostentatious. Something that honored the ingredients rather than showing off technique. Something that said *I belong here* without saying *I'm trying to prove I belong here*.

In the end, he settled on simplicity: a proper lunch spread of onigiri, grilled fish, pickled vegetables, and clear soup. Food that any Japanese household might serve. Food that would taste better than it looked because that was how his hands worked now—intention translating into flavor without conscious effort.

*Kiyone's philosophy,* he thought as he shaped the rice. *Food made with intention carries that intention to the eater.*

He wondered what she would have thought of him, this woman he'd never met whose wisdom had become his guide. What would she have made of a stranger appearing from nowhere to become part of her family's story?


The knock came just after noon.

Sheldon opened the door to find them waiting: Katsuhito standing with his usual serene composure, Tenchi bouncing with barely contained energy, and between them—

Nobuyuki Masaki was tall, as Tenchi had described. But the word didn't capture him. He had the lean build of a man who worked with his hands as well as his mind, the slightly rumpled look of someone who cared more about substance than appearance, and eyes that were sharp with intelligence despite the warm smile on his face.

*He has Tenchi's smile,* Sheldon realized. *Or rather, Tenchi has his.*

"Tsukino-san." Nobuyuki bowed, formal but not stiff. "I've heard a great deal about you. Thank you for welcoming us."

"Thank you for coming." Sheldon returned the bow, matching depth and duration. "Please, come in. I've prepared lunch."


The meal served as introduction.

They gathered around the small table in Sheldon's main room, knees almost touching in the cramped space. Tenchi sat pressed against his father's side, one hand occasionally reaching up to touch Nobuyuki's arm as if confirming his presence. The gesture was unconscious, automatic—a child reassuring himself that the parent was real and here and not about to disappear.

*He doesn't see his father often enough,* Sheldon thought. *Weekend visits aren't the same as daily presence.*

The food, when served, drew appreciative silence.

"Tenchi wasn't exaggerating," Nobuyuki said after his first bite of rice. "This is exceptional."

"Thank you. It's simple food."

"Simple food well-made is harder than complex food adequately made. Anyone can hide mediocrity behind technique. You can't hide it behind rice and fish."

Sheldon recognized the observation for what it was: an architect's understanding of fundamentals. A man who built things knew that foundations mattered more than ornamentation.

"Your son tells me you work in design."

"Architecture. Commercial and residential, though residential is where my heart lies." Nobuyuki's eyes moved around the room, professional assessment evident in his gaze. "This house has good bones. Traditional construction, solid craftsmanship. The roof work is recent?"

"Yamada-san finished it a few days ago."

"Kenji Yamada? I know his work. My father hired him years ago for some restoration at the shrine." Nobuyuki nodded appreciatively. "You chose well. Or rather, you were fortunate that he was available."

"Fortunate seems to be a theme in my life recently."

The words came out before Sheldon could consider them. Nobuyuki's eyes sharpened slightly, but his expression remained friendly.

"Tenchi mentioned you arrived... unexpectedly."

*Carefully now.* "I inherited this house from a distant relative. The circumstances of my arrival were unusual, but I've been grateful for your father's welcome."

"My father rarely does anything without reason." Nobuyuki's tone was light, but his eyes held weight. "If he's welcomed you, it means he sees something in you that merits welcoming."

"I hope to prove worthy of his judgment."

"From what I've seen today, you're already doing that."


After lunch, Tenchi demanded a tour of the garden.

The boy led his father around the property with proprietary pride, pointing out the cleared beds, the surviving herbs, the spot designated for tomatoes. Nobuyuki followed with the patient attention of a parent accustomed to these enthusiastic presentations, asking questions that showed genuine interest.

"And this is where Hikaru sits when he watches us work," Tenchi explained, gesturing to a patch of sun-warmed earth. "Cats like to watch gardens. Sheldon-san says so."

"Does he?" Nobuyuki glanced at Sheldon. "You know cats well?"

"I'm learning. Hikaru has been an excellent teacher."

As if summoned, the orange tabby emerged from wherever he'd been lurking, approaching the group with studied casualness. He sniffed Nobuyuki's offered hand, considered, and apparently decided the newcomer was acceptable. A head-butt against Nobuyuki's palm sealed the verdict.

"He likes you!" Tenchi beamed. "That means you're good. Hikaru only likes good people."

"High praise from a discerning judge," Nobuyuki said, scratching behind the cat's ears. "Where did he come from?"

"He appeared the day the roof was finished," Sheldon explained. "A stray from the mountain. He decided to stay."

"Cats don't stay where they're not wanted. If he's claimed this place, it means the house has a welcoming spirit." Nobuyuki's voice was matter-of-fact, as if he were discussing building codes rather than metaphysics. "My wife used to say that. She believed houses had personalities."

*Kiyone.* The name hung unspoken in the air.

"Your father mentioned her wisdom about food," Sheldon said carefully. "About intention carrying through to the eater."

Nobuyuki's expression flickered—grief surfacing, then controlled. "She had many wisdoms. I'm still discovering them, even now. Finding pieces of her in unexpected places."

Tenchi had wandered toward the garden, chasing Hikaru toward the mint patch. His laughter floated back, bright and uncomplicated.

"He seems happy here," Nobuyuki said quietly, watching his son. "The letters have been different these past weeks. More alive. He writes about you constantly."

"He's a remarkable child."

"He is." Nobuyuki turned to face Sheldon directly. "My son lost his mother when he was not quite two. He's grown up loved—my father ensures that—but he's grown up without... without certain things. Younger energy. Someone to keep up with his questions. Someone who sees the world with wonder instead of having already catalogued it."

Sheldon understood what was being said. "You think I provide that."

"I think you might. I think my father thinks so too, or he wouldn't have let you become part of Tenchi's life so quickly." Nobuyuki's eyes were steady, evaluating but not hostile. "I'm not here to challenge that judgment. I'm here to understand it. To see for myself what kind of man has entered my son's world."

"And what have you concluded?"

A long pause. The garden rustled in a light breeze. Tenchi's laughter mixed with Hikaru's indignant meow—some game had apparently involved an unwilling feline participant.

"I've concluded," Nobuyuki said finally, "that Tenchi was right. Your cooking is exceptional. And that my father's judgment, as always, is sound."

The tension Sheldon hadn't realized he was holding released. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. I'll be visiting regularly. Watching. Making sure this continues to be good for my son." The words were firm but not threatening. "That's what fathers do."

"I would expect nothing less."


The afternoon continued with easier energy.

Katsuhito had remained on the engawa during the garden tour, observing without interfering. Now he joined the conversation as they gathered for tea, contributing observations and gentle humor in equal measure. The dynamics became clearer as Sheldon watched: Nobuyuki deferring to his father on matters of tradition while asserting himself on practical concerns, Katsuhito allowing his son independence while maintaining quiet guidance.

*A family learning to function around absence,* Sheldon thought. *Kiyone's ghost in every interaction, shaping things by not being there.*

Tenchi, oblivious to the adult undercurrents, provided continuous entertainment. He demanded attention, demanded participation, demanded that his father see everything he'd discovered and learned and accumulated over the past three weeks. The constant reporting was exhausting to witness but clearly nourishing to Nobuyuki, who absorbed each detail like a man drinking after long thirst.

*He misses his son as much as Tenchi misses him. Weekend visits aren't enough for either of them.*

The thought carried weight. Geography and profession had separated this family, with Katsuhito serving as anchor while the others circled in widening orbits. Sheldon's arrival had added a new element—not replacing anything, but filling spaces that had gone unfilled.

*Is that what I am? A space-filler? Or something more?*

He didn't know. But watching Nobuyuki's careful attention and Katsuhito's quiet approval and Tenchi's unguarded joy, he suspected the answer mattered less than the living of it.


Dinner was a collaboration.

Sheldon cooked the main dishes while Nobuyuki handled rice—not trusting anyone else with the task, he admitted, because his late wife had taught him exactly how she liked it and he couldn't bear to eat it any other way. The confession was offered casually, but Sheldon heard the love underneath it. A man holding onto his wife through ritual, keeping her alive in the small acts she'd once performed.

"Kiyone was particular about rice," Katsuhito confirmed from his spot at the table. "She said it was the foundation of the meal. Get the foundation wrong, nothing else matters."

"An architect's daughter," Nobuyuki said, smiling. "She applied design principles to everything. Even cooking."

"Is that where you learned?" Sheldon asked. "Architecture, I mean. From her family?"

"From her father, yes. He saw something in me—potential, or maybe just enthusiasm. Trained me from barely out of school. I owe him my career." Nobuyuki's hands moved automatically through the rice-washing rhythm. "I owe him everything, really. Including Kiyone."

The admission hung in the air, intimate and exposed. Sheldon let it settle without comment, understanding that some words needed space to breathe.


After dinner, as darkness gathered outside, Nobuyuki prepared to catch the late train back to the city.

"Tenchi's birthday is Monday," he said, shrugging into his coat. "I'll return Friday evening and stay through the celebration. There will be cake."

"I want a big cake," Tenchi interjected. "With five candles. Because I'll be five."

"Five candles," Nobuyuki confirmed. "And presents. Several presents."

"What kind of presents?"

"The kind that five-year-olds like. You'll have to wait and see."

Tenchi's face suggested that waiting was an unreasonable expectation but one he would tolerate under duress.

At the door, Nobuyuki paused. He looked at Sheldon with an expression that had evolved over the course of the day—from cautious evaluation to something approaching genuine warmth.

"Thank you," he said. "For the meals. For your patience with my questions. For..." He glanced at Tenchi, who was attempting to attach himself to his father's leg. "For being here. For whatever reason you came, wherever you came from. Thank you for being here."

"Thank you for trusting me with him."

"Trust is earned. You're in the process of earning it." Nobuyuki smiled—Tenchi's smile, aged and weathered but still bright. "Keep cooking. Keep being present. Keep being whoever it is you're becoming."

He bent to hug his son, a long embrace that Tenchi clung to with desperate affection. Then he straightened, nodded to his father, and walked into the darkness toward the village and the train that would carry him back to his other life.

Tenchi watched until the sound of footsteps faded entirely.

"He'll be back," Sheldon said quietly.

"I know." The boy's voice was small. "He always comes back. But the going-away part is hard."

"It is."

Sheldon didn't offer false comfort—no claims that it would get easier, no promises about time healing all wounds. Instead, he simply stood beside Tenchi in the doorway, two people watching darkness swallow someone they cared about, and waited for the moment to pass.


Later, after Tenchi had been escorted back to the shrine and the night had fully fallen, Sheldon sat on his engawa with Hikaru and considered the day.

*Twenty days,* he thought. *And now I've met the full family. The old priest. The young child. The working father. A constellation of grief and love and duty, orbiting around an absence.*

He understood his place now, or at least understood it better. He was the unexpected variable—the stranger who'd arrived and stayed, who filled gaps without trying to replace what had been lost. A support structure rather than a foundation. A branch added to a tree that had been growing long before he appeared.

*Is that enough?* he wondered. *Being a branch? Being useful without being essential?*

The stars offered no answers. But Hikaru's purr was steady, and somewhere up the mountain, a four-year-old boy was probably dreaming of birthday cake and presents, and in two days that boy would turn five.

Two days. Then a birthday. Then whatever came after.

The story continued. And Sheldon Tsukino was part of it now, for better or worse, for as long as he was allowed to stay.

#### Scene 21.A: Birthday Eve

The twenty-first morning arrived with the particular energy of a day before something important.

Sheldon felt it the moment he woke—an anticipatory hum that seemed to fill the house, as if even the old wooden beams understood that tomorrow mattered. Tenchi's fifth birthday. A milestone in any child's life, but especially significant in this household where milestones had been marked by absence as often as celebration.

Hikaru, immune to human anticipation, yawned and stretched with feline indifference. The cat had opinions about many things, but calendars were not among them.

"You're right," Sheldon told him. "One day at a time. But today, we prepare."


Breakfast at the shrine confirmed the prevailing mood.

Tenchi was vibrating at a frequency that seemed barely compatible with sitting still. He'd woken early, according to Katsuhito—before dawn, unable to contain the excitement of being *almost* five. The distinction between four and five apparently represented a transformation of cosmic significance.

"When I'm five, I'll be big," the boy explained between bites that were more gesture than consumption. "Bigger than now. Maybe taller. Do you get taller on your birthday?"

"Not usually overnight," Sheldon said. "Growth happens gradually."

"But I'll be *officially* big. That's different from just growing."

"That's true. Official bigness is its own category."

Tenchi nodded, satisfied that someone understood. "Father is bringing the cake. He said it would be big too. With five candles."

"Five candles for five years."

"And I get to blow them all out at once. Grandfather says if you blow them all out, your wish comes true. But you can't tell anyone the wish or it won't work."

"That's the traditional rule," Katsuhito confirmed from across the table. "Birthday wishes require discretion."

"I already know what I'm going to wish for." Tenchi's face went serious with the weight of the secret. "But I can't tell you."

"We wouldn't dream of asking."


After breakfast, Sheldon considered the problem of gifts.

He had money—more than enough to purchase something from the village shops. But money felt impersonal, and the shops themselves were limited in what they might offer a four-year-old about to become five. Toys, perhaps. Books. Practical things that any adult might choose for any child.

*What does Tenchi actually want?* he wondered. *What would mean something to him specifically?*

The answer came as he stood in his garden, surveying the cleared beds and the work yet to be done. Tenchi wanted to help with this. Tenchi wanted to be part of building something that would grow and change and produce visible results. Tenchi wanted—

*His own section.*

The idea crystallized with satisfying clarity. Not just helping with Sheldon's garden, but having a piece of it that was entirely his. A child-sized plot where he could plant whatever he chose, tend it himself, watch things grow under his own care.

*A garden of his own. That's a gift that keeps giving.*


The trip to the village took most of the morning.

Sheldon walked down the mountain path with a mental list: seeds appropriate for a child's first garden, small tools sized for small hands, perhaps a marker or sign to designate the plot as Tenchi's own. The village shops might not have everything, but they would have enough.

The agricultural supply store—the same one where he'd been directed weeks ago when asking about the Tsukino house—proved surprisingly well-stocked. The elderly proprietor remembered him, greeting him with the measured warmth of rural shopkeepers who observed everything and commented on little.

"Seeds for a child's garden?" The old man considered. "Radishes grow fast—good for impatient young hands. Sunflowers are dramatic. Cherry tomatoes are forgiving."

"All of those," Sheldon decided. "And whatever else you'd recommend."

The proprietor assembled a collection with the care of a curator: packets of seeds, a small trowel and fork sized for a child, a watering can that wouldn't be too heavy when full, and a hand-painted wooden stake that could serve as a garden marker.

"For the Masaki boy?" the old man asked while wrapping the purchases.

"For his birthday tomorrow."

"Ah." Something shifted in the proprietor's expression—not quite a smile, but something warmer than neutrality. "His mother used to shop here. Before." The word carried weight. "She had good instincts for growing things. The boy will too, I expect. It runs in families."

Sheldon absorbed this new piece of information—another thread connecting him to the woman whose absence shaped everything. "Thank you. For the seeds and the... insight."

"Growing things is good for children. Teaches patience. Responsibility. The satisfaction of results that take time." The old man handed over the wrapped bundle. "Tell him the sunflowers are from me. A birthday gift from an old man who remembers his mother."


The afternoon was spent in preparation of a different kind.

Back at his house, Sheldon marked out a section of garden bed near the corner where morning sun would be strongest. Child-sized—perhaps two meters by one—but positioned prominently where Tenchi would see it immediately upon arriving. He turned the soil one final time, removing any remaining stones or roots that might frustrate small hands.

The gift assembled itself: seeds arranged in their packets, tools laid out with care, the wooden stake waiting to be inscribed with Tenchi's name. Sheldon considered adding his own carving—something to match Katsuhito's skill with the Hikaru statue—but dismissed the idea. His talents, whatever they were, apparently did not extend to woodworking.

Instead, he wrote on the stake in careful characters: *Tenchi's Garden*. The calligraphy wasn't elegant, but it was legible. It would serve.

Hikaru supervised from the engawa, offering the occasional meow of what Sheldon chose to interpret as approval.

"You could help, you know."

The cat's expression suggested that helping was beneath his dignity, but watching was a vital contribution.


Evening brought the final element of preparation: food.

Tomorrow's celebration would center on Nobuyuki's cake, but Sheldon wanted to contribute something as well. A birthday breakfast that exceeded the ordinary. Something memorable.

He spent the hours before dinner planning: sweet rolled omelet, special rice with red beans, grilled fish arranged in festive shapes, fruits cut into flowers. Nothing beyond his capabilities, but everything elevated by intention and care.

*Kiyone's philosophy again,* he thought as he made notes. *Food made with intention. A birthday meal made with love.*

The word startled him. *Love.* Was that what this was? This warmth he felt for the boy who had attached himself so completely, so trustingly? This desire to see him happy, to contribute to his joy, to be part of his life?

*Yes,* he decided. *Whatever else I am or was or might become—yes. This is love. This is what it feels like from the inside.*


Dinner at the shrine that evening was quieter than breakfast had been.

Tenchi's morning excitement had modulated into something deeper—anticipation giving way to the solemn awareness that something significant was about to happen. He ate with unusual focus, occasionally glancing toward the door as if expecting tomorrow to arrive early through sheer force of will.

"One more sleep," he said finally, pushing away his empty bowl. "Just one more sleep and then I'll be five."

"Just one more sleep," Sheldon confirmed.

"Will you come early? For breakfast? You have to be there when I wake up."

"I'll be there."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi nodded, satisfied. Then, with the sudden physicality of children, he lunged across the table to wrap his arms around Sheldon's neck.

"Thank you for being here," he said into Sheldon's shoulder. "For my birthday. For everything."

Sheldon held him carefully, feeling the small body's warmth, the absolute trust in the embrace.

"Thank you for letting me be here," he said quietly. "It's the best gift I could have received."


Later, walking back to his house under the stars, Sheldon carried the warmth of that moment with him.

*Twenty-one days,* he thought. *Three weeks since I woke up in that field. And somehow I've ended up here—with a house, a garden, a cat, and a family that isn't mine by blood but is mine by choice.*

The stars overhead were the same stars that had witnessed his first confused night in this world. But everything else had changed. He had changed. Was still changing, day by day, meal by meal, conversation by conversation.

*Tomorrow Tenchi turns five. And I get to be there. I get to be part of it.*

The thought filled him with something he could only call gratitude—deep and simple and entirely unexpected.

Hikaru was waiting on the engawa when he arrived home, tail swishing in greeting. The cat had learned the rhythms of this new life as quickly as Sheldon had, adapting with feline pragmatism to the reality of regular meals and reliable shelter.

"Big day tomorrow," Sheldon told him. "Birthday. Celebrations. Probably fish."

Hikaru's ears perked at the last word.

"I thought that might interest you."

They went inside together—man and cat, resident and guardian, two creatures who had found each other in an unexpected place and decided to stay.

Tomorrow would bring celebration. Tonight brought peace.

It was enough. It was more than enough.

#### Scene 22.A: Tenchi Birthday

The twenty-second morning began before dawn.

Sheldon woke in darkness, guided by intention rather than alarm. He had breakfast to prepare—not ordinary breakfast, but a birthday breakfast for a boy who was about to become officially big. The meal needed to be ready before Tenchi woke, waiting for him like a gift unwrapped by morning light.

Hikaru observed from his usual spot as Sheldon gathered the ingredients he'd prepared the night before. The cat's expression suggested mild curiosity about these pre-dawn activities, but no inclination to participate.

"Birthday," Sheldon explained quietly. "Special occasion."

Hikaru's tail swished once—acknowledgment, or perhaps dismissal of human sentimentality.


The walk to the shrine in the gray pre-dawn carried the quality of a pilgrimage.

Sheldon moved quietly, the canvas bag over his shoulder holding the wrapped gift—seeds, tools, the marker with Tenchi's name. The larger gift, the garden plot itself, waited at his house for later. But this smaller package would be opened at breakfast, a promise of what was to come.

The shrine emerged from the darkness as the first hints of light touched the eastern sky. Katsuhito was already awake—a lamp glowing in the kitchen window, the soft sounds of morning preparation filtering through the screens.

"You're early," the old priest said as Sheldon entered through the kitchen door.

"I have a breakfast to make. For a certain five-year-old."

"Ah." Katsuhito's eyes warmed. "He's been officially five for approximately—" he glanced at the clock, "—four hours now. Born just after midnight."

"Has he woken yet?"

"Three times. Each time to confirm that he was, in fact, still having a birthday. I finally convinced him that birthdays are more enjoyable when celebrated well-rested." Katsuhito stepped aside, making room at the counter. "The kitchen is yours."


The birthday breakfast came together with the focused intensity that cooking always brought.

Sweet rolled omelet, golden and slightly sweet, cut into careful segments. Red bean rice—sekihan—the traditional celebratory dish, its color promising good fortune. Grilled fish arranged in the shape of a leaping carp, symbol of strength and perseverance. Fruits transformed into flowers through careful knife work: strawberry roses, apple blossoms, orange chrysanthemums.

Sheldon worked in silence, hands moving with the assurance that had become familiar over these three weeks. Each dish was intention made visible, love translated into flavor and form.

By the time Tenchi emerged from his room—unable to contain himself any longer—the table was set and waiting.

"*Whoa.*"

The boy stopped in the doorway, eyes wide. He was still in his sleeping clothes, hair standing in multiple directions, but his face held the pure wonder of a child encountering the extraordinary.

"Happy birthday, Tenchi." Sheldon stepped back from the table, allowing the full effect to register. "You're five now."

"I'm *five*." The word emerged as a whisper, heavy with significance. Then, louder: "I'm five! Grandfather! I'm five!"

"So I've been informed," Katsuhito said dryly, appearing behind his grandson. "Several times. Throughout the night."

But his eyes were soft as he watched Tenchi approach the table, taking in each element of the breakfast with reverent attention.

"The fish is a carp," the boy observed. "Carps are strong. They swim up waterfalls."

"They do. I thought it was appropriate for someone entering their fifth year."

"And the flowers are made of fruit. Real fruit. How did you make flowers out of fruit?"

"Practice. And sharp knives."

Tenchi's gaze moved to the red-tinged rice. "Sekihan. That's for celebrations. Grandmother used to make it for special days."

The mention of Kiyone—his mother, not his grandmother, but child-language sometimes compressed generations—carried unexpected weight. Katsuhito's expression flickered, then steadied.

"Your mother did make excellent sekihan," the old priest said quietly. "She would be pleased to see it on your birthday table."

Tenchi nodded, solemn for a moment. Then the solemnity cracked, replaced by the irrepressible energy of a five-year-old facing a feast.

"Can we eat now? Please? I'm officially five and officially hungry."


The meal was consumed with enthusiasm and appropriate ceremony.

Tenchi narrated each bite, providing running commentary on flavors and textures and the specific qualities that made birthday food superior to ordinary food. Katsuhito ate with quiet appreciation, occasionally meeting Sheldon's eyes with looks that communicated more than words could carry.

"This is the best birthday," Tenchi announced between mouthfuls. "Better than four. Four was good, but five is *better*."

"What made four good?" Sheldon asked.

"Grandfather made special breakfast. And Father came. And I got a toy car that I still have." Tenchi paused, considering. "But five has fruit flowers. And carp fish. And *you*."

The last word landed with weight that the boy didn't seem to notice. *And you.* Present. Included. Part of the celebration in a way that apparently elevated it above previous years.

"I'm glad to be here," Sheldon said, meaning it more than the simple words could convey.


The gift-giving came after the meal.

Sheldon retrieved the wrapped package from where he'd left it, presenting it to Tenchi with the formality the moment seemed to require.

"This is part of your gift," he explained. "The rest is waiting at my house. But this part you can open now."

Tenchi's hands trembled slightly as he worked at the wrapping—not impatience, but the awareness of significance. When the contents were revealed, his eyes went wide.

"Seeds," he breathed. "And tools. And—" He held up the wooden stake with its careful calligraphy. "It says my name. *Tenchi's Garden.*"

"You'll have your own section. A plot that's entirely yours to plant and tend. These seeds are what you'll put in the ground."

"My own garden?" The concept seemed to require processing. "Like... my own garden that belongs to me?"

"Exactly like that."

Tenchi looked at the seeds, at the child-sized tools, at the stake with his name. Then he looked at Sheldon with an expression that made the early rising and careful preparation worth every moment.

"This is the best present," he said. "Not just for five. For *ever*."

"The sunflowers are a special addition," Sheldon added. "From the man at the seed shop in the village. He remembered your mother, and wanted to send them for your birthday."

The information settled slowly. "The shop man knew my mother?"

"She used to buy seeds from him. He said she was good at growing things."

Tenchi looked at the sunflower packet with new reverence. "Then I'll grow the best sunflowers. For her."


Kindergarten could not be avoided, despite Tenchi's pointed suggestions that birthdays should probably be holidays.

"You can tell your friends it's your birthday," Katsuhito offered as consolation. "And this afternoon, we'll go to Sheldon's house and you can see your garden."

"And plant seeds?"

"If there's time before dinner. But we want to do it properly, not rush."

"Properly is good." Tenchi clutched his gift package, clearly planning to show it to everyone at school. "Can I bring these?"

"The tools should stay here. But the seed packets might travel well in your bag."

The compromise was acceptable. Tenchi prepared for school with uncharacteristic speed, eager to begin the day so that the afternoon could arrive sooner.

"I'll be here when you get back," Sheldon promised at the door. "We'll walk down to the house together."

"And plant?"

"And plant."

Tenchi's smile could have illuminated the mountain.


The day passed in preparation and anticipation.

Sheldon returned to his house to ensure the garden plot was perfect—one final turning of the soil, one last check for stones or debris that might frustrate small hands. Hikaru supervised from his preferred spot, offering occasional commentary in the form of meows that might have been encouragement or criticism.

"He's going to love it," Sheldon told the cat. "I hope."

Hikaru's expression suggested that the quality of the garden was less important than the continued provision of fish, but Sheldon chose to interpret this as agreement.

By early afternoon, when Tenchi would be returning from school, everything was ready. The plot waited in its corner of sun, turned earth dark and promising. The marker stood at one end, *Tenchi's Garden* facing outward like a declaration.

The sound of running feet announced the boy's arrival before he appeared—that familiar rapid patter on the path from the shrine, barely slowed by the descent.

"Where is it? Where's my garden?"

Tenchi burst through the garden gate with Katsuhito following at a more measured pace. His eyes found the prepared plot immediately, drawn by the stake with its calligraphy.

"There." Sheldon pointed, unnecessarily.

The boy approached his garden with the reverence of a pilgrim approaching a shrine. He knelt at the edge, touching the turned earth with careful fingers.

"It's real," he whispered. "My garden. My actual garden."

"Ready for planting. When you are."

Tenchi looked up, face bright with determination. "I'm ready. I've been ready all day. I told everyone at school about my garden and they were jealous but in a nice way and sensei said it was a wonderful present and I couldn't wait to come home and now I'm home and it's *real*."

The words tumbled out in a single breathless stream. Sheldon found himself smiling.

"Then let's plant."


The planting became ceremony.

Sheldon showed Tenchi how to create small furrows in the soil, spacing them properly for each type of seed. The boy absorbed the instruction with intense focus, asking questions about depth and distance and which seeds needed more sun.

"Radishes first," Sheldon suggested. "They grow fast. You'll see results in a few weeks."

"A few weeks is fast?"

"For gardens, yes. Some things take months. Some take years."

"That's a long time."

"It is. But the waiting is part of it. Watching something grow, day by day. Seeing the changes."

Tenchi considered this as he carefully placed radish seeds in their furrow. "Like growing up?"

"Exactly like that."

The sunflowers came next—the gift seeds from the shop owner who remembered Kiyone. Tenchi handled these with particular care, creating a row at the back of the plot where they would grow tall without shading the smaller plants.

"For Mother," he said quietly as he covered the seeds with soil. "So she knows I'm growing things too."

Katsuhito, watching from the engawa, made a soft sound that might have been acknowledgment or emotion or both.

Cherry tomatoes, radishes, sunflowers. The packets from the shop had included a few others—green onions, herbs, lettuce. Each found its place in Tenchi's garden, planted by small hands under careful guidance.

When the last seed was covered, Tenchi stood back to survey his work.

"Now what?"

"Now we water. Gently—we don't want to wash the seeds away."

Sheldon demonstrated with the small watering can, creating a soft rain that darkened the soil without disturbing it. Then he handed the can to Tenchi.

"Your garden. Your water."

The boy completed the task with solemn attention, ensuring every inch received its share. When the can was empty, he set it down and looked at the plot with satisfaction.

"Now they grow?"

"Now they grow. But you have to keep watering them. Every day, or every other day, depending on the weather. And watch for weeds."

"I will. I promise." Tenchi's voice carried the weight of sacred oath. "This is my garden. I'll take care of it."


Dinner that evening was at the shrine, a continuation of the birthday celebration.

The sekihan had been saved for the evening meal, joined by other celebratory dishes Katsuhito had prepared. The atmosphere was warm with accomplishment and anticipation—seeds planted, a new year of life begun, promises made for the growing season ahead.

"Father will bring cake on Friday," Tenchi reported, mouth full of rice. "He said it would be a big cake with five candles. Five candles for five years."

"The official birthday celebration," Katsuhito confirmed. "When family can gather properly."

"But today is the real birthday," Tenchi said with certainty. "Today I turned five. Friday is just... extra birthday."

"Extra birthday is a useful concept," Sheldon agreed. "One can never have too much celebration."

"Exactly." Tenchi nodded with the satisfaction of being understood. "Today is birthday. Friday is extra birthday. And now I have a garden."

"The best gift," Katsuhito said, echoing his grandson's earlier words. "Something that grows with you."


The evening wound down in the familiar rhythm of bath, stories, and gradual surrender to sleep.

But tonight Tenchi requested something specific: a story about gardens.

Sheldon obliged, weaving a tale about a boy who planted a magic seed—one that grew not into a plant, but into a door. A door that opened to a garden where everything the boy had ever loved was waiting: lost toys, forgotten friends, memories of happy days.

"The garden remembers everything," Sheldon explained as Tenchi's eyes grew heavy. "Because gardens are patient. They hold on to things. They keep them safe until we're ready to find them again."

"Like my garden will remember me?"

"Exactly like that. Even when you're grown up and have gardens of your own, this first one will remember. It will always be yours."

"That's good." Tenchi's voice was fading, sleep claiming him despite his best efforts. "I want to be remembered. By gardens. And by people."

"You will be," Sheldon promised. "You absolutely will be."

The boy's breathing slowed, steadied, deepened into dreams. Katsuhito appeared silently to carry him to bed, nodding to Sheldon in the doorway.

"Thank you," the old priest said quietly. "For all of it. The breakfast, the garden, the story. The being here."

"Thank you for letting me be here to give it."


The walk home under the stars felt like closing a chapter.

*Twenty-two days,* Sheldon thought. *And now he's five. Growing, changing, becoming whoever he's going to be. And somehow I'm part of that.*

The thought filled him with something he was learning to recognize as purpose. Not the abstract, cosmic purpose he sometimes sensed lurking at the edges of his awareness, but something simpler and more immediate. Day-to-day purpose. The purpose of showing up, of being present, of planting seeds—literal and metaphorical—and watching them grow.

Hikaru waited on the engawa, tail swishing in greeting. The cat had no interest in birthdays or gardens or cosmic significance, but he was consistent in his welcome.

"Good day," Sheldon told him. "One of the best."

Together, they went inside. Tomorrow would bring new routines, new growth, new steps forward. But tonight had been a celebration—of five years lived, of gardens planted, of family found in unexpected places.

It was enough. It was more than enough.

#### Scene 23.A: Twenty Third Morning

Sheldon woke to the weight of Hikaru on his feet.

The cat had migrated during the night from his customary spot at the foot of the futon to directly atop Sheldon's ankles, a warm and surprisingly heavy presence for an animal that weighed perhaps four kilograms. The orange tabby's purr vibrated through the blanket like a small motor.

"You're not subtle," Sheldon murmured.

Hikaru's response was to knead his paws twice against the futon, claws catching slightly in the fabric, before settling deeper into his position. The message was clear: *I'm comfortable. You figure it out.*

Sheldon lay still for a moment, cataloging the room in the gray pre-dawn light. Five days now. Five days since he'd carried his bag through that door and set it down in the corner. Five days of waking in this room, on this futon, in this house that bore his name even though it had belonged to people he'd never met.

The Tsukino house. His house, now.

The thought still didn't quite fit, like a shirt cut for broader shoulders. But it fit better today than it had on Day 18, when he'd stood in the empty main room and wondered what he was supposed to do with all this space. It fit better than Day 19, when he'd spent most of the day clearing the overgrown garden plot and feeling like an imposter playing house. Better than Day 20, when Nobuyuki Masaki had appeared on the shrine path and Sheldon had felt himself being measured by eyes that held no warmth until the end.

Better, but not perfect. Maybe perfect wasn't the goal.

Hikaru stretched, yawned, and finally deigned to relocate to the patch of futon Sheldon's leg had warmed. The cat curled into a tight ball, tucked his nose under his tail, and was immediately asleep again.

"Some help you are," Sheldon said, but he was smiling as he pushed back the blanket and rose.

The morning routine had taken shape over the past week. He folded the futon with economical movements—muscle memory now, hands knowing where the folds went—and stored it in the oshiire. He washed his face in the bathroom, the cold water sharp enough to banish the last of sleep. He dressed in work clothes: worn trousers, a simple shirt, the boots that had walked him from Okayama Station to Masaki Shrine on that first impossible day.

Twenty-three days. Had it only been twenty-three days?

In the kitchen—his kitchen, strange thought—Sheldon filled Hikaru's water bowl and measured out a portion of the dry food he'd picked up at the general store in the village. The sound of kibble rattling into the ceramic dish brought padding footsteps from the other room. Hikaru appeared in the doorway, stretched elaborately, and approached the food bowl with the studied casualness of a cat pretending he hadn't just sprinted from the bedroom.

"Your dignity is showing," Sheldon observed.

Hikaru ignored him and began eating.

Sheldon didn't prepare his own breakfast here—that happened at the shrine, where Katsuhito and Tenchi would be waiting. Instead, he tidied what little needed tidying, checked that the windows were secure, and stepped out into the morning.

The air held that particular quality of late April: cool enough to need movement, warm enough to promise summer's approach. The cherry blossoms were nearly gone now, the last petals clinging to branches or scattered across the ground in fading pink drifts. In another week, maybe two, the trees would be fully green.

Sheldon took the path toward the shrine at an easy pace. He'd walked this route enough times now that his feet knew the way without conscious thought—the slight dip where roots crossed the path, the stone that always seemed to catch the morning light, the bend where the trees opened and the torii gate became visible ahead.

The shrine compound was quiet this early. Smoke rose from the residence's chimney—Katsuhito already had the fire going. And there, on the engawa facing east, a small figure sat with his knees drawn up to his chest, watching the path.

Tenchi spotted him immediately.

"Sheldon-san!" The boy launched himself off the engawa and came running, bare feet slapping against the wooden platform and then the packed earth of the yard. "You're here! Come see if the seeds sprouted!"

"Good morning to you too," Sheldon said, but he was already being tugged by the hand toward the Tsukino house—his house—and the small garden plot at its rear.

"I wanted to check when I woke up," Tenchi said, words tumbling over each other in his eagerness, "but Grandfather said I had to wait until you were here because it's your garden too even though it's mostly my garden because I planted all the seeds and named all the rows—"

"You named the rows?"

"The radish row is Usagi and the carrot row is Kuma and the sunflower row is—" Tenchi stopped at the edge of the garden plot, his grip on Sheldon's hand tightening. His whole body went still.

Sheldon looked.

The garden was exactly as they'd left it yesterday afternoon: dark soil, carefully raked, with small markers indicating where each type of seed had been planted. The surface was undisturbed. No green shoots pushing through. No signs of life at all.

Just dirt.

"Oh," Tenchi said.

The disappointment in that single syllable was profound. Five years old, and already learning that wanting something didn't make it appear.

Sheldon crouched down beside him, bringing their eyes level. "What did we put in the ground yesterday?"

"Seeds," Tenchi said, his voice small.

"And what are seeds?"

Tenchi's brow furrowed. "They... grow into plants?"

"Eventually, yes. But first, they need to wake up." Sheldon touched the soil gently—cool and slightly damp from overnight dew. "Right now, the seeds are sleeping in there. They're feeling the water we gave them, feeling the warmth of the soil, starting to stretch inside their shells. It's like how you need time to wake up in the morning."

"I wake up fast," Tenchi said, though some of the devastation had left his voice.

"You do. Seeds are slower. The radishes—Usagi—will probably show their heads in about a week. Maybe a little less if the weather stays warm."

"A whole week?" The concept seemed to stagger Tenchi. A week was forever when you were five.

"Gardening teaches patience," Sheldon said. "Every day, we water. Every day, we look. And one morning—maybe when we're not even paying attention—we'll see a tiny green leaf poking through the soil."

Tenchi stared at the garden as if he could will the seeds to sprout through sheer intensity. Then his shoulders dropped slightly, accepting. "Can we still water today?"

"We should water today. The seeds need us to keep our promise."

That seemed to help. Tenchi retrieved the watering can from where they'd left it by the house's corner—already filled from yesterday's evening routine, topped off by dew—and began the careful process of giving each row a gentle soaking. He moved with the exaggerated care of someone entrusted with important work, tongue poking out slightly from the corner of his mouth.

Sheldon watched, and something in his chest ached sweetly.

"The sunflowers are for Mama," Tenchi said suddenly, not looking up from his task. "When they get big, they'll be tall enough to see from far away."

"They will," Sheldon agreed. His voice came out rougher than he'd intended.

"Grandfather says she can see us from everywhere now, but I think she'd like having something tall to look at. Something yellow, like her favorite color."

Sheldon had no response to that. None that would be adequate. Instead, he said, "I think she'd like that very much."

Tenchi finished watering, examined the garden one more time for any sign of change—there was none—and finally nodded with the gravity of a farmer surveying his fields. "Okay. Tomorrow we'll check again."

"Tomorrow," Sheldon agreed.

They walked back to the shrine together, Tenchi's earlier urgency replaced by a more contemplative mood. Katsuhito met them at the residence entrance, a knowing glint in his eyes.

"No sprouts yet, I take it."

"Sheldon-san says they need to wake up first," Tenchi reported. "Like sleeping, but for a whole week."

"Ah. Seeds are indeed slower than certain young boys I know." Katsuhito stepped aside to let them enter. "Breakfast is ready. Tenchi, you have school in an hour and a half, and you haven't dressed yet."

"But—"

"Miso soup grows cold faster than seeds grow tall. Go."

Tenchi went, padding toward his room with only one backward glance at Sheldon—a look that said *we'll check again tomorrow* as clearly as if he'd spoken it.

"His mother's garden was vegetables too," Katsuhito said quietly once Tenchi was out of earshot. "Tomatoes, eggplant, cucumbers. Kiyone always said flowers were pretty but food was useful. The sunflowers were Tenchi's addition."

Sheldon absorbed that. Another piece of a woman he'd never meet, preserved in the habits of those she'd left behind.

Breakfast was miso soup, rice, pickled vegetables, and grilled fish—the standard morning meal that Sheldon had learned to prepare under Katsuhito's patient guidance. They ate together, the three of them, while spring sunlight crept across the tatami and Tenchi chattered about what he might do at school today.

At eight-thirty, Tenchi was dressed in his kindergarten uniform, backpack strapped on, standing at the entrance of the residence with his outdoor shoes in hand.

"Extra birthday in three days," he said to Sheldon. "Three days is like... this many." He held up three fingers.

"I can count, Tenchi."

"But do you *remember*?"

"Your father is bringing a cake on Friday. I remember."

Tenchi nodded seriously, satisfied that the information had been properly recorded. Then he was off, running down the shrine steps—three hundred twenty of them, Sheldon had counted—with the boundless energy of a child who had never learned to walk when running was an option.

Sheldon watched until the small figure disappeared around the first bend, then turned to find Katsuhito beside him.

"You handled the garden disappointment well," the old priest said.

"It wasn't disappointing, not really. Just... educating." Sheldon paused. "He didn't expect them to sprout overnight. He hoped."

"There's a difference?"

"Hope survives disappointment. Expectation breeds resentment."

Katsuhito made a thoughtful sound. "That's an old soul's observation."

Sheldon didn't know how to respond to that, so he said nothing.

The morning spread out before them, empty of obligations for the moment. Tenchi wouldn't return until mid-afternoon. The shrine needed its daily maintenance, but that was Katsuhito's rhythm, not his. The house—his house—had no urgent projects waiting.

"I was thinking," Sheldon said, "of starting on the front garden today. The Tsukino house's front garden," he clarified. "It's overgrown, but there's structure underneath. Someone planted it deliberately, years ago."

"Setsuko Tsukino," Katsuhito said. "Himari's mother. She loved azaleas."

Another name, another piece of history preserved in soil and stems. This village was layered with the memories of people Sheldon had never known, each generation planting something the next would tend.

"I'll see what can be salvaged," Sheldon said.

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "There may be tools in the shrine's storage shed. Old, but serviceable. I'll show you after I've made my morning rounds."

"Thank you."

They stood together for a moment longer, watching the empty path where Tenchi had vanished, listening to the birds beginning their morning chorus in the trees around the shrine.

Twenty-three days. Twenty-three days of learning this place, these people, these rhythms.

Sheldon had no idea how many more days stretched ahead. Thousands, probably. Tens of thousands. A lifetime, if he was lucky.

He'd better get started.

---

#### Scene 23.B: Twenty Third Afternoon

The shrine's storage shed stood at the edge of the compound, half-hidden behind a stand of bamboo that had clearly been planted to screen it from the main buildings. It was old—older than the residence, Sheldon suspected, built from timber that had weathered to a silver-gray that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it.

Katsuhito produced a key from somewhere in his robes and worked it into a lock that looked like it predated the Meiji Restoration.

"This shed has been here longer than I have," the old priest said, which was either a joke or a confession, depending on how one interpreted his earlier comment about seven hundred years. "The tools inside are... eclectic."

The door swung open with a creak that suggested the hinges hadn't seen oil in decades. Sheldon peered inside.

Eclectic was generous.

The shed was perhaps three meters deep and four wide, and every centimeter of wall space had been pressed into service. Tools hung from pegs driven into the timber: saws of various sizes, their teeth dark with age; hammers with handles worn smooth by generations of hands; chisels, planes, files, rasps. A workbench ran along one wall, its surface scarred and stained but solid. Shelves held boxes and jars whose labels had faded to illegibility.

And in the back, propped against the wall like soldiers awaiting orders, stood an array of garden implements.

"The Tsukino family stored their tools here after Himari passed," Katsuhito said. "Her father was the last to use most of these. That was... twenty years ago, perhaps more."

Sheldon stepped inside carefully, mindful of the packed earth floor and the dust that hung in the air like suspended time. His eyes adjusted to the dimness, and details emerged: a hand scythe with a curved blade that still held an edge; a set of pruning shears in a leather case; a hori-hori—a Japanese garden knife—with a blade that showed the marks of frequent sharpening; several trowels of different sizes; a rake with bamboo tines.

He reached for the hori-hori first. The handle was wood, darkened by decades of contact with hands and soil. The blade was steel, slightly rusted near the base but sound. He tested the edge against his thumb—still sharp enough to matter.

"This belonged to Setsuko," Katsuhito said, watching him. "Himari's mother. She was particular about her tools. Cleaned and oiled them after every use."

"She took care of them," Sheldon said. The hori-hori felt right in his hand, balanced and purposeful. "They took care of her garden."

"A philosophy."

"A relationship."

Katsuhito made that thoughtful sound again—the one that seemed to contain entire conversations he chose not to voice.

Sheldon selected a few more tools: the pruning shears, a small hand rake, the trowels. He found a canvas bag hanging from a peg—also old, also well-made—and loaded his selections into it. The weight settled against his hip as he slung the strap over his shoulder.

"I'll bring them back when I'm done," he said.

"Keep them at the house." Katsuhito's voice was mild. "Setsuko's tools should return to Setsuko's garden. They've waited long enough."

He had no words for that. He simply nodded and stepped back out into the spring sunlight.


The front garden of the Tsukino house had been invisible to him for the first two weeks—not literally, but functionally. He'd walked past it every day on his way to and from the shrine, registered it as "overgrown vegetation," and moved on. There had been more pressing concerns: the roof, the interior cleaning, the rear garden plot for Tenchi's seeds.

Now, standing at the edge of the property with Setsuko's tools on his hip, he actually looked.

The garden occupied the space between the house's front wall and the low fence that marked the boundary with the path. Perhaps six meters wide and three deep, it was a tangle of growth that had clearly once been something else. Weeds had claimed the open spaces. Vines had climbed what might have been trellises. Grass had invaded from the edges, creeping inward year after year.

But underneath—yes, there was structure. He could see it now that he was looking. The bones of paths, buried under leaf litter. The shapes of beds, their edges softened but still present. And rising above the chaos, the woody stems of something that had survived despite years of neglect.

Azaleas. They had to be.

Sheldon set down the tool bag, rolled up his sleeves, and began.


The work was meditative in its simplicity.

He started at one corner, clearing a small section completely before moving to the next. The hand rake pulled away the accumulated debris—dead leaves, fallen twigs, the detritus of seasons piled upon seasons. Beneath it, he found soil: dark, rich, alive with the movement of insects that fled the sudden light.

The weeds came next. He used the hori-hori for the deep-rooted ones, sliding the blade into the soil beside them and levering them out with their root systems intact. The shallow-rooted invaders he simply pulled by hand, tossing them into a growing pile at the garden's edge.

His hands knew this work.

That was the strange thing—the thing he'd noticed before but still couldn't explain. His body remembered movements his mind had never learned. The angle of the blade for maximum leverage. The way to grip a weed's base to extract the entire root. The rhythm of clear, examine, move that turned chaos into order one handspan at a time.

He'd never gardened seriously in his previous life. A few houseplants, maybe. A failed attempt at tomatoes on an apartment balcony. Nothing like this deliberate, patient restoration of someone else's abandoned creation.

Yet his hands moved with confidence, and the garden responded.

By mid-morning, he'd cleared perhaps a quarter of the space. The bones of Setsuko's design were emerging: a curved path of flat stones, nearly invisible under the debris; a raised bed edged with larger rocks, arranged with obvious intention; and the azaleas—three of them, their woody stems twisted and overgrown but unmistakably alive.

Sheldon sat back on his heels and studied them.

They'd grown wild without pruning, sending out branches in all directions, competing with each other and with the weeds for light and space. But the root systems were established, decades old, drawing from soil that Setsuko had prepared and planted them in. They'd survived her absence. They'd survived Himari's absence. They'd survived twenty years of neglect.

They were still here.

"You're tougher than you look," Sheldon said to the nearest azalea. Its response was a slight movement of leaves in the breeze, which he chose to interpret as agreement.

He reached for the pruning shears.


Pruning was different from clearing. Clearing was removal—taking away what didn't belong. Pruning was sculpture—deciding what to keep and what to sacrifice, shaping the plant toward some future version of itself.

Sheldon had never pruned azaleas before. He was certain of that. The theoretical physicist from his memories had possessed no knowledge of ornamental shrub maintenance whatsoever.

But his hands knew where to cut.

He started with the dead wood—branches that had died and dried, serving no purpose except to crowd the living growth. The shears snipped through them cleanly, and he tossed the debris onto the pile. Then the crossing branches, the ones that rubbed against each other and would eventually damage the bark. Then the interior growth that blocked airflow and light.

With each cut, the azalea's shape emerged more clearly. It had been planted to be rounded—a soft dome of foliage that would have been covered in flowers every spring. Twenty years of neglect had turned it into a wild tangle, but the underlying form was still there, waiting to be revealed.

He worked slowly, stepping back frequently to assess, making adjustments, following an aesthetic logic he couldn't have articulated but somehow understood.

By the time his stomach informed him it was past noon, the first azalea looked like a plant again rather than a thicket. The second and third still needed attention, but the clearing around them was complete. The stone path was fully visible now, its curves leading the eye from the entrance to the house's front step. The raised bed awaited replanting—he'd need to think about what might go there.

Sheldon set down the shears, stretched his back, and surveyed his work.

Not bad for a morning. Not bad at all.


Lunch was a simple affair: rice from the shrine's morning pot, reheated in a small pan over the kitchen fire; pickled vegetables from the jar Katsuhito had given him as a housewarming gift; a single egg, scrambled with green onions he'd found growing wild at the garden's edge.

The egg was perfect.

He hadn't tried for perfect—hadn't consciously aimed for the exact moment when the curds were set but still glossy, when the onions had softened just enough to sweeten but not enough to lose their bite. He'd simply cooked, and the result had been exactly what the ingredients wanted to become.

Supreme Chef. That was what he'd started calling it in his head, though the name felt grandiose for what amounted to an inability to make bad food. Every meal he prepared came out precisely as it should. Every cut, every temperature, every timing—all of it aligned without conscious effort.

It was useful. It was also deeply, persistently strange.

Sheldon ate his perfect scrambled eggs at the low table in the main room, Hikaru watching from a patch of sunlight near the window. The cat had emerged from wherever he'd spent the morning—probably the bedroom, probably asleep—and was now performing his supervisory duties with appropriate gravitas.

"Don't give me that look," Sheldon said. "You've already been fed."

Hikaru's expression suggested that previous feedings were historical events with no bearing on present circumstances.

"No."

The cat yawned, clearly unimpressed by this show of resolve, and began grooming his paw.

Sheldon finished his meal, washed the dishes, and returned to the garden.


The afternoon passed in the same rhythm as the morning: clear, examine, prune, move. The second azalea took shape under his hands, then the third. He found other survivors buried in the overgrowth—a small camellia he hadn't noticed, its glossy leaves nearly hidden by vines; what might have been a dwarf maple, badly in need of attention but alive; a ground cover plant he couldn't identify, spreading beneath the chaos with quiet determination.

Setsuko had planted a garden meant to last. She'd chosen plants that could endure, rooted them deep, given them the foundation to survive whatever came. And they had. Through neglect, through abandonment, through years of accumulated debris, they had held on.

Sheldon thought about that as he worked. About things that endured. About foundations laid by people who couldn't know what would come after them. About the strange responsibility of inheriting someone else's creation and deciding what to do with it.

He was still thinking about it when he heard footsteps on the path and looked up to see Tenchi running toward him.

"Sheldon-san! Sheldon-san, I'm back from school!"

The boy skidded to a stop at the garden's edge, eyes wide as he took in the transformation. The tangle of that morning was gone, replaced by something that actually looked like a garden—rough, still recovering, but recognizable.

"You found plants," Tenchi said, wonder in his voice. "There were plants under there the whole time?"

"Azaleas," Sheldon said, pointing. "And a camellia, and maybe a maple. They were planted a long time ago by a woman named Setsuko. She was your great-great-grandmother's mother."

Tenchi's brow furrowed as he tried to work out that genealogical chain. "That's... a lot of greats."

"It is. She planted this garden many years before you were born. And the plants she chose were strong enough to survive until someone came to take care of them again."

Tenchi considered this with the gravity it apparently deserved. Then: "Like the seeds in my garden?"

"Yes. Like seeds. They wait for what they need, and when they get it, they grow."

Tenchi nodded slowly. Then his eyes lit up. "Can I help?"

Sheldon looked at the remaining work—one more section to clear, debris to dispose of, tools to clean. All of it manageable alone, but none of it requiring solitude.

"Get the hand rake from the bag," he said. "I'll show you how to clear without damaging the roots."

Tenchi practically dove for the tool bag, emerging with the bamboo rake held like a trophy. Sheldon positioned him at a cleared section, demonstrated the gentle scraping motion that removed debris without disturbing the soil beneath, and watched as the boy began to work with the same focused intensity he'd brought to watering his own garden that morning.

They worked together as the afternoon light softened toward evening, the old garden slowly remembering what it had been, the new gardener learning what it could become.

---

#### Scene 23.C: Twenty Third Evening

The light had turned golden by the time they stopped.

Tenchi sat back on his heels, the bamboo rake still clutched in both hands, surveying the cleared section with the satisfaction of someone who had done real work. His face was streaked with dirt where he'd wiped sweat away, and bits of leaf debris clung to his hair.

"We did a lot," he said.

"We did." Sheldon stretched, feeling the pleasant ache in his shoulders and lower back—the kind of tiredness that came from honest labor rather than strain. "The garden looks better than it has in twenty years."

"Is that a long time?"

"Longer than you've been alive. Four times longer."

Tenchi's eyes went wide as he tried to process that math. "That's... really long."

"It is." Sheldon stood, brushing soil from his knees. "Time to clean up. The tools need care before we put them away."

He showed Tenchi how to knock the loose dirt from the rake's tines, how to wipe down the metal parts with an oiled rag to prevent rust, how to hang each tool in its proper place. The boy watched with serious attention, mimicking each movement with the deliberate care of someone learning something important.

"Setsuko-san did this too?" Tenchi asked.

"Every time she used these tools. That's why they still work after all these years."

Tenchi nodded slowly, absorbing this. Then: "Will my garden tools last that long?"

"If you take care of them the same way."

The tool bag went into the small storage space beneath the engawa—not the shrine's shed anymore, but here, where Setsuko had kept them. Where they belonged.

"We should tell Grandfather about the azaleas," Tenchi said as they walked toward the shrine path. His energy had shifted from the focused intensity of work to the bubbling excitement of news to share. "And the camellia. And the maybe-maple."

"Maybe-maple?"

"You said 'might be a maple.' So it's a maybe-maple until we know for sure."

Sheldon couldn't argue with that logic.


Katsuhito was on the engawa when they arrived, a cup of tea cooling beside him, watching the evening light filter through the trees. His eyes tracked their approach—noted the dirt, the tired satisfaction, the way Tenchi immediately launched into a breathless report of the afternoon's discoveries.

"—and there were three azaleas the whole time, just hiding, and Setsuko-san planted them before I was even born, before *anyone* was born practically, and Sheldon-san let me use the rake and I cleared a whole section by myself—"

"I see," Katsuhito said, his voice mild but his eyes amused. "And did the garden appreciate being found?"

Tenchi paused, considering this with unexpected seriousness. "I think so. The plants looked happier after we cleared all the stuff away. They could breathe."

"Plants do appreciate breathing room." Katsuhito's gaze shifted to Sheldon. "You've been productive."

"The front garden was waiting for someone to remember it." Sheldon settled onto the engawa, accepting the unspoken invitation. "Setsuko built something meant to last. It just needed tending."

"Most worthwhile things do."

Tenchi had already disappeared inside, presumably to wash up before dinner. The sound of running water and splashing carried through the open shoji.

"He worked well," Sheldon said. "Focused. Patient, mostly."

"He wanted to impress you."

The observation landed with quiet weight. Sheldon turned it over, examining it from different angles. "I hope I gave him reason to feel proud instead."

Katsuhito made that thoughtful sound—the one Sheldon was beginning to recognize as approval, or at least acknowledgment that something worth thinking about had been said.


Dinner was a collaborative effort.

Katsuhito had rice cooking and miso soup simmering, but the fish—three small mackerel from the village market—sat waiting on the cutting board. Sheldon was at the counter before conscious decision caught up, knife in hand, preparing the fish for grilling with movements that felt as natural as breathing.

Supreme Chef. He'd named the ability in his own head, but moments like this made the name feel inadequate. It wasn't just skill—it was *rightness*, a sense of exactly what the ingredients needed and how to give it to them. The knife found the perfect angle. The seasoning measured itself. The grill reached temperature at precisely the right moment.

Tenchi watched from the table, freshly scrubbed and wearing clean clothes, as Sheldon laid the fish over the coals.

"How do you know when they're done?"

"The skin tells you." Sheldon pointed to where the edges were beginning to crisp. "See how it's pulling back slightly? And the flesh is turning opaque from the bottom up. When the color change reaches about three-quarters of the way—"

"You flip it?"

"Exactly."

"Can I flip one?"

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito, who gave an almost imperceptible nod.

"Come here. Use this." He handed Tenchi a flat spatula, positioning the boy's hands correctly. "Slide it under—gently—and turn it toward you, not away. Ready?"

Tenchi's tongue poked out in concentration. The flip was slightly clumsy but successful, the fish landing skin-side up without breaking apart.

"I did it!"

"You did."

The meal that followed was simple—grilled mackerel, rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables—but the fish had achieved that precise balance of crispy skin and tender flesh that elevated simple into satisfying. Tenchi ate with the unselfconscious enthusiasm of a child who had worked hard and was now properly hungry.

"Extra birthday in two days," he announced between bites. "That's... this many." He held up two fingers.

"I remember," Sheldon said.

"Dad's bringing cake."

"You mentioned."

"Chocolate cake. With strawberries." Tenchi's expression suggested this was the most important information in the universe. "And candles. Five candles because I'm five, plus one extra for good luck."

"Six candles for five years. The math works out."

Katsuhito smiled into his soup.


After dinner, they walked to the rear garden together—Tenchi's garden, the one they'd planted together—for the evening watering ritual.

The soil was still dark from the morning's watering, but the late afternoon sun had dried the surface. Tenchi filled the watering can from the rain barrel, carried it carefully to the edge of the plot, and began the same methodical process he'd performed that morning.

Still no sprouts. The soil remained undisturbed, giving no sign of the seeds sleeping beneath.

"Tomorrow?" Tenchi asked, though his tone suggested he already knew the answer.

"Tomorrow we check again. And the day after, and the day after that."

"Until Usagi wakes up."

"Until Usagi wakes up."

Tenchi finished watering, set down the can, and stood for a moment looking at the garden with an expression too complex for his four years—hope and patience and a kind of tender protectiveness for things not yet visible.

"Goodnight, seeds," he said quietly. Then, seeming to remember he had an audience, he turned to Sheldon with slightly pink cheeks. "I say goodnight. So they know someone's watching."

"That's a good practice."

They walked back to the shrine together, the evening settling around them like a comfortable garment. Katsuhito was waiting on the engawa, ready for the bedtime routine that had become familiar over the past weeks.

"Goodnight, Sheldon-san," Tenchi said at the entrance, already half-asleep on his feet. "Thank you for the garden."

"Thank you for the help."

Tenchi smiled—a small, tired smile that held more warmth than seemed possible from such a compact source—and disappeared inside.


The walk back to the Tsukino house was quiet, the path familiar now even in the dimming light. Sheldon's feet found the roots and stones without conscious attention, his body navigating while his mind drifted.

Twenty-three days. The number kept returning, a kind of milestone marker. Twenty-three days since he'd woken in this body, in this place, with no explanation and no clear purpose. Twenty-three days of building something he couldn't name—routines, relationships, the slow accumulation of trust and familiarity.

The house emerged from the trees, darker than the shrine residence but somehow welcoming. A shadow moved in the window—Hikaru, keeping watch.

Sheldon let himself in, set his boots by the genkan, and padded across the tatami to where the cat waited.

"You've been supervising my absence?"

Hikaru's response was to wind between his ankles, a brief acknowledgment before resuming his post on the windowsill.

The evening routine unfolded: water for the cat, a brief check of the house, preparation of the futon. Sheldon's muscles announced their fatigue as he moved through each task—not pain, just the honest accounting of a body that had done good work.

He lay down on the futon, Hikaru settling at his feet, and stared at the ceiling in the gathering darkness.

The garden would be waiting tomorrow. Setsuko's azaleas, slowly remembering what they were meant to be. Tenchi's vegetables, still dreaming beneath the soil. The camellia, the maybe-maple, the ground cover plant whose name he still didn't know.

All of them waiting. All of them patient. All of them growing in ways that couldn't be seen but were happening nonetheless.

Sheldon closed his eyes.

Tomorrow was Day 24. Two more days until Tenchi's extra birthday. Four more days until the end of April. Beyond that—unknowable distances, countless tomorrows, a lifetime of days not yet lived.

But tonight, this day was complete.

He let sleep take him.

---

#### Scene 24.A: Twenty Fourth Morning

Rain.

Sheldon woke to the sound of it—a steady patter against the roof tiles, softer than he'd expected, almost musical. The room was darker than usual, the gray morning light filtered through clouds that must have rolled in overnight.

Hikaru had abandoned his post at the foot of the futon for the windowsill, where he sat watching the water streak down the glass with the focused intensity of a scientist observing an experiment.

"Fascinated or offended?" Sheldon asked.

The cat's ear twitched in acknowledgment, but his attention remained fixed on the rain.

The morning routine adjusted itself to the weather. Sheldon dressed in indoor clothes rather than work gear—no garden restoration today, not with the soil turning to mud. He fed Hikaru, checked the windows for leaks (none; the repairs from Day 16 were holding), and stood for a moment at the door, watching the rain transform the familiar landscape into something softer, edges blurred, colors deepened.

The path to the shrine would be slick. He pulled on his boots, took the umbrella he'd acquired from the village store, and stepped out into the wet morning.


The shrine compound wore the rain well.

Water dripped from the eaves of the haiden in silver curtains. The gravel paths had darkened to pewter. The trees seemed to lean into the moisture, leaves catching drops and releasing them in small cascades. Everything smelled of wet earth and green things growing.

Tenchi was not on the engawa this morning—too wet for his usual perch. Instead, Sheldon found him pressed against the shoji inside, nose nearly touching the paper, watching the rain through the translucent screen.

"It's raining," Tenchi announced, as if this might not be obvious.

"I noticed."

"We can't check the garden."

"We can check it. We just can't work in it."

Tenchi considered this distinction with visible skepticism. "But it's *raining*."

"Rain is good for gardens. The seeds are getting water without us having to carry it."

This seemed to mollify him slightly. "So Usagi is still waking up?"

"Usagi is getting a bath. Seeds like baths."

Katsuhito appeared from the kitchen, tea already prepared. "The garden will survive one day without inspection, Tenchi. As will you."

"But tomorrow is—"

"Tomorrow is tomorrow. Today is today." Katsuhito handed Sheldon a cup. "The rain should clear by afternoon, according to the radio. Light showers, nothing sustained."

Breakfast was quieter than usual, the rain providing a backdrop that seemed to encourage contemplation rather than chatter. Even Tenchi ate with less commentary, though his eyes kept drifting toward the windows.

"Tomorrow," he said finally, unable to contain it any longer, "is my extra birthday."

"It is," Sheldon agreed.

"Dad is coming."

"He is."

"With cake."

"Chocolate, with strawberries. Six candles."

Tenchi nodded, satisfied that the essential facts remained in order. Then, with the abrupt topic shifts characteristic of five-year-olds: "Will it rain tomorrow?"

"I don't know. Would rain ruin your birthday?"

Tenchi thought about this with unexpected seriousness. "No," he decided. "Because cake is inside. And candles work inside. And Dad will come even if it rains because he's Dad."

"Sound logic."

"But I want to show him the garden." Tenchi's voice dropped slightly. "Both gardens. The one with Usagi and the one with the azaleas."

"If it rains, we can still show him. Rain doesn't make gardens invisible."

"But they look better when it's sunny."

Sheldon set down his chopsticks. "They look different when it's sunny. Not necessarily better. Gardens in rain have their own kind of beauty—everything washed clean, colors deeper, the plants drinking. Your father might like seeing them that way."

Tenchi absorbed this, his expression shifting from worry to curiosity. "Different beautiful?"

"Different beautiful."

Katsuhito made that thoughtful sound—the one Sheldon had learned to recognize as silent approval. The conversation moved on to school, to what Tenchi might do in class today, to the small logistics of a rainy Wednesday morning.

At eight-thirty, Tenchi stood at the entrance in his rain boots and yellow slicker, hood pulled up, backpack protected under a waterproof cover Katsuhito had produced from somewhere.

"One more sleep," he said, holding up a single finger.

"One more sleep," Sheldon confirmed.

Tenchi grinned—bright and unguarded—and splashed down the shrine steps into the rain.


With Tenchi gone and the garden work suspended, the morning opened into unexpected space.

Sheldon helped Katsuhito with indoor shrine maintenance—polishing the offering vessels, sweeping the haiden's wooden floor, organizing the storage closet where ritual implements were kept. The work was meditative, requiring attention but not strain, leaving room for the mind to drift.

"You've settled well," Katsuhito observed during a pause in the work.

"I'm still figuring out what 'settled' means."

"Most people are." Katsuhito ran a cloth along a brass vessel, bringing out its dull shine. "The difference is whether you're fighting the uncertainty or building within it."

"Which am I doing?"

"That's not a question I can answer for you."

They worked in companionable silence. The rain continued its gentle percussion against the roof. Somewhere in the village below, a dog barked once and fell quiet.

"Tenchi talks about you constantly," Katsuhito said. "To me. To Nobuyuki on the phone. Yesterday he told his teacher about the maybe-maple."

Sheldon's hands stilled on the vessel he was polishing. "He's easy to talk to."

"He's easy to love. Whether you allow yourself to do so is a different matter."

The observation landed with precision—not accusation, just acknowledgment of something Sheldon had been carefully not examining. He resumed polishing, the rhythm of the motion providing space to think.

"I'm not sure what I'm allowed," he said finally. "Or what's fair to him."

"Fair to him would be honesty about your presence. Which you've given—you're here, you're participating, you're not pretending to be something you're not." Katsuhito set down the vessel and looked at Sheldon directly. "What you're uncertain about is permission. Whether you have the right to matter to him."

"Do I?"

"You don't get to decide that. He does. And he already has."

The rain filled the silence that followed—not uncomfortable, just present. Sheldon turned Katsuhito's words over, examining them from different angles.

"I'm not going anywhere," he said. "Not by choice."

"Then the question becomes irrelevant. You're here. He's chosen you. The rest is just fear dressed up as philosophy."

Katsuhito returned to his polishing, the conversation apparently complete. But something had shifted—some knot of uncertainty loosened, if not untied entirely.

Sheldon finished the vessel in his hands and reached for the next one. Outside, the rain began to lighten.

---

#### Scene 24.B: Twenty Fourth Evening

The rain stopped shortly after noon, leaving the world washed and gleaming.

By the time Tenchi came running up the shrine steps—boots splashing through the puddles rather than avoiding them—patches of blue had broken through the clouds. The afternoon light had that peculiar clarity that follows rain, making colors sharper and distances seem closer.

"Did you check the garden?" was his first question, breathless from the climb.

"I waited for you."

Tenchi's face split into a grin that suggested this was exactly the right answer.

They walked to the rear garden together, boots squelching in the wet grass. The soil was dark and saturated, small pools collecting in the lower spots. Tenchi crouched at the edge, peering at the surface with the intensity of someone expecting revelation.

Still nothing. Just earth, undisturbed, giving no sign of what stirred beneath.

"The rain helped," Sheldon said. "Even if we can't see it yet."

"Usagi is drinking." Tenchi nodded, accepting this. "Getting stronger."

"Exactly."

They checked the front garden next—a quick survey rather than work. The rain had been gentle enough not to damage the pruned azaleas, and the cleared paths were already draining. The maybe-maple's leaves held droplets that caught the late sunlight like small crystals.

"Tomorrow Dad can see everything," Tenchi said, satisfied. "Even if it's still wet."

"Different beautiful?"

"Different beautiful."


Dinner was Sheldon's turn to cook—a rotation that had developed naturally over the past weeks. He made curry rice, adjusting the spice level for Tenchi's palate, letting the familiar rhythms of kitchen work settle his thoughts.

Katsuhito's words from the morning lingered. *The rest is just fear dressed up as philosophy.* The observation was uncomfortably accurate. Sheldon had been holding something back—not affection, exactly, but the acknowledgment of it. As if naming the bond would somehow make it more vulnerable.

But Tenchi had already named it, in his own way. Every "Sheldon-san," every garden check, every breathless report of discoveries real and imagined. The boy wasn't waiting for permission.

The curry came out perfectly—Supreme Chef never missed—and Tenchi pronounced it "the best curry in the world," which was almost certainly hyperbole but felt earned nonetheless.

"Tomorrow," Tenchi said around a mouthful of rice, "no more sleeps. Just wake up and it's my birthday."

"That's how it works."

"And Dad will be here."

"In the afternoon, after work."

"And there will be cake."

"Chocolate with strawberries. Six candles."

Tenchi held up five fingers, counting them to make sure the number was right. It was.

After dinner, they performed the evening watering—unnecessary after the rain, but Tenchi insisted. "So the seeds know we didn't forget them." He walked the rows carefully, watering can held like a ritual object, giving each section a ceremonial sprinkle.

"Goodnight, Usagi. Goodnight, Kuma. Goodnight, sunflowers." He paused, looking at Sheldon. "Do you want to say goodnight?"

Sheldon crouched beside him. "Goodnight, seeds. Keep growing."

Tenchi nodded approvingly, satisfied that the ritual had been properly observed.


The walk back to the Tsukino house felt different tonight.

Not the path—the path was the same, familiar now in a way that felt permanent rather than temporary. But something in Sheldon had shifted, some resistance loosened. Katsuhito's words, maybe. Or Tenchi's unselfconscious invitation to say goodnight to seeds. Or just the accumulation of days, each one building on the last, creating something that looked increasingly like a life.

Hikaru met him at the door, tail high, performing his usual inspection of Sheldon's boots before allowing entry.

"I'm home," Sheldon said, and for the first time, the words didn't feel strange.

The evening routine: water for the cat, check the windows, prepare the futon. Outside, the clouds had fully cleared, revealing stars that seemed closer than they had in Tokyo—less light pollution here, more sky.

Tomorrow was Day 25. Tenchi's extra birthday. Nobuyuki would come with cake and questions. The gardens would be inspected and praised. Six candles would be lit and blown out.

And Sheldon would be there for all of it, not as a temporary presence but as whatever he was becoming—family, maybe, or something close enough that the word stopped mattering.

He lay down on the futon. Hikaru claimed his usual spot. The stars wheeled slowly overhead, invisible through the roof but present nonetheless.

Tomorrow would be a good day.

Sheldon let himself believe it.

---

#### Scene 25.A: Extra Birthday Morning

Sheldon woke to silence—no rain, no cat on his feet. Just the pale light of early morning and the distant sound of birds beginning their chorus.

He found Hikaru at the window again, but this time the cat was watching something outside rather than water on glass. Sheldon rose and looked: the sky had cleared completely overnight, leaving behind the kind of crystalline blue that only appeared after storms.

"Good birthday weather," he said.

Hikaru's tail twitched in what might have been agreement.

The walk to the shrine felt different today—charged with anticipation that wasn't entirely his own. When he reached the compound, he understood why: Tenchi was already outside, still in his pajamas, standing at the edge of the rear garden with a stuffed rabbit clutched under one arm.

"Sheldon-san!" Tenchi spotted him and came running, the rabbit bouncing against his side. "It's my birthday! Well, my extra birthday, but it still counts!"

"Happy birthday." Sheldon crouched to meet him at eye level. "You're up early."

"I couldn't sleep anymore. I tried, but my eyes kept opening." Tenchi held up the rabbit—worn, well-loved, one ear slightly lopsided from years of handling. "Usagi wanted to see the garden too. I told her I named a row after her."

Sheldon looked at the rabbit with appropriate gravity. "I'm sure she's honored."

"She is. She said so."

They walked to the garden together, Tenchi's bare feet leaving prints in the dew-wet grass. The soil was still damp from yesterday's rain, dark and rich, and Tenchi crouched at the edge with Usagi propped beside him, both of them peering at the undisturbed surface.

"Still sleeping," Tenchi said, but there was no disappointment in his voice this time. "That's okay. Usagi—the row Usagi, not bunny Usagi—is getting stronger. Maybe she'll wake up for my real birthday."

"When's your real birthday?"

"April 24th. But that was a Monday, and Dad couldn't come because of work." Tenchi picked up Usagi the bunny and brushed a bit of grass from her fur. "So we have an extra birthday when Dad can be here. Because birthdays are for family."

"You are," Sheldon agreed, and meant it.


Breakfast was festive by Katsuhito's understated standards—special rice with red beans, grilled fish, pickled plum. Tenchi ate with the vibrating energy of a child counting down hours rather than days.

"Dad will be here at four," he announced, as if this information might have changed overnight. "That's after school, after lunch, after... a lot of things."

"It is."

"But then there's cake. And candles. And I get to blow them out and make a wish." Tenchi's expression grew serious. "I already know what I'm going to wish for."

"Don't tell us," Katsuhito said mildly. "Wishes told don't come true."

"I know." Tenchi nodded solemnly. "I won't tell. But it's a good wish."

At eight-thirty, he was dressed in his kindergarten uniform, backpack on, Usagi tucked carefully inside where she could watch but wouldn't get dirty. He paused at the entrance, looking back at Sheldon.

"You'll be here when I get back? And when Dad comes?"

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi held up his pinky finger—the Japanese gesture for a binding oath. Sheldon matched it, their fingers linking briefly.

"Yubikiri genman," Tenchi recited, the traditional promise rhyme, then grinned and ran down the steps, leaving the adults in his wake.


The morning passed quietly. Sheldon helped Katsuhito with shrine preparations—nothing elaborate, but the haiden received extra attention, the grounds were swept clean of storm debris, the offering vessels polished to their brightest shine.

"You're preparing for Nobuyuki," Sheldon observed.

"I'm preparing for family." Katsuhito set down the cloth he'd been using. "There's a difference."

"Is there?"

"Nobuyuki is Tenchi's father. But family includes whoever shows up to celebrate a child's birthday." The old priest's gaze was direct. "You're expected. You know this."

Sheldon did know it. That was the strange part—not the expectation, but how natural it felt to accept it.

"What should I know about him? About Nobuyuki?"

Katsuhito considered the question. "He loved my granddaughter absolutely. He lost her too soon. He's raising their son while working long hours in the city, and every weekend he drives three hours each way to spend two days here before driving back." A pause. "He's tired, and grieving, and doing his best. Judge him by that, not by first impressions."

Sheldon remembered their first meeting—Day 20, the wary eyes, the questions that felt like tests. "He was protecting Tenchi."

"He still is. But protection can become suspicion if you let it." Katsuhito returned to his polishing. "Show him who you are. Let him decide what to do with it."

---

#### Scene 25.B: Extra Birthday Celebration

Tenchi came up the shrine steps at a run, school bag bouncing, voice carrying ahead of him.

"I'm back! Is Dad here yet? Is he here?"

"Not yet." Sheldon caught him at the top of the steps, steadying him before he could trip over his own momentum. "He said four o'clock. It's barely two."

"That's forever."

"It's two hours."

"Forever hours." But Tenchi was grinning, too excited to maintain the complaint. "Can we check the gardens while we wait? Both of them? So I know what to show Dad?"

They made the rounds together—rear garden first, where the soil remained stubbornly silent, then the front garden, where the azaleas were beginning to show the first hints of new growth at their pruned tips. Tenchi catalogued everything with the focus of a tour guide preparing his material.

"The azaleas are here, and the camellia is there, and the maybe-maple is over there, and the stone path goes like this—" He traced the curve with his hand. "And Sheldon-san found all of it under the weeds. Like treasure."

"The plants did the hard work," Sheldon said. "I just cleared away what was hiding them."

"That's still important." Tenchi's voice was matter-of-fact. "Hiding something doesn't mean it's not there. Someone has to look."

Sheldon had no response to that. Sometimes children said things that landed with unexpected weight.


The sound of a car engine reached them at ten minutes to four.

Tenchi's head snapped toward the road, his whole body going taut with anticipation. Then he was running—down the shrine path, through the gate, toward the parking area where a familiar sedan was pulling in.

"DAD!"

Sheldon stayed where he was, giving them the moment. He could see Nobuyuki emerging from the car, a large box carefully balanced in his arms, then setting it on the roof to catch his son as Tenchi launched into a full-body hug.

They stayed like that for a long moment—father and son, holding on. Whatever else Sheldon might wonder about Nobuyuki Masaki, this much was clear: the man loved his child absolutely.

Katsuhito appeared beside Sheldon, silent as always. "He drove straight from work. Three hours."

"For a birthday party."

"For his son." Katsuhito's voice was mild. "The party is incidental."

Nobuyuki approached with Tenchi attached to his side like a barnacle, the cake box now held in both hands. He looked tired—the kind of deep tiredness that sleep alone couldn't fix—but his smile when he looked at Tenchi was genuine.

"Tsukino-san." The greeting was polite, neutral. Testing.

"Masaki-san." Sheldon gave a small bow. "Thank you for making the drive."

"Thank you for being here." The words came slowly, as if Nobuyuki was weighing each one. "Tenchi has told me about the gardens. Both of them. Repeatedly."

"He's been working hard."

"So I hear." Nobuyuki's gaze held Sheldon's for a moment—assessing, but not hostile. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy something, because the tension in his shoulders eased slightly. "I understand there's a tour scheduled."

"DAD." Tenchi tugged at his father's sleeve. "The cake first or the tour first?"

"Tour first," Katsuhito said, emerging from the residence. "The cake needs time in the cold box. And your father needs tea before anything else."

Nobuyuki looked at his father-in-law with something that might have been gratitude. "Tea would be welcome."


The garden tour was Tenchi's show.

He led his father through the rear garden first, explaining each row by name ("This is Usagi, like my bunny, and this is Kuma, and the sunflowers are for Mama"), pointing out where the seeds were sleeping, demonstrating the proper watering technique with ceremonial gravity.

Nobuyuki listened with the focused attention of a parent who understood that the content mattered less than the telling. He asked questions—"How deep did you plant them? When will they sprout?"—and received answers that mixed genuine knowledge with five-year-old confidence.

"Sheldon-san showed me everything," Tenchi said, leading them toward the front garden. "He knows about seeds because his hands know things his head didn't learn."

Nobuyuki's eyebrows rose slightly. He glanced at Sheldon.

"He's paraphrasing," Sheldon said. "I have some gardening skill I can't fully explain. It's useful."

"Apparently." Nobuyuki's tone was dry but not unfriendly. "Tenchi says you found plants buried under twenty years of neglect."

"Setsuko Tsukino planted them well. They survived."

They reached the front garden, and Nobuyuki stopped at the edge, his expression shifting as he took in the transformation. The cleared paths. The shaped azaleas. The small camellia, the maybe-maple, the ground cover spreading between the stones.

"This was jungle," he said quietly. "I remember. Kiyone always wanted to restore it, but there was never time."

The name landed softly in the spring air. Kiyone. Tenchi's mother. Nobuyuki's wife.

"The plants she would have found are still here," Sheldon said. "Waiting."

Nobuyuki was silent for a long moment. Then: "Thank you. For finding them."

There was nothing more to say. They stood together in the garden that had waited twenty years to be remembered, while Tenchi pointed out features his father had already seen, filling the silence with the easy chatter of a child who didn't know he was bridging grief.


The cake was chocolate with strawberries, exactly as promised. Six candles stood in a careful circle on top—five for age, one for luck.

Katsuhito lit them with a long match, and the small flames danced in the evening light filtering through the shoji. Tenchi sat before the cake with the reverent attention of someone approaching a sacred ritual.

"Make a wish," Nobuyuki said. "But don't tell us."

"I know." Tenchi closed his eyes, his face screwing up with the intensity of concentrated wishing. Then he took a deep breath and blew.

All six candles went out on the first try.

"I did it!" Tenchi's eyes flew open, checking to make sure. "They all went out! That means my wish comes true!"

"That's the rule," Katsuhito agreed solemnly.

The cake was cut, slices distributed. Sheldon's piece was perfect—of course it was, someone had made it with care—but Nobuyuki's eyes tracked him as he ate, still assessing, still deciding.

"Tenchi says you eat breakfast here every day," Nobuyuki said, his voice casual but his eyes sharp.

"Most days. Katsuhito-san has been kind enough to include me."

"And you've been teaching Tenchi about gardens."

"We've been learning together. He teaches me as much as I teach him."

Something in Nobuyuki's expression shifted—not quite a smile, but something adjacent to it. "He talks about you constantly. On the phone, every evening. 'Sheldon-san said this, Sheldon-san showed me that.' I wasn't sure what to expect."

"What did you expect?"

Nobuyuki set down his fork. "I expected someone who wanted something. People don't appear from nowhere and attach themselves to grieving families without reason."

The observation was fair. Sheldon had thought the same thing, in Nobuyuki's position.

"I didn't appear from nowhere," he said. "I walked from Okayama Station. I was tired, and lost, and Katsuhito-san offered me shelter. The rest happened because your son is impossible not to care about."

Nobuyuki was quiet for a moment. Then: "That's not an explanation."

"No. It's not." Sheldon met his eyes directly. "I don't have a complete explanation. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not a threat to your family. Beyond that, I can only show you who I am, day by day."

The silence stretched. Katsuhito drank his tea. Tenchi, oblivious to the undercurrents, was attempting to eat his second slice of cake with more enthusiasm than technique.

"Kiyone would have liked you," Nobuyuki said finally. "She had no patience for people who wouldn't answer questions directly."

"Is that approval?"

"It's... acknowledgment." Nobuyuki picked up his fork again. "We'll see about approval."

It wasn't trust. Not yet. But it was a door left open, and that was more than Sheldon had expected.


The evening wound down gently.

Nobuyuki helped Tenchi through his bath and into pajamas while Sheldon cleaned up from dinner. Katsuhito disappeared to perform evening rites at the haiden, leaving the household to its domestic rhythms.

When Sheldon finished in the kitchen, he found Nobuyuki on the engawa, watching the stars emerge over the shrine compound. The man looked less tired now—still weary, but the sharp edges had softened.

"He's asleep," Nobuyuki said. "Crashed about thirty seconds after his head hit the pillow. Birthday exhaustion."

"It was a big day for him."

"Yes." Nobuyuki was quiet for a moment. "I can't be here as much as I should be. Work, the commute, the apartment in the city—it doesn't leave room for daily presence. Katsuhito does what he can, but he's not young, and Tenchi needs..."

He trailed off. Sheldon waited.

"Tenchi needs people," Nobuyuki finished. "People who see him. Who listen to him. Who take his gardens and his stuffed rabbit and his endless questions seriously." A pause. "You do that."

"He makes it easy."

"He makes it necessary. Not the same thing." Nobuyuki turned to face Sheldon directly. "I don't know who you are or where you came from. I don't know why you're here. But my son is happier than he's been in months, and that matters more than answers."

Sheldon said nothing. There was nothing adequate to say.

"I'll be back next weekend," Nobuyuki continued. "And the weekend after that. If you're still here, still... whatever this is... we'll talk more. But for now—" He extended his hand. "Thank you. For the gardens. For the time. For taking him seriously."

Sheldon shook it. "Thank you for trusting him to show me."

Nobuyuki almost smiled. "I didn't have much choice. He decided you were worth knowing. Five-year-olds are very certain about these things."

He went inside to check on Tenchi one more time. Sheldon stayed on the engawa, watching the stars wheel overhead, thinking about trust and family and the strange ways they intersected.

Tomorrow Nobuyuki would drive back to the city. The weekend visits would continue, the gradual building of something that might someday be trust. And Sheldon would be here, day by day, showing who he was.

It was enough. For now, it was enough.

#### Scene 26: Twenty Sixth Day

Nobuyuki left before breakfast.

Sheldon came up the shrine path to find him loading his bag into the sedan, Tenchi clinging to his leg with the determined grip of someone who understood that letting go meant waiting.

"I'll call tonight," Nobuyuki was saying, one hand resting on his son's head. "And I'll be back next weekend. Same as always."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi accepted this with the gravity of a diplomat receiving a treaty. He released his father's leg and stepped back, allowing the door to close.

Nobuyuki's eyes found Sheldon across the courtyard. A nod—brief, acknowledging—and then the engine turned over and the car disappeared down the mountain road.

"He always has to go," Tenchi said, his voice matter-of-fact rather than sad. "But he always comes back."

"That's how it works with family that lives far away."

"Is your family far away?"

The question landed unexpectedly. Sheldon considered it—his grandmother, decades gone; his parents, never close; his previous life, impossibly distant in ways that had nothing to do with miles.

"Yes," he said finally. "Very far away."

Tenchi absorbed this, then reached up and took Sheldon's hand. "Then we can be your close-by family. So you don't have to wait too long."

There was nothing to say to that. Sheldon let his hand be held and walked with Tenchi to check the garden.


Day 5 of the garden watch. Still no sprouts.

"Soon," Tenchi said, with the confidence of someone who had decided the universe would cooperate. "Usagi is almost ready. I can tell."

"How can you tell?"

"The soil looks different. Darker in the middle."

Sheldon looked. The soil looked exactly the same as it had yesterday, and the day before. But he nodded anyway.

"You might be right."

The day unfolded quietly after that. Tenchi went to kindergarten with Usagi the bunny in his backpack. Sheldon worked on the front garden—pruning the maybe-maple, which was definitely a maple now that he could see its distinctive leaf shape emerging. Katsuhito appeared occasionally, observed, offered the occasional comment, and disappeared again.

By evening, the routine had reasserted itself: dinner at the shrine, garden watering, goodnight to the seeds, the walk home in the gathering dark.

Hikaru met him at the door with reproachful meowing—the food bowl was empty and this was apparently an unforgivable oversight.

"I was busy," Sheldon told him.

The cat was not interested in excuses.

#### Scene 27: Twenty Seventh Day Showa

The village was quiet for the holiday.

Showa Day—the first Showa Day, technically, since Emperor Hirohito had died in January and this was the first observance of what had been his birthday. Sheldon remembered reading about the transition in a newspaper that felt like it belonged to another life. The Heisei era was only four months old.

No school for Tenchi, which meant he appeared at the Tsukino house shortly after dawn, still in his pajamas, announcing that they should check the garden immediately because holidays were lucky and maybe the seeds knew it was special.

They checked. Day 6. Still nothing visible.

"Tomorrow," Tenchi said. "Tomorrow for sure."

"What makes you sure about tomorrow?"

"Because tomorrow is the last day of April. And Usagi wants to see the sun before May."

The logic was impeccable in its own five-year-old way.

They spent the morning exploring the village—a rare excursion that Katsuhito encouraged with a wave and a comment about boys needing to see more than shrines and gardens. Tenchi served as tour guide, pointing out the important landmarks: the convenience store where his father bought him candy, the bridge where you could see fish if you looked at the right time, the house where an old woman had a dog that barked at everything.

Sheldon let himself be led, storing details, building a map of the place that was becoming home.

Lunch was at the shrine—cold soba noodles, appropriate for the warming weather. Tenchi ate with the distracted energy of someone already thinking about the next thing.

"What if they never wake up?" he asked suddenly. "The seeds. What if they stay asleep forever?"

"They won't."

"But what if?"

Sheldon set down his chopsticks. "Then we'd plant new ones. And wait again. And keep waiting until something grew."

"That sounds hard."

"It is hard. That's why it matters when it works."

Tenchi considered this, noodles forgotten. "Like Dad coming back every weekend? That's hard but it matters?"

"Exactly like that."

The afternoon passed in the gentle rhythm of a holiday: no obligations, no urgency, just time and the people who filled it. They watered the garden at sunset, said goodnight to the seeds, and Sheldon walked home under a sky that was beginning to fill with stars.

One more day. Then May.

#### Scene 28: Last Day April FINALE

The morning was cool and clear, the kind of spring day that felt like a held breath before summer's exhale.

Sheldon woke early—earlier than usual—with a sense of something impending that he couldn't name. Hikaru was already at the window, watching the light strengthen, and when Sheldon rose, the cat gave him a look that seemed to say *about time*.

He dressed, fed the cat, and walked to the shrine.

Tenchi was waiting. Not at the garden this time, but at the top of the shrine steps, bouncing on his heels with barely contained energy.

"I didn't look yet," he said as Sheldon approached. "I waited. So we could see together."

"That was very patient of you."

"It was VERY hard." Tenchi grabbed his hand. "Come on. Come *on*."

They walked to the rear garden together, Tenchi's grip tight, his whole body vibrating with anticipation. The soil was dark from the morning dew, the rows still clearly marked, everything exactly as it had been yesterday and the day before and the day before that.

Except.

"Sheldon-san." Tenchi's voice had dropped to a whisper. "Sheldon-san, *look*."

In the first row—Usagi's row, the radishes—a tiny curve of green had broken the surface. Then another. And another. A dozen pale stems, barely visible, pushing up through the dark earth toward the light.

"They woke up," Tenchi breathed. "They *woke up*."

He dropped to his knees at the edge of the garden, face inches from the sprouts, as if closer observation might reveal the actual moment of emergence. His expression held wonder and triumph and something deeper—the particular joy of patience rewarded.

"You grew," he told the sprouts. "You finally grew. I knew you would. I *knew* it."

Sheldon crouched beside him, looking at the tiny green threads that had pushed through darkness into light. Seven days. Seven days of watching and waiting and saying goodnight, and here was the proof that waiting worked.

"The carrots will be next," he said. "Then the sunflowers."

"Kuma is slower," Tenchi agreed. "But she's trying. I can tell."

They stayed there for a long time, watching the sprouts that weren't doing anything visible but somehow demanded watching anyway. Eventually Katsuhito appeared on the engawa, observed the scene, and made that thoughtful sound that Sheldon had learned to recognize.

"The first sprouts," he said. "A good omen for May."

"They woke up for the last day of April," Tenchi said. "Just like I said they would."

"You did say that."

Tenchi stood, brushing dirt from his knees, his face split by a grin that seemed too large for his small frame. "I'm going to tell Dad. Can I use the phone? He has to know about Usagi right away."

"It's early—"

"He won't mind. Not for this."

He ran toward the shrine residence, leaving Sheldon and Katsuhito alone at the garden's edge. The sprouts swayed slightly in the morning breeze, impossibly fragile, impossibly present.

"One month," Katsuhito said quietly.

"One month."

"You've become part of this place. You know that."

Sheldon didn't answer. The sprouts were answer enough—things planted, things tended, things that grew whether you understood how or not.

Tomorrow would be May. New days, new growth, new complications he couldn't foresee. But today was the last day of April, and the seeds had woken up, and a five-year-old boy was calling his father to share the news.

It was enough.

It was more than enough.
