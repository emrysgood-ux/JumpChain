# Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Comprehensive Jump Mechanics & 1000-Year Planning

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Compiled:** December 29, 2025  
**Scope:** Death → Arrival → Pre-Canon → Canon → Post-Canon → Departure

---

## PART I: JUMP MECHANICS EXTRACTION

### 1.1 Jump Structure (Per Source Document)

The Tenchi Muyo! Jump offers **Two Jumps in One**:

| Mode | Duration | Starting CP | Drawback Cap |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Slice of Life | 10 years | +1000cp | +400cp |
| Space Opera | 10 years | +800cp | +800cp |
| Endgame | 10 years | 0cp (one free Ultimatum perk) | N/A |

**Standard Completion Path:**
- Complete Slice of Life OR Space Opera (10 years)
- Return for the other mode (10 more years)
- After 20 years total: Eligible for Endgame Scenario
- Maximum standard duration: **30 years**

**CRITICAL FOR STORY:**
The 1000-year duration indicates Sheldon chose **"This Side Up"** (stay for lifetime) with Cosmos arranging special departure conditions. The Jump framework provides his power scaffolding, but his arrangement with Cosmos supersedes standard Jump completion timelines.

---

### 1.2 Sheldon's Origin: DROP-IN

Based on story circumstances (human from Earth, arrived mysteriously via Cosmos), Sheldon is a **Drop-In**:

**Drop-In Benefits:**
- No extra memories to confuse identity
- Can handwave equipment as "from some other system"
- Automatically learns Japanese
- No institutional blindness (sees solutions others miss)

**Drop-In Disadvantages:**
- No in-universe contacts or documentation
- Must explain abilities/equipment through fast talking or stealth
- No established identity or resources

---

### 1.3 Perk Analysis (Drop-In Track)

| Cost | Perk | Slice of Life Effect | Space Opera Effect |
|------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 100cp | **Trained in the Old Ways** | Unexpected methodology, sees interesting solutions | Wildcard common sense for big problems |
| 200cp | **Civilian Savvy** | Street-smarts, adapts quickly to new situations | Logistics mastery, respected by middle managers |
| 400cp | **Exceptional Company** | Best of best gravitate toward you; engaged to 2+ nobles | Rub elbows with high society; date 2+ exceptional people weekly |
| 600cp | **The UnChousin One** | Ignored by higher beings, concealment from prognostics | Talent for disrupting plans, spotting hidden elements |
| 800cp | **Long Lost Last Noble Heir to the Dojo** | Inherited titles, bloodlines, seats on councils | Only holder of lost skill/combat art; once-per-opponent instant technique |

**SPECULATION FOR SHELDON'S BUILD:**
Given Cosmos's involvement and his role as her "first son," likely perks:
- **The UnChousin One** (concealment from Chousin observation)
- **Exceptional Company** (explains why best characters gravitate to him)
- **Long Lost Noble Heir** (Tsukino family represents genuine bloodline via Cosmos)

---

### 1.4 Ultimatum Perks (Post-20 Years)

These unlock after completing both Slice of Life and Space Opera modes:

| Perk | Powers Granted |
|------|----------------|
| **What Has Science Done?!** | Ryoko's powers: self-duplication (2 copies within 50 yards), phasing through matter, regeneration (can restore total body mass dozens of times), energy swords, concussive blasts, merging with inanimate matter |
| **Dimensional Technology Mastery** | 5th-12th dimensional tech: subspaces, space-folding, vast pocket dimensions, escape from higher powers temporarily |
| **Wings of the Lighthawk** | Manifest LHW without treeship: starts at 1 wing, trains to 3 by end of 10 years. Wings defend against infinite minor attacks, can convert to armor/weapons with Planck-length edges |

**FOR STORY:** Sheldon's path to 13 Lighthawk Wings suggests **Wings of the Lighthawk** as his Ultimatum selection, with additional growth via Celestial Pack grants.

---

### 1.5 Relevant Gear Options

| Item | Cost | Effect | Story Relevance |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Smiling Goddess Leaves** | 400cp (Jurian) | 1st Gen Sentient Tree sapling; halts aging of bonded companions; heals 3x faster; tree matures in 100 years | Potential longevity source |
| **Master Key** | 300cp (Drop-In discount) | Jurian artifact from 1st Gen tree; admin access to 2nd gen treeships; can generate energy sword and personal shield | Possible Cosmos-granted item |
| **Subspace Onsen** | 100cp | Infinite hot water retreat; connects to Warehouse; expands to infinite occupants | Potential relaxation space |
| **Control Cube** | 100cp (GP free) | Supertech interface; 3 cubic yards dimensional pocket; can hide dimensionally | Utility item |

---

### 1.6 Drawbacks (Potential Complications)

| Drawback | CP | Effect | Trigger |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **Hopeless Suitor** | +200cp | Someone wants to marry you; appears at Year 3 with wedding intentions | Story complication |
| **Multiple Spouses** | +200cp | Two fiances with feuding families | Escalation option |
| **Hunted** | +300cp | Galaxy-known super-criminal targets you starting Year 4 | Pre-canon tension |
| **God-Emperor of Jurai** | +300cp | Hostile Tenchi as Emperor, gains LHW each year from Year 4 | Would contradict story structure |
| **The OTHER Chousin One** | +750cp | You're an "Additional Tenchi" for million-year Chousin experiment | May explain Cosmos's interest |

**STORY NOTE:** "The OTHER Chousin One" aligns with Cosmos making Sheldon her "first son" — he may be her counter-move in the Chousin experiment.

---

### 1.7 Ending Options

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **No Need for You** | Return home after Jump completion |
| **This Side Up** | Stay for lifetime in Tenchi universe |
| **The Jumper Solution** | Take companions, continue JumpChain |

**SHELDON'S PATH:** "This Side Up" with Cosmos-arranged departure at Year 1000, approximately 3 months after Yosho's death (~2989).

---

## PART II: DUAL POWER SYSTEM

### 2.1 System Architecture

Sheldon operates under **TWO STACKING POWER SYSTEMS:**

| System | Source | Status at Arrival | Unlock Condition |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Jump Perks** | JumpChain document | LOCKED | Cosmos must establish communication (~Year 1 anniversary) |
| **Celestial Pack** | Cosmos grants (Grimoire, Forge, etc.) | ACTIVE | Granted strategically outside Jump structure |

**KEY INSIGHT:** Jump Perks represent the baseline framework. Celestial Pack grants represent Cosmos's strategic investments in her champion, operating independently of Jump rules.

---

### 2.2 Jump Perk Unlock Timeline

| Phase | Years | Jump Perks Available |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Pre-Unlock | 0-1 | NONE — Sheldon operates as exceptional human only |
| Initial Unlock | 1 | Basic perks activate (origin + tier 1-2) |
| Progressive | 2-20 | Higher tier perks phase in with development |
| Ultimatum | 20+ | Final perk selection available |

---

### 2.3 Celestial Pack Confirmed Grants (~44 Total)

The Celestial Pack abilities include selections from:
- **Celestial Grimoire** (magical/mystical abilities)
- **Celestial Forge** (crafting/technology abilities)
- Other themed packs

**Grant Categories (per previous documentation):**
1. **Cognitive Enhancement** — Memory, processing, learning
2. **Physical Enhancement** — Strength, durability, reflexes
3. **Sensory Enhancement** — Perception, awareness
4. **Social/Mental** — Charisma, influence, mental defense
5. **Supernatural Foundation** — Magic potential, energy manipulation
6. **Utility** — Quality of life, inventory, comfort

**CRITICAL:** Celestial Pack grants are ACTIVE from arrival. They explain why Sheldon can function at exceptional-human level even before Jump perks unlock.

---

### 2.4 Power Phase Integration

| Phase | Years | Jump Status | Celestial Pack Status | Effective Capability |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **I: Dormant** | 1-5 | Locked | Active (subtle) | Exceptional human with enhanced fundamentals |
| **II: Controlled** | 6-12 | Partial unlock | Active (growing) | Enhanced human with strategic advantages |
| **III: Active Defense** | 13-25 | Full unlock | Significant | 1-3 LHW manifestation |
| **IV: Full Integration** | 26-40 | Complete | Mature | 5-10 LHW capacity |
| **V: True Awakening** | 70-80+ | Transcended | Mastered | All 13 LHW access |

---

3. His baseline humanity before transformation
4. Emotional anchors to his original life

---

### 3.2 Cosmos Encounter

---

### 3.3 Resurrection Mechanics

**Physical Reconstruction:**

**What Stays:**
- All major canon events still occur

| **Ryoko** | Cave awakening | Same, but Sheldon may witness or be present |
| **Ayeka** | Arrives seeking Yosho | Sheldon's knowledge of Yosho creates tension |
| **Sasami** | With Ayeka | Immediate connection with expanded household |
| **Mihoshi** | Crash landing | Galaxy Police introduction |
