## SCENE S001: WAKING TO UGUISU
**Time:** 05:48:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The bird woke him.

Three ascending notes in the gray light. Ho-hokekyo. The Japanese bush warbler announcing dawn to anyone who would listen. He lay still beneath the futon covers, orienting himself to consciousness in stages.

Ceiling beams above. Cedar scent from wood that had aged for decades. The soft cotton of the yukata Katsuhito had provided, still wrapped around him from the night before when he had crawled beneath these covers exhausted from a day that should not have been possible.

Day two.

He was still here.

---

## SCENE S002: PHYSICAL ORIENTATION
**Time:** 05:50:12 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

His body reported its status without prompting.

Bladder pressure. Moderate. The universal morning priority that transcended death and resurrection and whatever category his situation occupied. His muscles carried no soreness from yesterday's climb up three hundred twenty steps, though they should have. His joints offered no complaint from a night spent on a floor that, while cushioned by futon, remained fundamentally harder than any mattress he had slept on in his previous life.

This body operated without the accumulated grievances his old one had carried. Thirty-seven years of sedentary academic work had left that frame creaking and protesting every morning. This one simply functioned.

He flexed his fingers beneath the covers. Ten digits responding to neural commands with a precision he had not experienced since his twenties. He curled his toes. Same response. The proprioceptive feedback arrived clean and immediate, no static in the signal.

Whatever had rebuilt him had done thorough work.

---

## SCENE S003: DREAM PROCESSING
**Time:** 05:52:18 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The dream lingered.

His grandmother's kitchen in Griffin. Yellow light through gingham curtains, the smell of biscuits baking, her voice carrying the particular warmth she reserved for grandchildren she thought were too thin. Dorothy Mae Carter, née Williams, standing at the counter with flour on her apron and wisdom in her eyes.

You always were too stubborn to stay dead.

The words echoed with a clarity that suggested more than ordinary dreaming. He had dreamed of her before, in his first life, especially in the years after her passing in 2019. Those dreams had carried the fuzzy quality of memory reconstructed by a sleeping brain. This one had felt like conversation.

She had died six years before him. Neither of them should be speaking to anyone.

He filed the observation alongside the growing collection of things he could not explain.

---

## SCENE S004: ROOM ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 05:54:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The room remained dim, sunrise not yet complete.

Enough light filtered through the shoji screens to show him the space he had slept in for the second night. Six tatami mats arranged in the standard pattern, their woven surface carrying the scent of old rushes and older care. A low chest of drawers against one wall, its wood dark with age and polish. The oshiire closet where he had found the futon, its sliding doors slightly open from when he had retrieved the bedding last night.

The paper lantern sat on the floor near the door, its candle burned to a stub. He would need more candles. Or he would need to get the electricity working properly, assuming the wiring in this house could be trusted.

The emptiness felt appropriate. He was starting from nothing. Why shouldn't his surroundings match?

---

## SCENE S005: MORNING NECESSITIES
**Time:** 05:55:47 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, toilet area

The toilet demanded attention first.

He pushed back the covers and stood. The yukata shifted around his frame as he rose, the fabric catching briefly on his knee before settling into proper drape. The motion came easy in ways that still startled him.

The toilet was a traditional Japanese squat style, located in a small room off the engawa. He had figured out the mechanics the night before through trial and observation. Remove slippers at the door. Use the dedicated toilet slippers inside, their plastic different from the house slippers for hygienic reasons he understood without having been told. Face the door rather than the wall, a counter-intuitive orientation that apparently aided balance during the squat.

He managed the procedure without incident. His thigh muscles protested the position less than they had the previous night. Practice or accommodation, he could not tell which.

---

## SCENE S006: WATER OBSERVATION
**Time:** 05:57:14 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, toilet area

Cold water from the tap.

He splashed his face, the shock clarifying the last traces of sleep and dream from his thoughts. The water smelled of iron and stone, drawn from the well pump rather than any municipal supply. It tasted clean when he cupped his hands and drank, mineral-rich but not unpleasant.

No hot water heater in this house. The pipes led to the well pump and nowhere else. Another item for whatever list he would eventually need to make. In Georgia, hot water was a given. In this abandoned Japanese farmhouse, it was a renovation project.

The small sink had a wooden frame, its edges smoothed by decades of hands bracing against it. A bar of soap rested in a ceramic dish, the soap new enough that Katsuhito must have placed it here recently. The old priest had been preparing this house for his arrival, whether Katsuhito fully understood what that arrival meant or not.

---

## SCENE S007: MIRROR EXAMINATION
**Time:** 05:59:02 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, toilet area

The mirror above the sink showed him again what he had seen at the shrine bathhouse.

Half-Japanese features, though the exact proportions remained difficult for him to categorize. His mother's people had come from Okinawa, the paperwork in his wallet said, while his father had been American. The face looking back at him carried both heritages in ways he could not quite parse. Black hair with a natural wave. A nose that suggested neither continent exclusively. Skin that would tan easily, given sun.

His eyes caught the morning light.

The silver flecks were still there. Still peripheral. Still vanishing when examined directly.

He tested the observation. Looked away, caught them in his peripheral vision like stars at the edge of a constellation. Looked back, watched them fade into the dark iris like stars overwhelmed by sunrise. The pattern held. Whatever they were, they followed consistent rules.

He filed the observation away.

---

## SCENE S008: VILLAGE SIREN
**Time:** 06:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The siren sounded while he was walking back to the bedroom.

A rising wail from somewhere down the mountain. Not an emergency sound, but a sustained tone that felt almost musical in its intention. It held for thirty seconds, then faded into silence. The echo lingered in the morning air, bouncing off the mountain slopes until it dissipated entirely.

The village wake-up call. Rural Japanese communities using communal signals to structure their days. The knowledge arrived without specific provenance, another fragment of information his benefactor had apparently considered useful.

Six o'clock exactly. The village operated on precise time, synchronized by this sound that reached every household within earshot. He wondered how far the siren carried. He wondered if the farmers in the valley fields paused their work to acknowledge it, or if they had been awake for hours already.

He would learn these rhythms. He had no choice but to learn them.

---

## SCENE S009: FUTON FOLDING
**Time:** 06:02:23 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The futon required proper storage.

The technique came from somewhere. Fold in thirds lengthwise first, the mattress compressing under his hands with the resistance of cotton batting that had served many previous sleepers. Then fold in thirds again widthwise, creating a compact bundle that fit neatly in the oshiire closet alongside the pillow and the outer covers.

Storage conventions mattered in traditional houses. The bedroom served multiple purposes throughout the day, and leaving the futon spread would mark him as lazy, inconsiderate, or foreign in ways he could not afford. First impressions in a small village lasted years.

He arranged the bedding in the closet with the precision of someone who understood that details communicated respect. The top cover folded separately, placed above the mattress. The pillow resting on top where it could be retrieved easily. Everything aligned, everything intentional.

Whether anyone would ever see this closet, he did not know. He did it anyway.

---

## SCENE S010: CLOTHING PROBLEM
**Time:** 06:05:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The yukata would not work for a day's activities.

He stood in the main room, considering his options. The clothes he had awakened in yesterday hung over the back of a chair where he had draped them after bathing at the shrine. Dress shirt. Slacks. The formal attire of a Japanese professional, complete with leather shoes and a thin belt. They had been worn for one impossible day of walking, climbing, sweating. Not dirty exactly, but not fresh either.

He had nothing else.

The house held no clothing that fit him. He had checked the night before, opening every drawer and closet in search of something practical. The previous residents had taken everything when they left, or their belongings had been cleared out during whatever transition had occurred between their departure and his arrival.

His wallet held money. But the village had no stores that would be open at this hour, and he had no idea what sizes this body required.

The dress shirt would have to serve.

---

## SCENE S011: HOUSE CATALOG START
**Time:** 06:08:41 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

He moved through the house with purpose.

Running water from the well pump worked. He had tested that last night and again this morning. The handle required priming if left unused too long, but the mechanism functioned without obvious leaks or pressure problems.

The gas lines appeared connected but he was not ready to test them without guidance. Gas in Japan meant propane in tanks or municipal supply, and he could not tell which system this house used. Attempting to light an old stove without understanding the connections risked explosion or carbon monoxide, neither of which appealed.

Electricity functioned in some outlets but not others. The light in the main room worked. The outlet near the kitchen did not. Either the wiring had failed in specific sections, or someone had disconnected circuits deliberately. He would need to trace the lines to understand the pattern.

The kitchen held nothing edible. Empty cupboards. Clean surfaces. A refrigerator that did not run, either because it was broken or because the power to that outlet had failed.

His stomach reminded him of biological requirements. Fifty minutes felt like a long time to wait.

---

## SCENE S012: TIME CHECK
**Time:** 06:12:08 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The clock on the wall showed 6:12.

Mechanical, spring-wound, the kind that would work without electricity. Its face had faded from white to cream over decades, the numbers in a style that suggested manufacture before the war. The second hand swept smoothly around the dial, marking time with a soft tick that filled the quiet house.

Forty-eight minutes until he was expected at the main house for breakfast. Katsuhito had been specific about the time. Seven o'clock. Come for breakfast. The invitation had been delivered with the matter-of-fact hospitality of a host who expected compliance, not gratitude.

He had forty-eight minutes to fill. In his previous life, he would have checked email, scrolled through news feeds, or opened a paper to review before the day properly began. Here he had an empty house and his own thoughts for company.

He decided to explore.

---

## SCENE S013: KITCHEN INSPECTION
**Time:** 06:14:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

The kitchen occupied the northeast corner of the house.

Traditional placement, he knew without knowing how. North-facing kitchens stayed cooler in summer, reducing food spoilage before refrigeration became common. The northeast orientation caught morning light through a window that faced the mountain slope, providing illumination without the afternoon heat that a southern exposure would bring.

The cupboards had been built into the walls rather than standing free. Their doors opened on wooden hinges that squeaked with age, revealing shelves that held nothing but dust and the occasional dried leaf that had found its way inside through some gap he could not identify.

A single counter ran along the east wall, its surface worn smooth by decades of food preparation. The wood had been stained dark with use, and he could see the faint marks where knives had scarred it during cutting work. Someone had cooked thousands of meals on this counter. Someone had fed a family here.

The absence pressed against him like weight.

---

## SCENE S014: WATER PUMP TEST
**Time:** 06:17:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

He tested the water pump again.

The handle required three strokes to prime, air hissing out of the spout before water followed. The first flow came cloudy with sediment that had settled overnight, but cleared after a few seconds of continuous pumping. The water splashed into the sink basin, an old ceramic affair with a drain that led somewhere beneath the house.

Pressure seemed adequate. Volume seemed adequate. The pump itself showed no visible rust or damage, its cast iron construction having survived whatever years of disuse this house had endured.

He let the water run until it came clear and cold, then stopped pumping and watched the flow diminish. No leaks from the handle mechanism. No spray from damaged seals. The system worked.

Water was not going to be his first problem. That was something.

---

## SCENE S015: GAS LINE OBSERVATION
**Time:** 06:19:45 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

The gas lines ran along the base of the wall.

Copper tubing, aged green with oxidation but apparently intact. He traced the pipes with his eyes from where they emerged through the wall to where they connected to the stove. The connections looked tight, no obvious gaps or corrosion at the joints.

The stove itself was a two-burner affair, its surface coated in years of cooking residue that had hardened into a protective layer. The control knobs turned smoothly when he tested them without igniting, suggesting that the valves still functioned even if he had no way to know about the gas supply.

Outside, he had seen no propane tank. Which meant either municipal gas supply or a tank located somewhere he had not yet discovered. He would need to ask Katsuhito. He would need guidance before he attempted to cook anything.

For now, he left the stove untouched.

---

## SCENE S016: ELECTRICAL TEST
**Time:** 06:22:18 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

The outlet near the counter was dead.

He had brought the paper lantern with him, its candle replaced with a fresh one from a pack Katsuhito had provided. By its light, he examined the outlet. Two-pronged, Japanese standard, the plastic housing yellowed with age but not cracked. He pressed his ear close and heard nothing, no hum of current that sometimes indicated live wires.

The outlet by the refrigerator position was also dead. The one near the door worked, a small lamp he had found in the storage room lighting immediately when plugged in. The wiring in this house followed a pattern he could not yet discern.

He would need to trace the circuits. He would need to find the breaker box, assuming the house had one. He would need to understand what worked and what did not before he could plan any proper renovation.

Another item for the list. The list grew longer with every observation.

---

## SCENE S017: HUNGER AWARENESS
**Time:** 06:24:51 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

His stomach growled.

A low rumble that echoed in the empty house, reminding him that bodies required fuel regardless of their origin. He had eaten dinner last night at the main house, Katsuhito's simple but filling meal of rice and vegetables and fish. That had been fourteen hours ago. His metabolism apparently operated on normal human requirements.

He drank water from the kitchen pump, the cold liquid filling his stomach temporarily without addressing the underlying need. The sensation of hunger felt familiar and unfamiliar simultaneously. Familiar in its biological imperative. Unfamiliar in its intensity. His previous body had grown accustomed to academic schedules that often skipped breakfast and delayed lunch. This body seemed to expect regular feeding.

Twenty-five minutes until breakfast. He could manage twenty-five minutes.

---

## SCENE S018: ENGAWA VIEW
**Time:** 06:27:14 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The engawa offered a view of morning light advancing across the mountain slope.

He slid open the shoji screens and stepped out onto the wooden veranda that wrapped around two sides of the house. The boards creaked under his weight, some of them noticeably softer than others where moisture had begun its slow work of rot. Another repair needed. Another item for the list.

The garden beyond had run wild. What might once have been careful arrangements of stone and moss had surrendered to the advancing forest, bamboo grass choking the pathways and volunteer trees pushing up through what had been open ground. He could see traces of the original design if he looked carefully. A stepping stone there. A weathered lantern there. The skeleton of intention beneath the chaos of neglect.

The air smelled of damp earth and green growth. Spring in Japan, the season of renewal that his knowledge told him would bring cherry blossoms and warming days. He breathed deeply and let the morning fill his lungs.

---

## SCENE S019: MORNING SOUNDS
**Time:** 06:30:02 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Birds filled the silence that humans had left behind.

The uguisu continued its song somewhere in the trees, the three-note call repeating at intervals that suggested territory declaration rather than alarm. Other voices joined it. A crow cawing from further down the mountain, its harsh sound carrying clearly in the still air. Smaller birds whose songs he could not identify, chirps and trills that wove together into a chorus no composer could have arranged.

He sat on the engawa edge, his feet dangling above the overgrown garden, and listened. In Griffin, he had grown accustomed to the sounds of civilization. Traffic, voices, the hum of air conditioning units, the distant thrum of the interstate. In Fairbanks, he had known wind and the creak of cold buildings and the occasional howl of a husky from the kennels near campus.

Here the sounds were older. Here the sounds belonged to a world that had existed before humans and would continue after they departed.

---

## SCENE S020: LIGHT OBSERVATION
**Time:** 06:33:29 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The sun had not yet cleared the mountain ridge.

Eastern light filtered through the trees, casting long shadows across the garden that shortened as he watched. The quality of the illumination differed from anything he had known. Georgia light had been thick, heavy with humidity that softened edges and muted colors. Alaska light had been thin, sharp, the product of air so cold it seemed to slice rather than flow.

Japan light, at least here in the mountains, fell somewhere between. Clear enough to cast definite shadows but warm enough to feel gentle on skin. The colors it revealed seemed accurate rather than enhanced. Green was green. Brown was brown. The sky showed the particular blue of April, not yet the deep summer intensity but no longer the pale gray of winter.

He watched the shadows shorten and felt time passing in a way that clocks could not measure.

---

## SCENE S021: HOUSE SCOPE ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 06:36:47 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The house needed more than he could provide alone.

He walked through the main room again, this time noting not just what existed but what it would take to repair. The ceiling showed water stains in one corner, suggesting roof damage that allowed rain to penetrate. The walls had gaps where the plaster had cracked and fallen away, exposing the bamboo lattice beneath. The floor felt soft in places, boards giving more than they should under his weight.

Structural work required skills he did not possess. He could change a lightbulb. He could paint a wall. He could assemble furniture from a kit if the instructions were clear. He could not rebuild a traditional Japanese house from its foundation up.

He would need help. He would need money. He would need time, and time was the only resource he seemed to have in abundance.

Katsuhito had mentioned a carpenter. He would need to listen carefully when that introduction came.

---

## SCENE S022: STORAGE EXPLORATION
**Time:** 06:39:55 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, storage room

The storage room occupied the northwest corner.

He had glanced inside last night but not properly explored. Now, with enough light filtering through the single small window, he could see what the previous residents had left behind. Tools hung on the wall, their metal surfaces rusted but still recognizable. A handsaw. A hammer. Something that might have been a plane for smoothing wood. A collection of chisels in various sizes, their edges probably too dull for use but their handles worn smooth by long service.

Wooden boxes stacked in one corner held mysteries. He opened the first to find nails, hundreds of them, scattered loose in the box rather than organized by size. The second held screws and bolts, similarly disordered. The third contained what appeared to be door hardware, hinges and handles and catches removed from somewhere and stored for future use that never came.

Someone had been preparing for repairs. Someone had gathered materials and then stopped.

---

## SCENE S023: TOOL IDENTIFICATION
**Time:** 06:42:31 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, storage room

He recognized some tools. Others remained mysterious.

The hammer was universal. Metal head, wooden handle, the balance suggesting quality manufacture even through the rust. The saw had teeth he understood, though the Japanese style differed from American saws in ways he could not quite articulate. Pull cut rather than push cut, maybe. The motion would be different.

One tool looked like a curved knife with a short handle. He had no name for it. Another resembled a large chisel but with a blade angled in a way that suggested specific purpose. A third was simply a metal bar with a forked end, its function obvious only when he imagined prying boards apart.

His knowledge had gaps. His benefactor had provided information about Japanese culture, language, history. Had apparently not considered carpentry essential enough to include in the download. Fair enough. He would learn the old way. By watching. By asking. By failing and trying again.

---

## SCENE S024: DUST OBSERVATION
**Time:** 06:45:08 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, storage room

Dust covered everything.

Years of it, settled into a gray blanket that recorded every disturbance. His footprints showed clearly on the floor. His handprints marked the boxes he had opened. The dust told the story of abandonment more clearly than any calendar could.

How long had this house stood empty? The dust suggested years, but dust accumulated at different rates depending on conditions. The storage room had a window that did not seal properly, allowing air to carry particles inside. The main house might tell a different story.

He brushed dust from the hammer handle and felt the wood beneath. Solid. Uncracked. Ready for use if the head could be cleaned and the balance restored. Tools lasted longer than people. Tools remembered how to do their work even when their owners had forgotten.

He set the hammer back on its hook and continued his exploration.

---

## SCENE S025: INHERITANCE WEIGHT
**Time:** 06:47:42 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, storage room

This had been someone's life.

The tools. The boxes of supplies. The careful arrangement that had surrendered to years of neglect. Someone had lived here, worked here, built here. Someone had maintained this house and these grounds with the intention of passing them to the next generation.

His mother's family, according to the paperwork in his wallet. Yuki Tsukino, maiden name unknown, had married Takeo Chiba and then James Carter. Her family had owned this house, this land, this collection of tools and boxes and accumulated preparation. They had died or moved or simply stopped coming, and the house had waited.

Now it waited for him.

The weight of inheritance pressed against him. He had done nothing to earn this. He had been given it by forces he did not understand for reasons he could not fathom. The house did not know that. The house only knew that someone had finally come.

---

## SCENE S026: RETURN AND PROCESSING
**Time:** 06:50:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

He returned to the main room and stood still.

The clock showed 6:50. Ten minutes until he should leave for the main house. Ten minutes to process what he had observed and begin forming the mental framework that would guide his work here.

The house needed a roof. That was primary. Katsuhito had mentioned rainy season, and water damage would accelerate every other problem. After the roof, the floors. After the floors, the walls. After the walls, the systems. Water. Gas. Electricity. In that order, because water was essential, gas was useful, and electricity was convenient.

He could build a sequence. He could create a project plan. His academic training had prepared him for nothing practical, but it had taught him how to break large problems into manageable components and attack them systematically.

The house was a research project. The methodology would be the same.

---

## SCENE S027: DEPARTURE PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:52:38 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, entrance

He gathered what he needed for the walk to the main house.

The paper lantern, though useless in daylight, should be returned to Katsuhito. The candle stub inside could be replaced with something fresh. The lantern itself showed craftsmanship in its bamboo frame and paper panels, the kind of simple object that became beautiful through careful making.

He checked his appearance in the small mirror by the entrance. Dress shirt slightly wrinkled but acceptable. Hair finger-combed into reasonable order. Face showing the slight shadow of stubble that this body apparently grew, though not quickly enough to require immediate attention.

He looked like a man who had slept in a traditional Japanese house and was trying to present himself respectably despite limited resources. Which was exactly what he was.

---

## SCENE S028: WALK BEGINS
**Time:** 06:48:15 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

The morning air carried the night's residual cool.

He walked the path connecting his house to the shrine residence, the lantern swinging gently in his left hand. The path wound through trees that filtered the strengthening sunlight into patterns on the ground, shifting as breeze moved branches above. His leather shoes, designed for office floors and paved streets, found the stone path acceptable but not ideal.

Cherry blossoms caught the early light overhead. The trees were past peak bloom, he thought, their branches showing more green than pink as leaves began to replace flowers. Petals drifted in the breeze, some landing on his shoulders and hair, others settling on the path ahead of him.

He walked through falling petals and felt something shift in his chest that he could not name.

---

## SCENE S029: CHERRY BLOSSOMS
**Time:** 06:50:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

A few petals had landed on the path during the night.

They formed pale constellations against the dark stone, their arrangement random but suggesting patterns if he looked at them sideways. The human mind finding meaning in chaos. The tendency that had driven him to physics, to the search for underlying order in apparent randomness.

He bent to pick up a single petal. The texture was soft, almost silken, the color a pink so pale it verged on white. The edges had begun to brown where the flower was dying, its brief life reaching its natural end.

Cherry blossoms lasted a week at most. The Japanese had built an entire aesthetic around their transience, mono no aware, the bittersweet awareness of impermanence. He had read about this. He had not expected to feel it.

He let the petal fall and continued walking.

---

## SCENE S030: STREAM CROSSING
**Time:** 06:52:48 JST  
**Location:** Stream between properties

The stream crossing required attention.

The stones were damp with morning dew, their surfaces slick enough to punish carelessness. He picked his way across carefully, the water running clear and cold beneath. The stream was narrow here, maybe four feet across, but the stones placed for crossing had been chosen for stability rather than convenience. They did not form an obvious path so much as a suggestion that passage was possible.

His leather shoes found uncertain grip on the wet stone. He placed each foot deliberately, shifting weight only when he was sure of the next position. The water below showed fish, small dark shapes hovering in the current, disturbed by his shadow passing over them.

He reached the far bank without incident and paused to shake moisture from his soles.

---

## SCENE S031: PATH OBSERVATION
**Time:** 06:54:33 JST  
**Location:** Path to shrine grounds

The path continued through a different kind of forest.

On the Tsukino House side, the trees had been allowed to grow wild, bamboo grass encroaching from all sides. On the shrine side, the forest showed evidence of maintenance. The ground cover was trimmed. The path edges were clear. The trees grew in patterns that suggested planting rather than accident.

Someone had been tending these grounds for a long time. Katsuhito, presumably, maintaining the approach to his shrine with the same attention he gave to everything else. The path spoke of discipline and continuity, of work performed day after day without expectation of completion.

He walked the maintained path and felt the difference beneath his feet. Smooth stone here. Careful placement. The labor of years made visible in every step.

---

## SCENE S032: SHRINE VIEW OPENS
**Time:** 06:56:18 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds approach

The shrine grounds opened before him.

The trees gave way to cleared space, and he could see the compound laid out in its entirety. The main shrine building stood at the highest point, its vermillion torii gate marking the boundary between secular and sacred space. The residential buildings clustered below it, connected by covered walkways and stone paths. Smoke rose from the bathhouse chimney, Katsuhito maintaining the traditional rhythms even when no visitors were expected.

The main residence showed light in the kitchen window. A warm yellow glow that suggested activity and welcome. Someone was awake. Someone was preparing for his arrival.

He adjusted his grip on the lantern and quickened his pace slightly. Seven o'clock approached, and Katsuhito struck him as a man who valued punctuality.

---

## SCENE S033: GROUNDS APPROACH
**Time:** 06:57:41 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds

The shrine grounds carried their own atmosphere.

He could feel the change as he crossed some invisible boundary, the air itself seeming to thicken with accumulated intention. Centuries of prayer had soaked into this soil. Centuries of ritual had worn patterns in the stone. The weight of belief, even belief he did not share, pressed against his awareness in ways he could not explain.

The main path led upward toward the shrine proper, the three hundred twenty steps beginning their climb at a gate he had ascended yesterday. A secondary path branched toward the residence, and he took this one, his destination the kitchen light rather than the sacred space.

Small details announced themselves. A broom leaning against a wall, its bristles worn from use. A ceramic pot holding water for birds, its surface rippled by a visitor's recent drink. The grounds lived. The grounds were maintained by hands that cared about their preservation.

---

## SCENE S034: KITCHEN LIGHT
**Time:** 06:58:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near residence

The kitchen light meant Katsuhito was awake and working.

He could see movement through the window, a figure passing back and forth with the efficiency of long practice. The old priest had probably risen hours ago, had probably completed his morning prayers and meditation before beginning the mundane work of breakfast preparation. The routines of a lifetime did not alter simply because a strange visitor had appeared.

He wondered what Katsuhito thought of him. The old man had accepted his presence with a hospitality that seemed genuine, but acceptance and understanding were different things. Katsuhito had not asked difficult questions. Katsuhito had provided food and shelter and guidance without demanding explanations.

Perhaps the questions would come later. Perhaps they were already being asked in ways he could not perceive.

---

## SCENE S035: STEPS TO RESIDENCE
**Time:** 06:59:08 JST  
**Location:** Main House approach

Three stone steps led up to the residence entrance.

He climbed them and paused at the genkan, the entry area where shoes were removed and formality began. The sliding door was slightly open, an invitation to announce himself rather than wait outside. He could hear sounds from within. The scrape of a pot on a burner. The soft shuffle of feet on tatami. The rhythms of a household waking to its day.

He cleared his throat softly and spoke the standard greeting. "Ojamashimasu." I am intruding. The polite form that acknowledged the guest's awareness of their imposition on the host's space.

"Sheldon-san." Katsuhito's voice came from the kitchen. "You are precisely on time. Please, enter."

---

## SCENE S036: FORMAL ARRIVAL
**Time:** 07:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, genkan

He stepped into the genkan and removed his shoes.

The leather oxfords looked out of place on the wooden shoe shelf, Western formality amid Japanese simplicity. House slippers waited for him, their size suggesting that Katsuhito had prepared them specifically for a guest of his proportions. He slipped them on and felt the change in his footing, the soft fabric different from leather soles in ways that affected his entire posture.

The lantern in his hand reminded him of his purpose. "I've brought back the lantern. Thank you for lending it."

Katsuhito appeared in the doorway to the kitchen, wiping his hands on a small towel. "Keep it. The Tsukino house needs light more than this one does." He tucked the towel into his obi and nodded toward the interior. "Come. Breakfast is nearly ready."

## SCENE S037: ENTRY PROTOCOL
**Time:** 07:01:18 JST  
**Location:** Main House, genkan to interior

He stepped up from the genkan to the interior floor.

The transition marked another boundary, the formal separation between outside and inside that Japanese architecture made explicit. His slippered feet found smooth wood worn to a gentle shine by generations of footsteps. The hallway led toward the kitchen and the living areas beyond, its walls decorated with calligraphy scrolls and simple ink paintings.

He followed Katsuhito's retreating form, the old man moving with the easy grace of someone who had walked these halls for decades. The residence felt different from the Tsukino house. Not larger, necessarily, but more inhabited. More alive. The presence of people had soaked into the walls here just as surely as prayer had soaked into the shrine grounds.

He carried the lantern still, uncertain where to put it until Katsuhito's words registered. Keep it. A gift, then. A small kindness that cost the giver nothing but meant everything to the receiver.

## SCENE S038: KATSUHITO GREETING
**Time:** 07:02:35 JST  
**Location:** Main House, hallway

"Did you sleep well?"

The question was standard hospitality, but Katsuhito's eyes carried genuine interest. The old man had stopped at the kitchen doorway, turning to face his guest with an attention that suggested the answer mattered.

"I did." The truth, more or less. The dream lingered, but the sleep itself had been deep and restorative. "The house is quiet. It made sleeping easy."

"Too quiet for some." Katsuhito turned back toward the kitchen. "The young find silence uncomfortable. They fill it with noise because they fear what it might reveal." He glanced back. "You are not young, despite your appearance."

The observation landed with precision. He was not young. He had died at thirty-seven and carried those years within a body that seemed to be in its mid-twenties. Katsuhito saw more than he revealed.

---

## SCENE S039: KITCHEN OBSERVATION
**Time:** 07:03:48 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The kitchen occupied a space larger than his entire living quarters at the Tsukino house.

Wooden counters lined three walls, their surfaces showing the patina of constant use. A large sink occupied one corner, fed by pipes that presumably connected to proper running water rather than a hand pump. The stove was modern by comparison to his own, four burners and an oven, propane-fed from a tank he could see through the window outside.

Katsuhito moved through this space with the efficiency of long practice. His hands found tools without looking. His feet carried him between stations without hesitation. The old man had cooked thousands of meals in this kitchen, had developed routines so deep they required no conscious thought.

A pot of miso soup simmered on one burner. A rice cooker on the counter showed the steam of freshly cooked rice. Small dishes held pickles and vegetables arranged with an aesthetic care that seemed instinctive rather than deliberate.

---

## SCENE S040: COOKING OBSERVATION
**Time:** 07:05:12 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

He watched Katsuhito prepare miso soup.

The process was simple but precise. Dashi stock from a pot that had been simmering since before his arrival. Miso paste measured by eye rather than spoon, the old man's fingers knowing the right amount through decades of practice. A gentle stir to dissolve the paste without crushing the delicate silken tofu that floated in the broth.

"The miso is from Kurashiki." Katsuhito offered the information without being asked. "A small producer who still ages it the traditional way. Three years in wooden barrels." He tasted the soup with a small ceramic spoon, nodded approval, and reduced the heat. "Store-bought miso cannot compare."

The knowledge registered. Quality ingredients mattered. Sourcing mattered. The care that went into food before cooking determined the quality of the final dish.

---

## SCENE S041: OFFER TO HELP
**Time:** 07:07:29 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

"May I help with something?"

Katsuhito paused in his work, considering the offer. "Can you prepare rice bowls? Three bowls in the cabinet to your left. Fill each half full from the rice cooker, using the paddle inside."

He found the cabinet and retrieved three ceramic bowls, their glaze showing the subtle variations of handmade pottery. The rice cooker sat on the counter, its lid releasing steam when he lifted it. The rice inside gleamed, each grain distinct yet cohesive, the texture exactly right in ways he recognized without knowing how.

He scooped rice into the first bowl, trying to match the portion he had seen at dinner the night before. The rice released from the paddle with a soft sound, settling into the bowl with the particular weight of properly cooked grain.

"Less for Tenchi." Katsuhito watched without seeming to watch. "A child's portion."

---

## SCENE S042: RICE OBSERVATION
**Time:** 07:09:44 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The rice cooker was not like any he had seen.

In America, rice cookers were electric appliances with digital displays and multiple settings. This one was simpler. A pot with a heavy lid, sitting on a low platform that contained a heating element of some kind. No buttons. No displays. Just a switch and a pilot light.

"Tiger brand." Katsuhito noticed his examination. "Twenty years old and still working perfectly. Japanese engineering means building things that last."

He filled the remaining bowls, adjusting Tenchi's portion smaller as instructed. The rice paddle was wooden, shaped to release rice easily, its surface smooth from thousands of uses. Someone had designed this tool to perform one function perfectly. Someone had thought about rice service with the attention most people reserved for more important matters.

---

## SCENE S043: SCENT ABSORPTION
**Time:** 07:11:58 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The kitchen smelled of miso and rice and something green he could not identify.

His nose separated the components with a precision that surprised him. The fermented richness of the miso, its aroma carrying notes of salt and time and the wooden barrels where it had aged. The clean starch scent of the rice, steam rising in invisible threads. Something vegetal underneath, maybe the pickles, maybe something he had not yet seen.

His previous body had noticed food smells as a category. This one parsed them as data. He could almost taste the soup without tasting it, his olfactory system constructing a prediction of flavor from the aromatic information available.

Was this normal? Was everyone's sense of smell this detailed, and he had simply never paid attention? Or had his benefactor enhanced certain capabilities along with the physical improvements?

Another question without an answer. The list grew longer.

---

## SCENE S044: TENCHI'S ABSENCE
**Time:** 07:13:21 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

"Tenchi is still sleeping?"

Katsuhito nodded while arranging pickles on a small plate. "He will wake soon. Children his age sleep deeply and resist morning with all their strength. It is their nature." A faint smile crossed the old man's face. "I remember when his father was the same. Nobuyuki would hide under his futon and pretend not to hear the wake-up call."

The mention of Tenchi's father caught his attention. He had not met Nobuyuki, knew only that the man worked in the city and visited on weekends. The household contained three generations in its regular population, but only two were present most of the time.

"When does his father visit?"

"This weekend, perhaps. His work keeps him busy." The smile faded slightly. "Too busy, some would say. But a man must provide for his family, and architecture requires presence in the city."

---

## SCENE S045: BREAKFAST ASSEMBLY
**Time:** 07:15:38 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

Breakfast came together through coordinated effort.

Katsuhito transferred the miso soup into three bowls, the liquid steaming as it flowed. He arranged the pickles on a single shared plate that would sit in the center of the table. The rice bowls waited in a row, their contents cooling slightly but still warm.

"The tray." Katsuhito gestured toward a wooden tray hanging on the wall. "We will carry everything together."

He retrieved the tray and watched as Katsuhito arranged the dishes with a geometry that seemed both practical and aesthetic. Soup bowls positioned for easy reach. Rice bowls beside them. Pickles in the center. Chopsticks laid across small ceramic rests, their tips pointing to the left as convention demanded.

The arrangement told a story about meals shared and hospitality extended. Every element had its place. Every placement carried meaning.

---

## SCENE S046: TABLE POSITIONING
**Time:** 07:17:52 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The dining area occupied a corner of the main room.

A low table, chabudai style, sat on the tatami with cushions arranged around it. The wood showed the marks of long use, its surface worn smooth by plates and bowls and the pressure of countless elbows. This was not a showpiece table. This was furniture that worked.

Katsuhito set the tray down and began distributing dishes with movements so practiced they required no thought. Soup here. Rice there. The shared plate in the center where all could reach it. Chopsticks positioned precisely, aligned with the edge of the table rather than angled casually.

"Your place is there." Katsuhito indicated the seat facing the garden window. "The guest position. You will have the best view."

---

## SCENE S047: SEATING PROTOCOL
**Time:** 07:19:08 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

He lowered himself onto the cushion with careful attention to form.

Seiza, the formal kneeling position, seemed expected. He folded his legs beneath him and rested his weight on his heels, the posture uncomfortable but bearable. His previous life had included no such practice. His new body protested but did not rebel.

Katsuhito took his own seat with the fluid ease of someone who had knelt this way for decades. The old man's position looked effortless, his spine straight without stiffness, his hands resting on his thighs with deliberate placement.

The third cushion remained empty. Tenchi's place, waiting for a child who still slept.

"You may sit in a more comfortable position if you prefer." Katsuhito's tone carried no judgment. "Seiza is difficult for those unaccustomed to it."

"I will learn." The words came without planning. A commitment made before he had considered its implications.

---

## SCENE S048: MORNING LIGHT
**Time:** 07:20:25 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The shoji screens admitted morning light in soft filtered waves.

The paper panels glowed with the sunrise, their rice-paper surface transforming direct sunlight into an ambient illumination that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. The effect was peaceful in ways that glass windows could never achieve. The light felt earned rather than simply admitted.

Through gaps where the screens did not quite meet, he could see the garden beyond. Stone. Moss. Carefully trimmed shrubs maintaining shapes that suggested mountains or clouds or nothing at all. The garden existed to be seen from this exact position, its design calculated to provide a view for someone seated at this table.

He wondered how many mornings Katsuhito had spent looking at that garden. Thousands, probably. Tens of thousands. The view would have changed with seasons and years, but its fundamental nature remained constant. Stone endured. Moss grew back. Shrubs could be trimmed into their proper shapes.

---

## SCENE S049: ITADAKIMASU
**Time:** 07:22:41 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"Itadakimasu."

The word emerged from both of them simultaneously. Katsuhito's pronunciation carried the ease of native speech. His own carried the careful precision of learned language, each syllable placed deliberately.

I humbly receive. The standard phrase before eating, acknowledging the food and those who had prepared it. The ritual that transformed consumption into something more than biological necessity.

He picked up his chopsticks and held them properly, the grip coming from somewhere he could not identify. Thumb bracing. Fingers positioned. The lower stick held stationary while the upper one moved to grip. His hands knew this without his mind understanding how.

The first taste of rice would tell him whether his body's requirements matched his expectations.

---

## SCENE S050: FIRST TASTE
**Time:** 07:24:58 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The rice tasted of more than he expected.

Not just starch and mild sweetness. He could taste the water it had been cooked in, the subtle mineral content that gave it character. He could taste the variety itself, the particular strain of rice that Katsuhito had chosen for its quality. He could taste the care that had gone into cooking it, the attention to temperature and timing that had produced this texture.

His previous life had eaten rice as a side dish, an afterthought to whatever main course demanded attention. This rice was the center. Everything else existed to complement it.

He took a second bite and let the flavors register fully. The complexity surprised him. The satisfaction surprised him more. Simple food, prepared well, provided something that elaborate cuisine often missed.

Katsuhito watched him without appearing to watch. The old man had seen his reaction. The old man saw everything.
