- Her own vulnerabilities
- Specific future events

### Why Withheld

## SHELDON'S REACTION

### Immediate Response
- Shock (expected)
- Grief (allowed to process his death)
- Gratitude (someone cared)
- Humor (the Shipping Wars joke lands)
- Acceptance (framework for strange experiences)

### The Name Question
> "Mom feels... strange. You made me, but..."
> "Take your time. There's no hurry."
> "Cosmos, then. For now."

### Processing Period
- Days 366-400: Internal adjustment
- Doesn't change daily behavior
- Internalizes without sharing
- Continues normal life

---

## WHAT CHANGES

### Internal Changes
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Something brought me here" | "Cosmos chose me" |
| "The warmth" | "Lambda Power" |
| "I don't know how I know" | "My abilities" |
| Confusion about purpose | Understanding of role |

### External Changes
**Almost nothing visible.** Sheldon doesn't:
- Announce his nature
- Change behavior dramatically
- Reveal secrets to household
- Act on meta-knowledge

### Why No Visible Change?
- He's had 4 years to adapt
- Confirmation, not transformation
- His life is already built
- Knowledge doesn't change love

---

## THE SHIPPING WARS JOKE

### Context
Cosmos placed Sheldon in Tenchi Muyo specifically.

### The Misunderstanding
- JumpChain document mentions "Shipping Wars"
- Cosmos interpreted as naval conflicts
- Thought Sheldon would appreciate ocean view
- "Shipping" actually means romantic shipping
- Tenchi Muyo famous for harem dynamics

### The Exchange
> "You put me in a HAREM ANIME?"
> "A what?"
> "The... the romantic competition thing. Multiple women fighting over one man."
> "Oh. Oh dear. I thought..." *pause* "The ocean view?"
> "..."
> "I'm not omniscient, you know."

### Why It Matters
- Comic relief after emotional intensity
- Shows Cosmos isn't perfect
- Explains story premise
- Her "mistake" becomes his purpose
- Transforms harem → found family

---

## AFTERMATH

### Days 367-400
- Processing privately
- Same routines externally
- Internal peace achieved
- Questions resolved

### Year 4 Overall
- Tenchi now age 8-9
- Household well-established
- Sheldon's role cemented
- Foundation complete

### Moving Forward
- Quiet Years continue (5-12)
- Knowledge informs but doesn't control
- Waits for right time to share (if ever)
- Life continues, enriched
