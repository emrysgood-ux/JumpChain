### Part 1: Scenes 1-50

**POV:** Sheldon (exclusive)  
**Timeline:** 14:47:23 JST — 15:45:00 JST  
**Coverage:** The Awakening → Field Exit → Road Approach

---

## SCENE 1
**Time:** 14:47:23 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

Green.

The smell was green. Not the word—the color itself pressed against his face, pushed into his nostrils with each shallow breath he didn't remember starting. Chlorophyll and crushed stems. Damp earth beneath that. Something floral, faint, underneath everything else.

He existed.

The thought arrived without context, without the architecture of identity to support it. Just the raw fact: something was here, breathing, smelling green.

---

## SCENE 2
**Time:** 14:47:31 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

His left cheek pressed into soil. Cool. Slightly damp. The texture registered before he understood what texture meant—granular pressure against skin, the particular give of earth that had absorbed recent rain.

Somewhere above him, a bird called. Three notes. Rising, falling, sustained. The pattern meant nothing to him yet.

He breathed. The green smell filled him again.

---

## SCENE 3
**Time:** 14:47:45 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

Fingers.

He had fingers. The knowledge came not from thought but from sensation—five points of contact against grass blades, each finger slightly curled, each one responding to some automatic signal he hadn't consciously sent. His right hand lay somewhere near his face. He could feel the knuckle of his index finger pressing into his cheekbone.

The bird called again. Same three notes. Hō-hoke-kyo.

---

## SCENE 4
**Time:** 14:48:02 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

Language returned in fragments.

*Grass. Earth. Bird.*

The words attached themselves to sensations like labels being affixed to unlabeled boxes. Each connection brought a small shock of recognition—not learning, but remembering. He knew what grass was. He knew what birds were. The knowledge had been there all along, waiting for something to call it forward.

*I.*

The word surfaced last. Heavier than the others. Carrying weight.

---

## SCENE 5
**Time:** 14:48:19 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

His body assembled itself in his awareness piece by piece.

Feet. He had feet. They pointed away from his head at angles that suggested he'd fallen rather than lain down deliberately. Legs attached to the feet, bent slightly at the knees. Hips. Torso. Arms that terminated in the hands he'd already discovered. Head, turned to the left, cheek against earth.

All of it worked. All of it was his.

The bird called. Third time now.

---

## SCENE 6
**Time:** 14:48:34 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

He tried to move his right hand.

It moved.

The response was immediate, precise, without the usual negotiation between intention and execution. Fingers uncurled from the grass. Palm pressed flat against earth. The movement felt like speaking a language he'd always known—no translation required, no processing delay.

His hand was brown. Medium brown, warm undertones visible even against the dark soil.

---

## SCENE 7
**Time:** 14:48:51 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

Breath came deeper now. His lungs expanded without resistance, without the faint catch at full capacity he'd grown accustomed to ignoring. Air moved through passages that felt new-built, unobstructed, operating at some theoretical maximum he'd never experienced.

The incongruity registered but did not yet alarm. He was too busy existing to question the terms of his existence.

---

## SCENE 8
**Time:** 14:49:08 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

He opened his eyes.

Blue.

The sky spread above him at an angle, visible past the grass that surrounded his face like a poorly trimmed beard. Deep blue, the color of mid-afternoon in a latitude that received more direct sunlight than he was used to. A single white cloud drifted at the edge of his vision, moving slowly enough to suggest light winds at altitude.

Not Alaska.

The thought came unbidden. He'd expected Alaska without knowing why.

---

## SCENE 9
**Time:** 14:49:25 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

His eyes worked perfectly.

The realization surfaced slowly, carried on the clarity of what he saw. The grass blades two inches from his face stood in sharp focus. The cloud overhead showed distinct edges. The contrast between blue sky and white vapor held steady without the blur he should have experienced.

He wore no glasses. His face was bare.

And he could see.

---

## SCENE 10
**Time:** 14:49:42 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

Memory returned like a wave breaking over a seawall.

Maria Chen's face. The control room. Readouts climbing past safety thresholds. The cascade failure that should have been impossible—the one he'd modeled a thousand times, the one every safety protocol had been designed to prevent.

Light. Heat. The sensation of being unmade at the atomic level.

He'd died.

---

## SCENE 11
**Time:** 14:49:58 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

The certainty of it settled into him without panic. He had died. The accelerator had failed in exactly the way his models predicted it couldn't. The energy release had been instantaneous, total, unsurvivable.

He remembered the last thing he'd seen: Maria's eyes widening behind the observation window, her hand reaching toward the emergency shutdown that would arrive seventeen milliseconds too late.

October 23rd, 2025. 3:47 PM Alaska Standard Time.

He had died.

---

## SCENE 12
**Time:** 14:50:15 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, face-down in grass

And yet.

He breathed. His heart beat—he could feel it now, steady and strong in his chest, maintaining a rhythm that carried none of the irregular flutter he'd lived with for fifteen years. His body pressed against earth that smelled of spring growth. Above him, the bird called again, patient and unhurried.

He had died. And something that was not death had followed.

---

## SCENE 13
**Time:** 14:50:32 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, attempting to rise

He decided to sit up.

The decision translated to action without the expected delay. His arms pushed against the ground. His core engaged. His torso rose from the earth with a smoothness that felt almost mechanical in its efficiency.

Grass fell away from his face, his chest, his shoulders. Purple flowers—small, delicate—clung to the fabric of his shirt before dropping back to the field.

---

## SCENE 14
**Time:** 14:50:49 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

The world resolved around him.

A field. Ankle-high grass interspersed with those purple flowers—hundreds of them, maybe thousands, spreading in every direction. A treeline to the north, cedar and something deciduous he couldn't immediately identify. Hills rising beyond the trees, covered in the particular green of early spring.

No buildings. No roads visible. No people.

The sun sat in the western quadrant of the sky, suggesting mid-to-late afternoon.

---

## SCENE 15
**Time:** 14:51:06 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

His hands lay in his lap. He looked at them.

Brown skin, unblemished. Short nails, clean. The lines of his palms traced familiar patterns—life line, heart line, the small scar from a paring knife when he was nine.

He turned his right hand over. Looked at the base of his thumb.

No scar.

---

## SCENE 16
**Time:** 14:51:23 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

His thumb had carried that scar for twenty-eight years. A white line, slightly raised, the permanent record of a MIT laboratory accident in 1997. Hot glass, inadequate grip, the way the beaker had shattered and the shard had opened his skin before he'd registered the pain.

Dr. Morrison had driven him to the emergency room. Eight stitches. The scar had stayed with him through everything that followed.

Now his thumb was smooth. Perfect. As if the accident had never happened.

---

## SCENE 17
**Time:** 14:51:40 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

He checked his left hand. Then his forearms, pushing up the sleeves of a white shirt he didn't remember putting on.

No scars anywhere.

The burn mark from a soldering iron, age sixteen—gone. The thin line across his left wrist from a childhood fall—gone. Every small damage his skin had accumulated over thirty-seven years of existence had been erased.

---

## SCENE 18
**Time:** 14:51:57 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

His heart beat steady and true.

He placed his palm flat against his chest, feeling for the irregular skip-beat that had accompanied him since his early twenties. The premature ventricular contractions his cardiologist had called benign but annoying. The small hitch in his cardiac rhythm that reminded him, several times per hour, that his body was imperfect and mortal.

Nothing. Just steady beats. Sixty-two per minute, if his internal counting held accurate.

---

## SCENE 19
**Time:** 14:52:14 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

His back didn't hurt.

The realization came slowly because the absence of pain registered more quietly than pain itself. For seven years, sitting had meant a constant low-grade ache at the L4-L5 junction—the cost of too many hours hunched over keyboards and laboratory equipment. He'd learned to ignore it, to function around it, to accept it as the price of doing the work he loved.

Now he sat on uneven ground with his spine completely straight, and nothing hurt at all.

---

## SCENE 20
**Time:** 14:52:31 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

Someone had fixed him.

The thought arrived without drama, a simple conclusion drawn from accumulated evidence. His scars were gone. His heart worked properly. His back didn't ache. His eyes saw with a clarity he hadn't experienced since childhood.

Someone—something—had taken his broken body and made it whole.

Or made him a new one entirely.

---

## SCENE 21
**Time:** 14:52:48 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

He should feel fear. The analytical part of his mind recognized this. A rational person, waking in an unknown location with an altered body and memories of their own death, should experience terror. The amygdala should flood the system with cortisol. The sympathetic nervous system should trigger fight-or-flight.

None of that happened.

He felt alert. Curious. Strangely calm.

---

## SCENE 22
**Time:** 14:53:05 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

The bird called again. Hō-hoke-kyo.

He knew that bird. Uguisu. Japanese Bush Warbler. The call was distinctive—he'd heard recordings during his undergraduate linguistics work, studying the acoustic properties of animal vocalizations.

Japanese bird. Japanese flowers. The purple blooms around him were sumire—violets.

He was in Japan.

---

## SCENE 23
**Time:** 14:53:22 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

His clothes were wrong.

Gray slacks, slightly dusty from the field. White button-down shirt, collar open, no tie. Black leather shoes that fit perfectly but showed wear at the toe consistent with regular use. An undershirt beneath the button-down. Cotton, soft, quality material.

Not his clothes. He'd died in a laboratory, wearing protective gear over casual Friday attire. Jeans and a UAF Physics Department t-shirt.

---

## SCENE 24
**Time:** 14:53:39 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

Someone had dressed him.

The thought should have been disturbing. Instead it registered as another data point. Whoever had done this—brought him back, fixed his body, placed him in this field—had also chosen these clothes. Selected them, put them on him, arranged him face-down in the grass like a gift waiting to be opened.

Why?

The question had no answer yet. He filed it away.

---

## SCENE 25
**Time:** 14:53:56 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

He felt something on his left wrist.

A watch. Silver-toned metal case with a white face, numbers in a classic configuration. Brown leather strap, slightly worn, conforming to the shape of his wrist as if he'd worn it for years.

The hands showed 2:47.

No. Wait. The second hand was moving. Had been moving since he woke.

14:53. Almost 2:54 PM.

---

## SCENE 26
**Time:** 14:54:13 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

He read the watch face more carefully. Seiko. Japanese manufacture. The movement was mechanical—he could hear the faint tick if he held his wrist close to his ear, could see the characteristic sweep of the second hand that distinguished mechanical from quartz.

A good watch. Not expensive, not cheap. The kind a man might receive as a gift and wear daily for decades.

Someone had given him this watch. Or given him the memory of being given this watch.

---

## SCENE 27
**Time:** 14:54:30 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

His right rear pocket held weight.

He reached back without looking—muscle memory guiding the motion—and his hand closed around leather. A wallet. Rectangular, bi-fold, the corners softened from use.

He pulled it out and held it in both hands, not yet opening it.

Answers, maybe. Or more questions.

---

## SCENE 28
**Time:** 14:54:47 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet

The leather was brown. Good quality, aged gracefully. A small crease ran along the fold where thousands of openings and closings had worked the material. The edges showed slight wear but no damage.

This wallet had history. Whether that history was real or constructed, he couldn't yet say.

He opened it.

---

## SCENE 29
**Time:** 14:55:04 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

Cash first. His eye went to the thick fold of currency in the bill compartment.

Yen. Ten-thousand yen notes—he counted five of them, fifty thousand yen total. Beneath those, smaller denominations: a few thousand-yen notes, some five-hundreds. Maybe five thousand more in the smaller bills.

Significant money. Enough to live on for weeks if he was careful.

---

## SCENE 30
**Time:** 14:55:21 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

The card slots held plastic and paper.

He pulled out the first card. Laminated, official-looking. Japanese characters across the top, a photograph in the corner, dense text filling most of the surface.

The photograph showed his face.

His new face. The one attached to his new body.

---

## SCENE 31
**Time:** 14:55:38 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

He could read the card. The Japanese came without effort, as natural as English.

外国人登録証明書. Gaikokujin Tōroku Shōmeisho. Alien Registration Certificate.

Name: 月野シェルドン. Tsukino Sheldon.

Nationality: アメリカ合衆国. United States of America.

Date of Birth: 1959年3月15日. March 15, 1959.

Address: 岡山県倉敷市... The rest specified a location he didn't recognize.

---

## SCENE 32
**Time:** 14:55:55 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, processing identity card

Tsukino.

The name rolled through his mind. Not Carter. Not Sheldon Carter, theoretical physicist, born August 21st, 1987 in Griffin, Georgia.

Tsukino Sheldon. Foreign national. Permanent resident of Japan. Born 1959.

He was thirty years old according to this document. Not thirty-seven. Not the age he'd been when he died.

---

## SCENE 33
**Time:** 14:56:12 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, processing identity card

March 15, 1959.

If this document was accurate—if he was in 1989, the most recent date that would make a 1959 birth year produce a living thirty-year-old—then he'd traveled backward in time by thirty-six years.

October 2025 to sometime in 1989.

He'd been born in 1987. In 1989, his original self would be two years old. A toddler in Georgia, learning to walk, forming first memories.

---

## SCENE 34
**Time:** 14:56:29 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, processing identity card

The mathematics of it refused to assemble into anything coherent.

He was dead. He was alive. He was in Japan. He was thirty years old according to a document that said he'd been born before his actual birth. He was Tsukino Sheldon, a name he'd never heard, attached to a face that was and wasn't his.

He set the identity card down on his knee and kept searching the wallet.

---

## SCENE 35
**Time:** 14:56:46 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

Two bankbooks. Slim paper booklets with columns of numbers and official stamps in red.

The first showed an account at a postal savings bank. Balance: substantial. Not wealthy, but comfortable. Years of regular deposits, modest withdrawals.

The second, a local credit union. Smaller balance, more recent activity.

Tsukino Sheldon had a financial history. Years of it.

---

## SCENE 36
**Time:** 14:57:03 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

A folded document, thick paper with official stamps and dense text.

He unfolded it carefully. 戸籍謄本. Koseki tōhon. Family registry excerpt.

The Tsukino family. His family, apparently. Names and dates traced backward through generations. His mother: Tsukino Yuki, 月野由紀. Deceased 1985. His father: Carter James, カーター・ジェームズ. Deceased... the date was obscured by a fold in the paper.

He had parents in this life. Had had parents. Both dead.

---

## SCENE 37
**Time:** 14:57:20 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

An envelope, sealed. His name written on the front in careful brushwork.

シェルドンへ. *To Sheldon.*

The handwriting suggested age—slight tremor in the strokes, the deliberate pace of someone for whom writing required effort. An elderly person. Someone who knew him. Someone who expected him to receive this letter.

He didn't open it. Not yet. The field didn't feel like the right place for whatever message waited inside.

---

## SCENE 38
**Time:** 14:57:37 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

A photograph, edges worn soft from handling.

An elderly man. Japanese features, deep lines around eyes and mouth, white hair cropped short. He wore a plain button-down shirt and sat before what looked like a small shrine or altar. His expression was serious but not unkind.

Uncle, something in him said. The word arrived without context, without supporting memory.

*Uncle.*

---

## SCENE 39
**Time:** 14:57:54 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, examining wallet contents

The last document was larger, folded multiple times to fit in the wallet.

Property deed. Official stamps, survey maps, legal language. An address matching the one on his identification card.

Tsukino Sheldon owned a house. Or would own a house. Or had always owned a house in this constructed history that someone had given him.

The deed showed a transfer of ownership. Recent. Inheritance.

---

## SCENE 40
**Time:** 14:58:11 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, processing documentation

He sat in the grass surrounded by evidence of a life he hadn't lived.

Identity. Finances. Family. Property. Someone had built him an existence—complete, documented, traceable. Not a thin cover story but a full architecture of belonging. Roots extending backward through decades. A place in the world.

Why?

The question remained unanswered. But the answer, he sensed, lay somewhere beyond this field.

---

## SCENE 41
**Time:** 14:58:28 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, sitting upright

He returned everything to the wallet with careful precision. Identity card in its slot. Bankbooks in the bill compartment with the cash. Koseki folded back along its original creases. Letter and photograph tucked safely away. Property deed requiring several tries to refold correctly.

The wallet went back in his right rear pocket.

Whatever this was, whoever he now was, he would need these documents.

---

## SCENE 42
**Time:** 14:58:45 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, checking other pockets

His right front pocket held a handkerchief. White cotton, folded in precise thirds, creases sharp enough to have been ironed.

His grandmother's voice surfaced from memory: *A gentleman carries a handkerchief. You never know when someone will need one.*

Dorothy Mae. Georgia. A kitchen that smelled of biscuits and lemon polish.

The memory was his. Genuinely his. Whatever else had been constructed, Dorothy Mae Carter had been real.

---

## SCENE 43
**Time:** 14:59:02 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, checking other pockets

His left front pocket held coins. He pulled them out and counted.

A hundred-yen coin. Three fifties. Several tens. A handful of ones and fives.

Bus fare. Train fare. Vending machine money. The small currency of daily Japanese life.

Someone had thought of everything.

---

## SCENE 44
**Time:** 14:59:19 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, preparing to stand

The inventory was complete. Watch, wallet, handkerchief, coins. Clothes that fit, shoes that matched, a body that worked better than any body he'd ever inhabited.

He was as ready as he would ever be.

Time to stand.

---

## SCENE 45
**Time:** 14:59:36 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, standing

His legs unfolded beneath him. His core engaged, his balance found itself, his body rose from the ground in one fluid motion.

No stiffness. No protest from joints. No moment of adjustment as blood redistributed.

He stood in the field, and standing was easy.

---

## SCENE 46
**Time:** 14:59:53 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, standing, surveying

The field extended in all directions, but not endlessly.

North: treeline, perhaps two hundred meters away. Cedar and maple, judging by the shapes of the canopy.

South: the land sloped gently downward. Movement in the distance—vehicles on a road, maybe a quarter mile away.

East and West: more field, more purple flowers, the hills rising in the distance.

---

## SCENE 47
**Time:** 15:00:10 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, standing, surveying

He turned slowly, taking in the full panorama.

Mountains. Multiple ranges, layered against the horizon in shades of blue-green and gray. The nearest showed individual trees; the farthest faded to suggestions.

This was not coastal Japan. Not Tokyo, not Osaka. Inland. Rural. The air tasted clean in a way that city air never did.

The bird called again. Still patient. Still marking territory.

---

## SCENE 48
**Time:** 15:00:27 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, standing, decision point

South. The road.

Dorothy Mae's voice again, rising from wherever such voices lived: *Lost and alone? Water, food, shelter. Find people. Don't panic. Think.*

He wasn't panicking. His grandmother would be proud, wherever she was, whenever she was.

He started walking south.

---

## SCENE 49
**Time:** 15:00:44 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, walking south

His legs moved without complaint.

The grass parted before him and closed behind. Purple flowers brushed his ankles, releasing faint scent with each contact. His shoes—black leather, broken in—found purchase on the uneven ground without difficulty.

He walked like someone who had always known how to walk. Like walking was the easiest thing in the world.

It had never been this easy before.

---

## SCENE 50
**Time:** 15:01:01 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, walking south

His stride was longer than he remembered.

The realization came gradually, measured against the ground passing beneath his feet. He was covering distance faster than his usual pace would account for. Either the field was smaller than it looked, or he was taller than he'd been.

Taller.

He looked down at his legs, at the proportion of his body, at the relationship between eye height and horizon.

This body was taller than his old one. Significantly taller.
