# DAY 18 - APRIL 20, 1989 (THURSDAY)
## **Gift Preparation Observed**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

The stranger was building something.

Katsuhito observed from appropriate distance as morning's work revealed the project: a wooden box, small, constructed with joinery that required no nails, no glue. The technique was traditional Japanese puzzle box craft—a skill that took years to master.

The stranger had never made one before. He claimed no woodworking experience beyond what he'd learned in seventeen days on this mountain.

Yet the box was forming correctly. The panels fit. The channels aligned. The mechanism functioned.

---

"A gift for Tenchi," the stranger explained when asked. "The birthday seemed to warrant something made rather than bought."

"The craft is impressive for someone without training."

"The craft arrived when I needed it. As with everything else."

The admission carried the same puzzled quality that characterized all the stranger's self-assessments. He didn't understand his own capabilities any better than Katsuhito did.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

The box progressed through afternoon work. A carving emerged to accompany it—a tanuki figure, the mischievous forest spirit.

"Tenchi enjoys tanuki stories. The trickster who's fundamentally kind."

The observation was accurate. The stranger had noticed, had paid attention, had incorporated that knowledge into his gift.

---

**Day 18 Assessment:**
- Gift creation demonstrates continued capability emergence
- Attention to child's preferences notable
- Appropriate boundary maintenance observed

---

# DAY 19 - APRIL 21, 1989 (FRIDAY)
## **Village Business - Wheel Return**

---

The stranger returned from village with repaired wheel and news of Nishida's availability.

"He can assess next Thursday. Yamada recommended community pricing given the shrine connection."

The integration into village economics continued. The stranger was becoming known.

---

**Day 19 Assessment:**
- Village integration advancing
- Professional consultation arranged
- Gift creation nearing completion

---

# DAY 20 - APRIL 22, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## **Final Preparations**

---

The puzzle box was complete—the finish applied, the mechanism tested, the tanuki fitted perfectly in its hidden compartment.

Katsuhito examined the work. The craftsmanship was genuine, the joinery precise, the design elegant in its simplicity.

"The wood came from Masaru's property. Scrap from the outbuildings."

"The wood continues its service."

---

The birthday eve dinner was simple—energy reserved for tomorrow's celebration.

Nobuyuki's imminent arrival occupied much of Tenchi's attention.

Katsuhito wondered what his son-in-law would make of the mysterious addition to the household.

---

# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## **Tenchi's Fifth Birthday**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

Breakfast: sea bream for luck, red rice for celebration. The meal's quality exceeded even the stranger's established standards.

Nobuyuki arrived at eight. The meeting between son-in-law and stranger required careful observation.

Nobuyuki knew about his own heritage—the diluted Juraian blood that had given him extended life. He didn't know the full truth of Katsuhito's identity, but he sensed more than a normal human would.

What would he sense about the stranger?

---

The handshake between Nobuyuki and Sheldon was brief, evaluative.

"Father says you've been helpful."

"The household welcomed me. I try to contribute."

Neither revealing too much, neither dismissing the other.

---

## MIDDAY - GIFT EXCHANGE (Scenes 101-150)

Nobuyuki's offerings: a construction set, clothes, books. The abundance of parental guilt for absence expressed through material provision.

Katsuhito's contribution: the hero book. The volume that had belonged to his own father. The stories inside held truths Tenchi would need when his heritage awakened.

"This book belonged to my father. Now it belongs to you."

---

Then the stranger's gift. The wrapped package producing puzzlement followed by delight as the mechanism revealed itself.

The child's fingers found the sequence: first panel, second panel, third. The compartment revealed. The tanuki emerged.

"TANUKI!"

The joy was immediate and pure.

---

Katsuhito watched Nobuyuki watching the stranger. The architect's analytical mind processing what he saw: a man who had produced craftsmanship requiring years of training after weeks of residence.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 151-200)

During a quiet moment, Nobuyuki approached Katsuhito.

"Who is he?"

"I don't know."

"You don't know, or you won't say?"

"I don't know. Genuinely."

---

"He appeared three weeks ago. He claims to be a physicist from America who died in an accident. He has no documentation, no explanation for his presence, and skills that manifest without training."

"That's impossible."

"And yet he's here. And the mountain accepted him. And he helps rather than harms."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

Nobuyuki departed with the stranger's mystery added to his concerns.

"He's different. Not dangerous—I don't sense that. But different in ways I can't categorize."

"Nor can I. Seven hundred years of experience, and he's outside all of it."

"That should concern you."

"It does. But concern is not sufficient cause for action. He's been nothing but helpful. Tenchi adores him. The household functions better with his presence than without."

"So you wait."

"I wait. I watch. I learn what I can."

---

**Day 21 Assessment:**
- Birthday celebration successful
- Gift received with genuine delight
- Nobuyuki assessment: suspicious but not hostile
- Stranger's behavior: exemplary throughout

The cave remained sealed. The demon remained dormant. The mystery remained unsolved.

But the household was happy, the child was celebrated, and whatever the stranger was, he had contributed to that happiness.
