## ABOUT TENCHI'S POV

Tenchi is four years old, turning five on April 24th. His POV scenes are shorter (60-100 words typical), reflecting a child's attention span and concrete thinking.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Simple vocabulary
- Present-moment focus
- Physical descriptions ("the tall tree," "the warm blanket")
- Questions as primary mode of engagement
- Emotional immediacy without adult rationalization

# DAY 2 - APRIL 4, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **The Man Who Makes Breakfast**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001 | Waking Up**
The sunlight made patterns on the ceiling. Tenchi watched them move. Yesterday there was a new person. Was he still here?

---

**SCENE 002 | Listening**
Sounds from the kitchen. Not Grandpa sounds—different. The new person was still here. His tummy felt happy. The new person had made good dinner.

---

**SCENE 011-020 | Breakfast Discovery**
The new person stood at the counter. He was tall. Not as tall as Papa, but tall.

"Good morning."

The man's voice was nice. Not too loud, not scary.

"Good morning." Tenchi looked at the food. "What's that?"

"Tamagoyaki. It's like egg but rolled up."

Rolled up eggs? Eggs couldn't roll. But when Tenchi looked, there it was. Yellow and rolled like a tiny sleeping bag.

---

**SCENE 021-040 | Eating**
The rolled egg was good. Really good. Better than Grandpa's eggs, but Tenchi wouldn't say that because it might make Grandpa sad.

"You like it?"

Tenchi nodded, mouth full.

The man smiled. His eyes had little sparkly parts. Silver, like stars in brown sky.

"Your eyes have stars."

The man touched his face, surprised. "Do they?"

"A little bit. It's nice."

---

**SCENE 041-080 | After Breakfast**
School today. Tenchi didn't want to go. He wanted to watch the new person.

"Will you be here when I come back?"

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Promises were important. Mama had promised to stay and then she couldn't. But this promise felt different. The man looked like he meant it.

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 161-200 | Finding the Man**
The shrine looked cleaner. The paths were swept. The man was near the stone lantern, wiping it carefully.

"Hi!"

The man turned. Smiled. "Hi, Tenchi. How was school?"

"Boring. I thought about your eyes instead."

A laugh. Not mean-laugh, nice-laugh. "That's an interesting thing to think about."

"Can I help?"

"There's another cloth. You could wipe the lower parts."

Helping! Tenchi took the cloth. This was important work.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-240 | Dinner**
More good food. Something with fish that tasted like the ocean but nice.

Grandpa said, "This is excellent."

The man said, "Thank you."

Tenchi said, "Can you cook forever?"

Both grown-ups smiled. Tenchi didn't know why it was funny, but he smiled too.

---

**SCENE 271-299 | Sleeping**
The futon was warm. The ceiling patterns were dark now.

And somewhere, the new person was sleeping too. In the guest room.

Tomorrow there would be more rolled eggs.

Tomorrow the man would still be there.

Tenchi closed his eyes and felt happy.

# DAY 3 - APRIL 5, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## **Learning His Name**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

"Good morning, Sheldon-san." The name felt big in his mouth. "Shell-don. That's weird."

"It's American."

"What's American?"

"A country far away. Across the ocean."

The ocean was big. Tenchi had seen it once with Papa. You couldn't see the other side.

"How far?"

"Very, very far. Farther than you can imagine."

Tenchi tried to imagine. His imagining made it seem impossible. "Did you swim?"

---

## EVENING (Scenes 241-270)

After dinner, the man sat on the engawa looking at the sky.

"What are you looking at?"

"The stars."

Tenchi looked too. So many little lights. "Which one is your home?"

The man was quiet. "I don't know anymore."

"That's sad."

"A little. But maybe home is here now."

---

**SCENE 271-299 | Sleeping**
The man didn't know which star was his home. That was very sad. But he said maybe home was here now.

Tenchi decided: he would make sure the man felt like this was home.

Tomorrow he would help more.

---

# DAY 4 (THURSDAY)

The man made fish for breakfast. It was salty and good.

The man showed him how seeds grew. First they were seeds, then they pushed up, then they became plants. Magic but not magic—the man said it was "science."

"What's science?"

"Asking how things work and finding out."

"I like science."

---

# DAY 5 (FRIDAY)

Rain. The mountain made rain sounds all day.

The man fixed something on the engawa. A loose board. He used a hammer, careful and slow.

"Can I try?"

"When you're a bit older. Hammers are heavy."

"How do you know how to do that?"

"I'm not sure. It just... comes to me."

Things that came to people. Like ideas, but in hands.

---

# DAY 6 (SATURDAY)

Weekend. No school! Tenchi followed the man around like a small shadow.

"Grandpa says the shrine is old."

"Very old. That's why we take care of it."

"Old things need more care?"

"Old things have been through more. They deserve attention."

Grandpa was old. The shrine was old. Maybe that's why Tenchi loved them—they had been through things and deserved attention.

---

# DAY 7 (SUNDAY)

Sunday visitors came to the shrine.

After the visitors left, they had onigiri. The man made them. The rice was perfect, the nori crispy, the filling exactly right.

"These are the best onigiri."

"You say that about everything I make."

"Because everything you make is the best."

The man laughed. Tenchi laughed too. The mountain felt happy.
