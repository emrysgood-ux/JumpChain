**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Shrine residence → Tsukino House (work site) → Shrine residence  
**Weather:** Clear, 21°C high, 13°C low, pleasant spring day  
**Sunrise:** 5:36 AM | **Sunset:** 6:35 PM

## SCENE 1: SATURDAY MORNING
**Time:** 05:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Weekends worked differently in villages.

Sheldon woke to the realization that Saturday meant nothing to agricultural communities—crops needed attention regardless of calendar conventions. The shrine operated on its own schedule, Katsuhito's duties following ritual requirements rather than work weeks. Only Tenchi observed the weekend distinction, his kindergarten closed until Monday.

The guest room had acquired small signs of occupation over thirteen days. A notebook on the desk. A photograph propped against the window—Uncle Kiyoshi had sent it with his second letter, showing Sheldon's grandmother as a young woman standing before the house he now repaired. Personal items that transformed temporary housing into something closer to residence.

He rose and dressed, the routine requiring no thought.

## SCENE 2: TENCHI'S SATURDAY
**Time:** 06:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

The boy appeared at breakfast with plans.

"Grandfather said I could help at your house today." Tenchi's face showed excitement that early morning hadn't dimmed. "Not on the roof—that's too dangerous for children. But on the ground. Carrying things. Watching the carpenters work."

"Did you ask, or did Grandfather offer?"

"I asked." The distinction mattered to Tenchi, apparently. "He said if Yamada-san agrees, I can come. But I have to stay out of the way when they're doing complicated things."

Sheldon considered the proposal. A four-year-old at a construction site carried obvious risks—but villages had always integrated children into adult work, teaching through observation and graduated participation. Yamada would set appropriate boundaries.

"Let's ask Yamada-san when we arrive."

## SCENE 3: YAMADA'S ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 08:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

The carpenter examined Tenchi with professional evaluation.

"You want to help." The statement invited neither confirmation nor denial—just observation.

"Yes, Yamada-san."

"Helping requires following instructions exactly. Not approximately. Not creatively. Exactly." Yamada's voice held the same patient firmness he applied to teaching construction techniques. "Can you do that?"

"Yes, Yamada-san."

"We'll see." The carpenter nodded toward a pile of removed tiles, stacked neatly from earlier work. "Those need sorting. Good tiles in this section, damaged tiles in that section. Cracked means damaged. Chipped means damaged. Uncertain means ask."

Tenchi approached the task with visible seriousness.

## SCENE 4: EAST SIDE PROGRESS
**Time:** 10:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

The mortise deepened through careful removal.

Sheldon worked alongside Takeshi, learning chisel techniques that required patience more than strength. Each stroke removed a calculated amount of material—too much risked weakening the surrounding wood; too little prolonged the work without benefit.

"The hands learn through repetition," Takeshi said. "The first thousand chisel strokes teach the motion. The second thousand teach the pressure. The third thousand teach when to stop."

"How many have you made?"

"I stopped counting at ten thousand. By then, counting seemed irrelevant."

Below them, Tenchi's small form moved between tile piles with methodical attention. The boy examined each tile before placing it, taking the sorting task seriously enough that Yamada had offered a slight nod of approval during his periodic observations.

## SCENE 5: LUNCH WITH TENCHI
**Time:** 12:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The boy had earned his lunch.

Tenchi sat beside Sheldon on the repaired engawa section, legs dangling over the edge, eating onigiri with the appetite of someone who had performed meaningful work. The tile sorting had taken most of the morning, and his pile divisions showed consistent judgment.

"Yamada-san said I did well." The observation carried obvious pride. "He said most children would have gotten bored and stopped paying attention."

"Most children might have. You didn't."

"It was important. You can't fix the roof with broken tiles." The logic was simple but sound. "And sorting them helps the workers know which ones to use without checking every time."

"That's exactly right."

Tenchi bit into his rice ball with the satisfaction of someone whose contribution had been recognized and valued.

---

## SCENE 6: AFTERNOON OBSERVATION
**Time:** 14:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

Yamada allowed Tenchi into the house.

The interior work—reinforcing ceiling joists, treating wood against future insect damage—proceeded in spaces where a careful child could observe without interfering. Tenchi watched as the carpenter applied borate solution to exposed beams, the treatment soaking into wood fibers with the patience of water finding its level.

"The termites came through here," Yamada explained, pointing to faint galleries in the beam surface. "The borate will prevent future infestation—it makes the wood taste unpleasant to insects. They'll find other things to eat."

"What if they're really hungry?"

"Then they'll eat something else anyway. Termites aren't stubborn—they follow the path of least resistance. Make this wood the path of most resistance, and they'll choose differently."

The explanation satisfied something in Tenchi's understanding. He nodded slowly, processing the information with visible attention.

## SCENE 7: WALK HOME
**Time:** 17:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and shrine

Tenchi's hand found Sheldon's as they walked.

The gesture came naturally—a child seeking connection after a day spent among adults focused on adult work. Sheldon accepted the small hand without comment, adjusting his pace to match Tenchi's shorter stride.

"Will my house need fixing someday?"

"All houses need fixing eventually. Wood ages, weather damages, things wear out." Sheldon considered how to frame the answer appropriately. "But if you take care of your house, the fixing stays small. Ignore problems, and they become bigger problems."

"Grandfather takes care of our house."

"He does. That's why it's still standing after so many years."

"And you'll take care of your house after Yamada-san fixes it."

"That's the plan."

Tenchi's grip tightened slightly—not fear, but connection. The day's work had created something between them that hadn't existed before.

## SCENE 8: EVENING REPORT
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Katsuhito listened to Tenchi's account of the day.

The boy's description captured details Sheldon had noticed and some he had missed—the particular color of the borate solution, the way Yamada's hands moved differently when explaining versus working, the sound the tiles made when sorted into their proper piles.

"You observed well," Katsuhito said when the account concluded.

"Yamada-san said the same thing. He said observation is the first step in learning any craft."

"Yamada is correct. What do you think the second step is?"

Tenchi considered carefully. "Practice?"

"Close. The second step is deciding what's worth practicing. Observation shows you possibilities. Judgment selects which possibilities matter. Practice develops the ones you've chosen."

The exchange carried the quality of lessons Katsuhito wove into ordinary conversation—philosophy emerging from practical questions, wisdom offered without pedantry.

## SCENE 9: NIGHT
**Time:** 21:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The thirteenth night felt unremarkable.

Sheldon lay on his futon, reviewing the day's progress. The east side mortise nearing completion. Tenchi's successful integration into the work site. The household's rhythm absorbing another Saturday without disruption.

Thirteen days. Nearly two weeks in a life that had begun without warning and continued without explanation. The strangeness had faded into something closer to normalcy—or perhaps his definition of normalcy had expanded to accommodate the strange.

His grandmother's photograph caught the room's dim light from its position by the window. A young woman who had become the elderly woman who had taught him to cook, to persist, to find meaning in small daily tasks. He was living in her childhood village, repairing her sister's house, continuing something she had started when she married an American and carried this family's thread across an ocean.

The presence at the edge of sleep remained quiet tonight.

Sleep came without dreams.
