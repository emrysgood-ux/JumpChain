## CANON CONSTRAINTS

- Has adopted sister Rea
- Father Nobuyuki is ~120 years old (appears ~40)
- Grandfather is ~727 years old (appears ~80)

### What Tenchi Does NOT Know (Age 4-5)
- His grandfather is an alien prince
- His great-great-etc-grandmother is an empress
- His family has Juraian heritage
- A space pirate is sealed beneath the shrine
- He will one day surpass gods in power (Kami Tenchi)

### What Tenchi DOES Know
- Grandpa is "special" (vague child understanding)
- The tree is important and "watches"
- The mountain "knows things"
- His mother is gone (limited memory)
- His father works far away

---

## NARRATIVE FUNCTION

### Primary Roles
- **Emotional catalyst:** His presence softens Sheldon and Katsuhito
- **Innocence anchor:** Grounds cosmic story in human stakes
- **Future protagonist:** Will become central to OVA events (2001)
- **Found family nucleus:** Relationship with Sheldon as "uncle" figure

### Plot Threads Connected
- `thread_tenchi_attachment`: "Sheru-ji" nickname development
- `thread_tenchi_training`: Future training preparation (Year 4+)
- `thread_birthday_day22`: Turns 5, first major celebration
- `thread_found_family`: Sheldon integrates through Tenchi bond

### Seeds Planted (Day 1)
1. **Immediate acceptance** — No stranger-danger, trusts Sheldon
2. **Physical curiosity** — Examines hands, notices differences
3. **Tree awareness** — Already knows to respect Funaho
4. **Beetle obsession** — Seasonal interest, future activity bonding
5. **Need for male presence** — Father absent, gravitates to Sheldon

### Nickname Development (Future)
- Day 1: "Tsukino-san" (formal, grandfather-taught)
- Week 1-2: "Sheldon-san" (learning name)
- Month 1-2: "Sheru-san" (childish shortening)
- Month 3+: "Sheru-ji" (uncle honorific, permanent)

## WRITING NOTES

### Voice Accuracy (Age 4-5)
- Short sentences (5 words average)
- Questions dominate speech
- Topic changes without warning
- Repeats phrases heard from grandfather
- Mixes formal/informal speech
- Announces rather than converses
- High emotional transparency

### Physical Behavior
- Grabs hands without asking
- Runs rather than walks
- Climbs on furniture
- Short attention span (except for interests)
- Needs afternoon rest
- Eats messily but knows table manners

### Emotional Patterns
- Quick to warm up after initial shyness
- Seeks adult approval constantly
- Talks about mother matter-of-factly (too young to fully grieve)
- Attached to grandfather as primary bond
- Excited by new people once comfortable

### Sample Scene Construction

**CORRECT:**
> Tenchi appeared at the doorway, still wearing his kindergarten uniform. Navy shorts, white shirt, the yellow cap clutched in one hand. His eyes found Sheldon immediately.
> 
> "You came back!"
> 
> He crossed the room at a run, stopping just short of collision. His hand found Sheldon's sleeve and tugged.
> 
> "Grandpa said you might stay. Are you staying? I can show you where the beetles are. The big ones. Not now—they come in summer. But I know where."

**INCORRECT:**
> Tenchi greeted Sheldon warmly, expressing his hope that the visitor would remain at the shrine. He offered to show Sheldon the locations where beetles could be found during the summer months.
