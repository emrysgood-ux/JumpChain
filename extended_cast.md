## MASAKI FAMILY - DECEASED

### Kiyone Masaki (Tenchi's Mother)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Kiyone Masaki |
| **Relation** | Tenchi's mother; Yosho + Airi's daughter |
| **Status** | Deceased ~1988 |
| **Age at Death** | 248 years |
| **Cause of Death** | CLASSIFIED - "Cannot be revealed" |

#### Kiyone's Role in Yosho's 700-Year Plan

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q20

Kiyone was NOT merely a passive participant in family life. She actively assisted Yosho's centuries-long strategy:

> "He [Yosho] made Tenchi interested in the demon ever since childhood, with help of Tenchi's mother."

**Key Points:**
- Kiyone ACTIVELY HELPED cultivate Tenchi's curiosity about the cave
- She was a knowing participant in Yosho's plan
- Her involvement was deliberate, not coincidental
- She understood the strategic importance of Tenchi's future role

#### Death Circumstances - Plot Significance

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q31

When asked why Tenchi's mother died:

> "She died because she had a short lifespan? Well, people say 'A beauty would not live long', wouldn't they? (Bijin hakumei is an idiom.) So, just be satisfied with this answer. IT CANNOT BE REVEALED BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PLOT."

**Key Points:**
- The true cause/circumstances of her death are DELIBERATELY WITHHELD
- This information is PLOT-SIGNIFICANT for future story arcs
- The idiom response ("bijin hakumei") is a DEFLECTION, not the real answer
- Kajishima considers this important enough to hide
- The mystery remains in canon

#### Lifespan Without Enhancement

**Source:** Tenchi Fandom Wiki (derived from novels)

Kiyone never received bio-enhancement augmentations and died at the natural extended lifespan inherited from Yosho's genetics:
- **Age at death:** 248 years
- **No bio-enhancement:** Her choice (or circumstances)
- **Natural Juraian-descendant lifespan:** Extended beyond human, but not indefinite

#### Ryoko's Presence at Death

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets (confirmed in various sources)

Ryoko was present (in astral form) when Kiyone died. This is one of the early revealed details about the death scene.

#### Seina's Presence at Death

**Source:** GXP Novels

Seina Yamada (childhood friend of Tenchi, protagonist of GXP) was present when Kiyone died and believes his bad luck killed her.

### Kasumi (Yosho's First Earth Wife)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Kasumi |
| **Relation** | Funaho's niece; Yosho's cousin and wife |
| **Rescue** | During Ryoko battle ~1292 CE |
| **Marriage Duration** | ~100 years |
| **Children** | 3 with Yosho |
| **Age at Death** | 138 years |

#### Kasumi's Complete Story

**Source:** Tenchi Fandom Wiki + 101 Secrets Q29

Kasumi was:
- Empress Funaho's niece (making her Yosho's cousin)
- Rescued by Yosho during the battle with Ryoko on Earth
- His first wife after arriving on Earth

#### The Longevity Decision

> "Kasumi was initially assisted with life extension technology but became disturbed with her extended life, outliving all of her fellow Earthlings, and so she requested for this assistance to be halted and eventually died at the age of 138."

**The Psychology:**
- She watched all her Earth friends age and die
- She saw generations pass while she remained
- The isolation and loss became unbearable
- She chose mortality over eternal watching

**Yosho's Response:**
- He honored her wish without question
- He stopped the longevity treatments
- After her death, he gave subsequent descendants THE CHOICE
- Some chose enhancement, some did not

#### The Three Children

Kasumi had 3 children with Yosho. The Masaki family on Earth descends from these children (among others from Yosho's "several wives").

#### Story Significance

Kasumi's decision establishes:
1. Bio-enhancement is a CHOICE in Masaki family
2. Not all choose extended life
3. The emotional cost of longevity is real
4. Yosho respects individual choice about lifespan
5. This affects how Yosho might view Sheldon's similar situation
