# SCENE 3.1: Third Dawn

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 05:30 - 06:00  
**Location:** Guest room → Kitchen  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,000

The darkness felt familiar now.

Sheldon's eyes opened to the grey line beneath the shutter, and this time there was no moment of disorientation, no heart-pounding confusion about where he was. His body knew the futon's firmness, knew the cedar-and-smoke smell of the room, knew the particular quality of mountain silence that pressed against the walls.

Three days. He had been in this existence for three days, and already his nervous system had begun to accept it as real.

He rose without urgency, pushing back the covers with movements that had shed their novelty. The tatami was cool beneath his feet—it would be cool every morning, he understood now, until summer truly arrived. His clothes hung from the hook where he had placed them. His bag from Haruna's store sat in its corner. The scroll in the alcove advised patience, or endurance, and he was beginning to think it meant both.

The squeaky door announced him as he slid it open, but he had stopped wincing at the sound. It was simply part of the morning's language, the household's way of tracking who moved where. He suspected the shrine had been designed this way deliberately—a priest's home, after all, should know when strangers approached.

The hallway was dim, but light already glowed from the kitchen.

Rea was at the counter when he entered, her hands moving through the familiar motions of breakfast preparation. She glanced up at his arrival, and something in her expression had shifted since that first morning—not warmth, exactly, but an absence of surprise. He belonged to the dawn now.

"Tea?" she asked.

"I'll make it."

She nodded and returned to her work.

The teapot was where it had been yesterday, and the day before. The canister of sencha sat beside it, the kettle already warming on the stove. Sheldon fell into the rhythm without thinking: water to the proper temperature, leaves measured into the pot, timing counted in his head while he watched the color develop.

This was his task now. Small, domestic, unremarkable—and precisely because of that, meaningful. He had been given a place in the household's morning, a role that was his to fill.

The tea steeped. The kitchen filled with familiar sounds. Outside, the first birds began to stir.

Another day in his new life was beginning, and for the first time, that thought carried no weight of strangeness. It simply was.

# SCENE 3.2: Morning Rhythm

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 06:00 - 07:00  
**Location:** Kitchen → Dining area  
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon primary, Rea secondary)

---

The rice cooker clicked, announcing its completion, and Rea moved to check it with the automatic grace of long practice.

Sheldon watched from his position at the counter, where he was slicing pickled radish into thin rounds. She had shown him the technique yesterday—the knife angled just so, the slices uniform enough to be respectable if not expert—and he found a certain satisfaction in the repetition. His hands, at least, were learning faster than his mind could follow.

"The pickles are from last autumn," Rea said, not looking up from the rice. "Michiko-san's barrel. The shrine has been maintaining it since she passed."

"Michiko?" The name was familiar from his documents, from the property records, but he hadn't heard anyone speak it aloud before.

"The woman who lived in your house. Before." Rea's hands paused for just a moment over the rice paddle. "She was kind. She used to bring things to the shrine—vegetables from her garden, pickles she had made. She said the mountain spirits needed feeding too."

There was something in her voice that Sheldon couldn't quite identify. Not grief, exactly—more like the memory of kindness received and carefully preserved.

"Did you know her well?"

"I knew her as a child knows an old woman who gives her sweet things." Rea resumed her work, scooping rice into bowls with measured precision. "She would tell me stories about her family, about the people who had lived in that house before. She said she was the last, but she always smiled when she said it. As if she knew something the rest of us didn't."

Sheldon thought about the photographs he had found in the house—faces he didn't recognize, a family history he had inherited but not lived. Michiko must have known those faces, must have grown up with their stories.

"She had no children?" he asked.

"A son. He died young, in the war. She never married again after her husband passed." Rea set the rice bowls on a tray. "She said the house was waiting for someone. I don't think she meant herself."

The statement hung in the kitchen air, heavy with implication. Sheldon focused on his radish slicing, letting the silence fill with the sound of knife against cutting board.

---

Rea carried the tray toward the dining area, then paused at the doorway.

"Where did you learn to be useful in a kitchen?"

The question surprised him. "My grandmother. She believed everyone should know how to feed themselves and others."

"She sounds practical."

"She was. She raised me after my parents—" He stopped. The sentence had begun automatically, drawing from a well of memory that belonged to his old life. But the words that followed would require invention, would require choosing what version of himself to present.

Rea was watching him with quiet attention.

"After my parents couldn't," he finished. "She taught me that being useful is its own kind of belonging."

Something shifted in Rea's expression—not softening, but recognition. As if she had heard something that resonated with her own experience.

"Kiyone-san said something similar once. That purpose is a kindness we give ourselves."

She turned and continued to the dining area before Sheldon could respond.

He finished slicing the radish and arranged the pieces on a small plate, considering what he had just learned. Rea had been here since Kiyone's death—that much he knew. But the way she spoke of being a child, of knowing Michiko through gifts and stories, suggested she had been here even longer.

And the institution, he remembered. She had mentioned something about not knowing how to receive affection, about learning patterns that didn't match normal families. The pieces were there, scattered across their conversations, but he couldn't yet see how they fit together.

Perhaps that was right. Perhaps some stories needed time to assemble themselves.

---

The dining area was warm with morning light when he entered. Katsuhito had arrived while they worked, taking his customary position at the head of the table. He looked up as Sheldon set down the plate of radishes.

"The pickles look acceptable."

"High praise," Sheldon said.

"It is." There was a glint of humor in the old man's eyes. "Rea does not allow substandard work in her kitchen. That you have not been exiled suggests progress."

From the kitchen doorway, Rea made a sound that might have been agreement or might have been protest. She emerged a moment later with the miso soup, setting bowls before each place with her characteristic efficiency.

The household settled into its morning configuration: Katsuhito at the head, Rea to his right, Sheldon to his left, and an empty space for Tenchi, who had not yet appeared.

"The boy will need waking," Katsuhito said. "He stayed up too late with his drawings."

"I'll go," Rea said, rising.

She passed Sheldon's seat on her way out, and for just a moment, her hand brushed his shoulder—not quite a touch, not quite an accident. Then she was gone, her footsteps soft in the hallway.

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, who was watching him with an expression of mild interest.

"She is warming to you," the old man observed. "That is not common for her."

"Should I be concerned?"

"Only if you intend to betray the trust." The words were light, but something beneath them was not. "Rea has had few people to trust in her life. Losing another would be... difficult."

The warning was clear, wrapped in politeness but unmistakable in its intent. Sheldon met Katsuhito's gaze directly.

"I don't intend to leave," he said. "And I don't intend to betray anyone."

Katsuhito studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded, once, and returned his attention to his tea.

"Good," he said. "Then we understand each other."

From somewhere in the house, Tenchi's voice rose in sleepy protest, followed by Rea's patient response. The morning was proceeding as it should.

# SCENE 3.3: Breakfast with Tenchi

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 07:00 - 07:45  
**Location:** Dining area  
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon primary, Tenchi secondary)  
**Word Target:** 1,500

Tenchi arrived at the table with his hair still damp from Rea's attempts to tame it and his energy already operating at full capacity.

"Uncle Sheldon! Guess what we're doing at school today!"

"Good morning to you too," Sheldon said.

"Good morning." The words were perfunctory, a toll paid to enter the conversation. "We're drawing our families! Sensei said to draw everyone who loves us and everyone we love and that's a lot of people but I have a really big piece of paper."

He climbed onto his cushion with the graceless enthusiasm of a four-year-old, nearly knocking over his juice in the process. Rea caught it without comment, settling it further from his elbow with practiced ease.

"That sounds like an important project," Katsuhito said.

"It IS important. We're going to put them on the wall and everyone's parents will see them at the spring festival." Tenchi picked up his chopsticks, then set them down again, apparently too excited to eat. "I'm going to draw Grandpa and Rea-nee and Daddy and Mommy in heaven with wings and—" He stopped suddenly, looking at Sheldon with an expression of dawning consideration.

"And?" Katsuhito prompted.

"And Uncle Sheldon," Tenchi said firmly. "Because he lives here now. He's family."

The words landed in the quiet dining room with unexpected weight. Sheldon felt something tighten in his chest—not pain, exactly, but something adjacent to it. The simple certainty of a child's declaration, made without hesitation or doubt.

"I've only been here three days," he said carefully.

"So?" Tenchi picked up his chopsticks again, apparently considering the matter settled. "Grandpa said you're staying. That makes you family. That's how it works."

Rea was watching Sheldon with an unreadable expression. Katsuhito's attention remained on his rice, but there was a tension in his stillness that suggested he was listening very carefully.

"Is it?" Sheldon asked.

"Uh-huh. Rea-nee came to live here and now she's family. Daddy goes away to work but he's still family. Mommy is in heaven but she's still family." Tenchi counted these facts on his fingers, then looked up with a frown. "Family is people who belong together. You belong here now. So you're family."

The logic was irrefutable in the way only a child's logic could be. Sheldon found himself without a response.

"Eat your breakfast," Rea said quietly. "Before it gets cold."

Tenchi complied, though his attention remained fixed on Sheldon even as he chewed. After a moment, he swallowed and asked: "Do you want wings in the picture?"

"Wings?"

"Mommy has wings because she's an angel in heaven. But you're not dead, so maybe no wings." He considered this problem with furrowed brow. "Unless you want wings anyway. It's my picture, so I can decide."

"No wings," Sheldon said. "I think I'll stay on the ground."

"Okay. I'll draw you next to Grandpa, because you're both tall."

---

Breakfast proceeded in the way it had begun to establish itself: Tenchi's running commentary providing a constant thread of sound, Katsuhito's occasional dry observations, Rea's quiet efficiency. The food was the same as it had been—rice, miso, fish, pickles—but the familiarity had stopped feeling strange.

"Sensei says families can be any shape," Tenchi announced between bites. "Yuki-chan's family has two grandmothers. Kenji-kun's family has six brothers. My family has a shrine and a big tree and an American uncle."

"I'm not exactly—" Sheldon began.

"You talk like an American," Tenchi said with the absolute certainty of youth. "And you came from America. That makes you American."

There was no arguing with the statement. Sheldon had, technically, come from America—or at least, his documented history said he had. The fact that his actual journey had started somewhere far stranger was not a detail he could share with a four-year-old.

"Fair enough," he said.

"See? Family." Tenchi nodded, satisfied, and returned to his fish.

Katsuhito caught Sheldon's eye across the table. The old man's expression was mild, but there was something in it—amusement, perhaps, or approval. The children's mathematics had declared Sheldon family, and that, it seemed, was that.

"The spring festival is in three weeks," Katsuhito said. "You will want to attend, I think. It would be appropriate."

The implication was clear: if Tenchi was going to display Sheldon as part of his family, Sheldon should be present to be seen. Integration was not a passive process.

"I'll be there," Sheldon said.

"Good." Katsuhito returned to his breakfast. "We will need to discuss your role in the preparations. The shrine has responsibilities during festival time."

Another thread woven into the fabric of this new life. Festival preparations, shrine responsibilities, a child's drawing with his face on the wall. Three days, and already the connections were multiplying faster than he could track them.

Tenchi had finished his rice and was now using his chopsticks to construct a small tower from his pickled vegetables. Rea reached over to stop him before it collapsed, redirecting his attention to his remaining soup.

"Finish eating," she said. "School won't wait."

"School always waits," Tenchi protested. "It's always there when I get there."

"The school waits. Your teacher does not. Finish."

Tenchi sighed dramatically but complied. The morning routine marched forward, indifferent to philosophical objections.

Sheldon finished his own meal, thinking about drawings and festivals and the mathematics of belonging. A child had declared him family, and somehow that felt more real than any document in his wallet.

Perhaps that was how it was supposed to work. Perhaps family wasn't something you proved with paperwork. Perhaps it was something a four-year-old decided with crayons and an oversized piece of paper.

He found, somewhat to his surprise, that he was looking forward to seeing the finished drawing.

# SCENE 3.4: Tenchi Departure

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 07:45 - 08:00  
**Location:** Residence → Steps (top)  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 600

---

Tenchi's departure was a small ceremony in itself.

The yellow hat went on first, settled firmly over hair that had already begun to escape Rea's morning efforts. The school bag followed, its straps adjusted by patient hands. Then the shoes, the final check of pockets for whatever treasures a four-year-old deemed essential, and the rush toward the door.

"Bye bye, Grandpa! Bye, Rea-nee! Bye, Uncle Sheldon!" The words tumbled over each other in his hurry to begin the day.

Sheldon followed him to the top of the steps, watching as the small figure descended with the careless confidence of someone who had made this journey hundreds of times. The yellow hat bobbed through the morning light, visible for a surprisingly long time against the grey-green of the mountain path.

At the first landing, Tenchi turned and waved. The gesture was extravagant, involving his whole arm and probably visible from the village below. Sheldon raised his own hand in response, holding the wave until Tenchi turned back to his descent.

The morning was quiet after he vanished around a bend in the steps. Bird sounds, wind through leaves, the distant possibility of voices from the village below. The shrine occupied its space on the mountain, patient and ancient, waiting for the day to unfold.

Sheldon stood at the top of the 320 steps and looked out over the valley. Somewhere down there, a child was walking to school with plans to draw his family. Somewhere down there, a roofer needed to be contacted about an inherited house. Somewhere down there, a village was beginning its Wednesday, unaware that a man who had died and been remade was watching from above.

Three days. A family drawing. A roof assessment.

The small pieces of a life assembling themselves, one morning at a time.

Katsuhito found him still standing at the top of the steps.

"He makes that journey twice a day," the old man said, coming to stand beside him. "Sometimes running, sometimes dragging his feet, always with too much energy for his small body to contain."

"He's resilient," Sheldon said. "For everything he's been through."

"Children often are. They bend where adults would break." Katsuhito's gaze followed the path downward. "He was not always so. After Kiyone died, he barely spoke for a month. Rea sat with him, night after night, until the silence began to crack."

Another piece of the household's history, offered without prompting. Sheldon filed it away with the others, building a picture of the years he had missed.

"Today," Katsuhito said, turning back toward the residence, "I would like you to go to the village. There is a man named Tanaka—a carpenter, a roofer. Your house needs his attention."

"Rea mentioned him yesterday. She said he's reliable."

"He is. Gruff, but honest in his assessments and fair in his prices. Tell him who you are and what you need. He will understand." Katsuhito paused at the door. "After you return, there is shrine work. And this afternoon, if time permits, we will continue your carving."

The day laid out like a map, tasks and expectations clear. Sheldon appreciated the structure—it gave shape to hours that might otherwise drift toward existential uncertainty.

"How do I find him?"

"Ask anyone in the village. Tanaka is well known. His workshop is near the eastern edge, past the post office." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "You will know it by the smell of sawdust and the sound of complaints."

---

They sat on the engawa for morning tea while Rea cleaned the breakfast dishes. The courtyard spread before them, dappled with leaf-shadow, the great tree rising at its center like an anchor holding the shrine to the earth.

"The spring festival," Katsuhito said, continuing a thought that had apparently been developing since breakfast. "It is the first major event since you arrived. The village will be watching."

"Watching what?"

"You. The American nephew who inherited the Tsukino house. The stranger who has been staying at the shrine." The old man sipped his tea. "Villages have long memories and considerable curiosity. The festival will give them a chance to satisfy both."

Sheldon considered this. He had noticed the attention during his visits to Haruna's store—the careful glances, the too-casual questions. But an event would concentrate that attention, would require him to present himself to the community as a whole.

"Should I be worried?"

"Worried? No. Prepared, perhaps." Katsuhito set down his cup. "You will need appropriate clothing. You will need to know the basic rituals. You will need to demonstrate that you belong here, that your presence is not a disruption but a continuation."

"A continuation of what?"

"Of this." The gesture took in the shrine, the mountain, the village below. "The families here have lived together for generations. They have patterns, expectations, ways of being. A new person must fit themselves into those patterns, or friction develops."

"And if I don't fit?"

Katsuhito's expression was unreadable. "You will fit," he said. "You already do, more than you realize. Tenchi's drawing will be on that wall, and you will be in it. That is not nothing."

The statement carried weight—not just observation but declaration. Katsuhito had decided something, Sheldon realized. Whatever assessment had been underway since his arrival had reached a conclusion.

"Go to the village," the old man said, rising. "Find Tanaka. Begin the work of making that house your home. When you return, we will discuss the festival preparations."

It was a dismissal and an assignment and, beneath both, an acceptance. Sheldon finished his tea and went to prepare for the descent.

# SCENE 3.6: Descent

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 08:30 - 09:00  
**Location:** Shrine steps  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,200

---

The first step was always the one that mattered.

Sheldon stood at the top of the 320 steps and looked down at the path he had climbed twice and would climb again. The morning light fell across the worn stone in long angles, picking out the moss that grew in the cracks, the slight hollow worn by centuries of ascending feet. Below, the mountain forest rose green and patient on either side, a corridor through the trees.

He began the descent.

The rhythm came easier now. His feet found the steps without conscious direction, choosing the smoothest stones, avoiding the places where moisture gathered. His legs moved in the efficient pattern the shrine demanded—not too fast, not too slow, conserving energy for the return.

Twenty steps. Fifty. The shrine buildings disappeared behind him as the path curved, leaving only forest and stone and the distant glimpse of valley below.

This was his third descent. The first had been with Haruna's directions still fresh in his mind, confusion and exhaustion warring in his body. The second had been with the knowledge of what waited at the top—a household, a child, a role to fill. But this third descent felt different. Settled. As if the path had begun to recognize him.

Ridiculous, of course. Paths didn't recognize people. Stone didn't remember feet.

But the shrine remembered. He was increasingly certain of that. Something in the way the great tree's presence pressed against his awareness when he passed it, the way the morning mist seemed to part before him as he walked. The mountain was old, and old things had their own kind of memory.

One hundred steps. One hundred fifty. The forest opened briefly, offering a view of the valley spread below—rice paddies in their neat squares, the cluster of village buildings, the thread of road winding toward distant towns. Somewhere down there, a roofer waited to be found. A house waited to be repaired. A life waited to be built.

He kept walking.

The side path branched off at the two-hundred mark, the shorter route that Katsuhito had mentioned. Sheldon glanced at it as he passed—rougher than the main steps, clearly less traveled—but stayed on the primary path. Today was not for shortcuts.

Two hundred fifty. Three hundred. His thighs burned pleasantly with the descent, muscles adapting to work they hadn't done in his previous life. His previous body had been a scientist's body, shaped by lab work and campus walks and the occasional trip to an underfunded university gym. This body—this new, young, unmarked body—had begun to develop something different. Something capable.

He reached the bottom without ceremony. The steps ended in a small clearing where the path split: left toward the village, right toward a wooden bridge over a stream whose name he didn't yet know. The morning was warm enough that he had begun to sweat, cool enough that the shade felt good on his skin.

Three hundred twenty steps, descended solo. A small accomplishment, trivial in the scope of what his life had once been—particle accelerators and theoretical frameworks and the careful mathematics of the universe's foundations. But today, standing at the bottom of a shrine path in 1989 Japan, it felt like something.

The village was a ten-minute walk. Tanaka was somewhere within it, probably already at work, sawdust gathering on his clothes.

Sheldon turned left and walked toward the future he was building, one step at a time.

# SCENE 3.7: Finding Tanaka

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 09:00 - 10:00  
**Location:** Masaki Village → Tanaka workshop  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 2,000

---

The village in morning light had a different character than it wore in late afternoon.

Sheldon walked the main street with the measured pace of someone who belonged but wasn't in a hurry. People were moving with purpose—shopkeepers opening their fronts, farmers heading to fields, women carrying baskets to the morning market that apparently operated in a clearing near the temple. He received nods of recognition from several faces he didn't quite remember, acknowledgments that suggested he was becoming a known quantity.

"Excuse me," he said to an older man sweeping the sidewalk outside what appeared to be a small hardware store. "I'm looking for Tanaka-san. The carpenter."

The man paused his sweeping and studied Sheldon with the careful attention of someone cataloguing details for later discussion. "You're the Tsukino nephew."

"Yes."

"Workshop's that way." A gesture toward the eastern end of the street. "Past the post office, then left at the shrine—not the Masaki shrine, the smaller one for Inari. You'll hear him before you see him."

"Thank you."

The man nodded and returned to his sweeping, but Sheldon felt eyes on his back as he walked away. The village network was updating itself, he understood. Information flowing through the community like water through channels: the American visited the hardware store area, asked about Tanaka, was polite in his asking.

He followed the directions through streets that were beginning to feel less foreign. Past the post office with its red mailbox and government seal. Past a cluster of houses with gardens visible behind low fences. Past the smaller shrine—a vermillion torii gate marking the entrance to a space barely larger than a closet, a stone fox guardian watching the path.

And then, exactly as promised, he heard it. The rhythmic sound of a plane against wood, the occasional thunk of a mallet, and beneath it all, a low muttering that sounded distinctly like complaints.

The workshop sat at the edge of the built-up area, where the village met the fields. It was a substantial building, open on one side to catch the light, with wood stacked in neat piles and tools hung on walls in arrangements that spoke of long habit. Sawdust covered the floor in drifts, and the smell of cut cedar hung in the air like incense.

The man working at the central bench looked up at Sheldon's approach but didn't stop his planing. He was perhaps fifty, with the weathered face and thick hands of someone who had spent decades working with his body. Grey threaded through his hair, and his work clothes were so covered in wood shavings that their original color was anyone's guess.

"You're the Tsukino boy," he said. Not a question.

"Tanaka-san?"

"Who else would be in Tanaka's workshop?" The plane continued its steady motion. "I wondered when you'd come. The roof won't fix itself."

Sheldon stepped closer, staying out of the path of the wood shavings. "I understand you knew the house. That you're the one to ask about repairs."

"Knew the house. Knew Michiko. Knew her husband before him, back when I was learning this trade from my father." Tanaka set down the plane and straightened, wiping his hands on a rag that seemed to make them less clean rather than more. "Built the workshop shed myself, forty years ago. The roof was my first solo job."

"And now it needs replacing."

"Now it needs attention." The distinction seemed important to him. "I walked past last month. Northeast corner, water damage visible from the outside. Means worse inside. But the main structure is sound. The house was built by people who knew what they were doing."

There was pride in his voice—not for himself, but for the craft, for the tradition of building things properly. Sheldon recognized the tone from his own academic world, from the respect physicists showed for elegant proofs and careful experimentation.

"I need an assessment," Sheldon said. "I'm staying at the shrine while the house is made livable, but I want to begin repairs as soon as possible."

Tanaka's eyes narrowed slightly. "Staying at the shrine. With Katsuhito."

"He offered hospitality."

"He doesn't offer hospitality to just anyone." The roofer studied Sheldon with renewed interest. "The old priest has his own way of measuring people. If he's let you in, you passed some test most don't even know they're taking."

It was a statement that invited response, but Sheldon wasn't sure what response to give. He had noticed Katsuhito's measuring gaze, had felt the weight of assessment in their conversations. But the nature of the test—what it was meant to reveal, what passing it might mean—remained opaque.

"He's been generous," Sheldon said carefully.

Tanaka grunted, apparently satisfied with the evasion. "Tomorrow morning. I'll come look at the house. Early—before it gets too warm to be on a roof. Bring tea."

"I'll be there."

"And don't touch anything until I've seen it. Amateurs poking at water damage make it worse." He picked up his plane again, clearly considering the conversation concluded. "The Tsukino house is one of the oldest in the village. It deserves better than well-meaning destruction."

Sheldon lingered at the workshop's edge for a moment, watching Tanaka return to his work. The plane moved across the wood with hypnotic regularity, each stroke removing a thin curl of cedar. There was something almost meditative about it—the same quality he had noticed in Katsuhito's carving lessons, the same attention to material and motion.

"Tanaka-san," he said. "What kind of person was Michiko?"

The planing paused. "Why do you ask?"

"I inherited her house without ever meeting her. I'd like to know something about who she was."

Tanaka set down his tool again, this time with more care. His expression had shifted, something softer appearing beneath the gruffness.

"She was patient," he said finally. "Patient and kind and tougher than she looked. She outlived her husband by thirty years and her son by forty, and she never complained about either. Just kept living, kept tending her garden, kept feeding anyone who stopped by." He paused. "She used to say the house would outlast her, and she wanted to leave it ready for whoever came next."

"Did she know who that would be?"

"She never said. But the last time I saw her—a month before she passed—she smiled in a way I'd never seen before. Peaceful. Like she'd settled something that had been worrying her." Tanaka picked up his plane. "Make the house worthy of her memory. That's all she would have asked."

He resumed his work, and Sheldon understood the audience was over.

"Tomorrow morning," he said.

"With tea," Tanaka confirmed, not looking up.

Sheldon walked back toward the village center, carrying with him the weight of a woman he had never met and a responsibility he had never expected.

# SCENE 3.8: Village Morning

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 10:00 - 11:00  
**Location:** Village streets, Haruna's store  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,500

---

The village seemed fuller than it had on his previous visits, as if Wednesday morning drew more people to the streets than Monday afternoon. Market day, perhaps, or simply the rhythm of rural commerce—there were patterns here he hadn't yet learned to read.

Sheldon walked without particular destination, letting his feet choose the path while his mind processed the conversation with Tanaka. The roofer's words about Michiko lingered: *peaceful, like she'd settled something*. A woman dying content, leaving her house to a stranger who didn't exist yet. The coincidence felt too precise to be coincidental.

But that way led to questions he wasn't ready to ask. He redirected his attention to the village around him.

The morning market was indeed in operation—a collection of temporary stalls in a cleared space near what appeared to be a Buddhist temple. Vegetables, mostly, their colors vivid against worn wooden tables. Some fish, brought in from the coast on overnight trucks. An old woman selling pickles from jars that looked as old as she was. The commerce was brisk but unhurried, conducted with the familiarity of long practice.

He bought nothing, but he watched. The faces were becoming more distinct with each visit—not just "villagers" but individuals with their own expressions, their own patterns of interaction. The butcher who gestured expansively while talking. The vegetable seller who barely spoke but whose produce was always the freshest. The children running between stalls on errands for their mothers.

A life here would mean knowing these faces, knowing their names and their histories and their gossip. It would mean being known in return.

---

Haruna's store was quiet when he entered, the morning rush apparently elsewhere. The old woman herself was behind the counter, sorting through what appeared to be a delivery of newspapers.

"Tsukino-san." Her greeting carried warmth. "You're out early today."

"Errands," Sheldon said. "I met with Tanaka about the house."

"Ah, good. He'll take care of you. Grumpy as a wet cat, that one, but he does good work." She set down the newspapers and studied him with the keen attention he was beginning to expect from village elders. "You're settling in. I can see it in how you walk."

"How I walk?"

"Less like you're lost. More like you know where you're going, even if you haven't decided where that is yet." She smiled at his expression. "I've watched people come to this village for seventy years. You learn to read them."

Sheldon wasn't sure how to respond to that. He deflected by looking around the store, his eyes settling on a small display of notebooks near the back.

"Do you have journals? Something I could write in?"

"There." Haruna gestured toward the display. "The blue ones are good quality, thick paper. Not fancy, but they hold ink without bleeding."

He selected a blue notebook, medium-sized, its cover plain and sturdy. To it he added a pen—nothing special, just a standard ballpoint—and a packet of ink refills. The tools of documentation, of organizing thought onto paper.

"Starting a diary?" Haruna asked as she totaled his purchases.

"Something like that. I've found that writing helps me think."

"Wise. My husband was the same way. Kept journals his whole life, boxes of them in the back room. I should read them someday, but I think I'm afraid of what I'll find." She wrapped his purchases in brown paper with practiced efficiency. "Letters to a wife who was right there, probably. Men are strange about their feelings."

The insight was offered casually, without expectation of response. Sheldon accepted his package and paid, adding a small surplus that Haruna tried to refuse.

"For the advice," he said.

"What advice did I give?"

"You told me where to find Katsuhito, that first day. You told me people were waiting." He met her eyes. "That was advice, even if you didn't call it that."

Something in her expression softened. "We look after our own here. Even the new ones, if they're willing to be looked after." She tucked the extra coins away with a small nod. "Come back when you need more ink. And tell Rea-chan I have those persimmons she likes, when she has time to come down."

---

The walk back through the village felt different than the walk in. Sheldon carried his notebook and his scheduled appointment and the accumulating weight of community expectations. People nodded as he passed—more of them now, and with less obvious scrutiny. The network was updating: *Tsukino nephew, visited Tanaka, bought supplies at Haruna's, seems to be staying*.

He paused at the base of the shrine steps and looked up at the path that wound through the forest. Three hundred twenty steps, waiting to be climbed. At the top, a household that was slowly becoming his. Beyond that, a future that was still being written.

The notebook in his package felt significant. He hadn't kept a journal in years—the demands of academic life had consumed any impulse toward private reflection. But this new existence was different. It needed documentation, needed the discipline of written thought to give it shape.

Tonight, perhaps. After dinner, after Tenchi's bedtime, he would sit in his room and begin the process of recording what had happened and what was happening and what he hoped might happen next.

For now, though, there were steps to climb.

# SCENE 3.9: Return Ascent

**Time:** 11:00 - 11:30  
**Location:** Steps (ascending)  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 800

---

The ascent was easier than expected.

Sheldon climbed the 320 steps with the notebook in his bag and the morning's conversations in his mind, and somewhere around step one hundred he realized he wasn't counting anymore. His body had found the rhythm without his conscious direction, legs working in the efficient pattern the shrine demanded.

The forest wrapped around him as he climbed—the smell of cedar and pine, the filtered light through spring leaves, the occasional rustle of something small moving through the undergrowth. Birds called warnings of his passage, their songs carrying ahead like heralds announcing his return.

At the two-hundred mark, where the side path branched off, he paused to catch his breath. Not from exhaustion—his breathing was steady, his heart rate reasonable—but to appreciate the moment. Below, the village he was learning. Above, the shrine that was becoming home. Here, in the middle, the mountain itself, older than either.

*Old things have their own kind of memory.*

The thought surfaced unbidden, carrying with it the sensation he had noticed on his descent—the feeling that the mountain was aware of him, that his passages along its paths were being recorded somewhere deeper than stone.

Irrational. He was a physicist, or had been. He knew that mountains were geology, that paths were erosion and human engineering, that the sense of presence was projection from a mind still adjusting to trauma.

But the knowing didn't make the feeling less real.

He finished the climb without incident, emerging from the forest into the shrine's courtyard with only a light sheen of sweat on his forehead. The great tree stood where it always stood, its presence filling the space. Sheldon gave it a slight nod—acknowledgment, if not quite greeting—and walked toward the residence.

Katsuhito was on the engawa when Sheldon arrived, seated in his usual position with a cup of tea cooling beside him. He looked up at Sheldon's approach but didn't speak, letting the silence hold while Sheldon settled onto the wooden planks.

"Tanaka will come tomorrow," Sheldon said. "Early morning. He wants to assess the roof before it gets warm."

"Good. He prefers to work in the cool." Katsuhito lifted his cup but didn't drink. "How did you find him?"

"Gruff. Direct. He seemed to know who I was before I introduced myself."

"The village has been discussing you since you arrived. Tanaka would have heard everything worth hearing within a day." A slight smile. "What else?"

Sheldon considered what to share. "He knew Michiko. Built part of the house himself, years ago. He seemed to take the work personally."

"He takes all his work personally. It is why he is good at it." Katsuhito finally drank from his cup. "What did he tell you about her?"

"That she was patient. That she outlived everyone she loved and never complained. That she was at peace when she died." Sheldon hesitated. "That she seemed to have settled something before the end."

Katsuhito's expression didn't change, but something in his stillness shifted. "He told you that."

"Is it significant?"

"Perhaps." The old man set down his cup. "Michiko was a remarkable woman. Her husband came from old blood—distant connections to families with histories stretching back centuries. She carried that weight alone after he died, keeping the house ready for someone she believed would come."

"Did she know? About me?"

"About you specifically? No. About the possibility of someone like you?" Katsuhito turned to look at the great tree. "She knew things, Michiko. Felt things others didn't. The village called her fanciful, but she was never wrong about the important things."

It was more information than Sheldon had expected, offered more freely than Katsuhito's usual careful revelations. He filed it away with the other pieces—the woman who had known something, left something, prepared something for an arrival she couldn't have predicted.

"The assessment is tomorrow," he said, returning to practical matters. "What should I bring?"

"Tea. Simple refreshment. Tanaka will spend hours examining every beam and tile. He appreciates hospitality that doesn't interrupt his concentration."

"I'll be ready."

Katsuhito nodded, satisfied. "After lunch, there is work. The stone basins need attention, and the lanterns should be checked before festival season."

The day's structure reasserted itself, questions about mysterious inheritances giving way to the concrete demands of shrine maintenance. Sheldon accepted the redirection, though he suspected they would return to Michiko and her knowledge eventually.

Some conversations needed time to complete themselves.

# SCENE 3.11: Lunch

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 12:00 - 13:00  
**Location:** Dining area  
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon/Rea)  
**Word Target:** 1,500

---

Lunch was simpler than breakfast—rice left over from the morning, reheated miso soup, fresh pickles from the barrel that had once belonged to Michiko. Sheldon and Rea ate alone while Katsuhito attended to something at the main shrine.

"He does that sometimes," Rea said, noticing Sheldon's glance toward the door. "Goes to the shrine during midday. I think he prays, though he's never said."

"Does he seem religious to you?"

"I don't know what he believes. He performs the ceremonies, maintains the traditions, but whether he truly believes in the gods..." She shrugged, the gesture surprisingly casual. "He says belief is less important than practice. That the rituals matter whether or not anyone is listening."

It was a philosophy Sheldon could understand. His own relationship with religion had always been complicated—the Baptist grandmother, the academic skepticism, the strange space between them where something like faith might or might not live. The idea of practice mattering independent of belief felt intellectually honest in a way that pure faith or pure skepticism did not.

"What about you?" he asked.

Rea was quiet for a moment, her chopsticks paused over her rice. "I grew up without religion. The institution was... neutral. Clean walls and regular meals and nothing to believe in except the schedule."

The word *institution* again. He waited, sensing she might say more.

"Kiyone-san brought me here when I was twelve. She found me at a placement office in the city, waiting to be assigned somewhere else. She said the shrine needed someone young, someone who could learn its ways." Rea's voice was steady, but something underneath it trembled. "She didn't ask what I believed. She just asked if I wanted to belong somewhere."

"And you said yes."

"I said yes." She resumed eating, but her movements had lost their usual efficiency. "I've been here ever since. Seven years. Longer than I was anywhere before."

Sheldon thought about what he knew of Japanese social systems, about orphanages and foster care and the children who fell through the cracks. Rea had been one of those children—placed, replaced, never quite fitting until Kiyone found her.

"Do you believe now?" he asked. "In anything?"

"I believe in this place." The answer came without hesitation. "In the shrine, in the household, in the people who live here. I believe Katsuhito-sama is wise in ways I don't understand. I believe Tenchi will grow into someone remarkable. I believe..." She hesitated. "I believe Kiyone-san chose well, when she brought me here."

"And what do you believe about me?"

Rea looked at him directly—something she rarely did, preferring oblique glances and peripheral awareness. Her eyes were dark and steady and surprisingly warm.

"I believe you're supposed to be here," she said. "I don't know why, and I don't know how, but I believe it. The house was waiting for you. The household was waiting for you. Even Tenchi was waiting, though he didn't know it."

The words carried weight—not declaration but observation, as if she were reporting facts rather than expressing opinions. Sheldon felt the same strange recognition he had felt when Tanaka spoke of Michiko's peace, when Katsuhito spoke of patterns and continuation.

"How do you know?" he asked.

"I don't know. I feel." She returned her attention to her meal. "Kiyone-san used to say that knowing and feeling were different paths to the same truth. I was never good at knowing. But I feel things truly."

They finished lunch in comfortable silence, the afternoon light streaming through the windows. Somewhere beyond the walls, Katsuhito was praying or not-praying, maintaining traditions whose meaning remained private. Somewhere below, the village was going about its Wednesday business. And here, in this room, two people who had come to the shrine from very different distances were finding common ground.

"Thank you," Sheldon said as Rea rose to clear the dishes. "For telling me."

"Thank you for asking." She paused at the doorway. "Most people don't ask. They assume, or they don't care. You ask."

It was, he understood, high praise from someone who had learned to be careful with her trust.

# SCENE 3.12: Afternoon Shrine Work

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 13:00 - 15:00  
**Location:** Shrine courtyard, grounds  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 2,000

---

The stone basins held water that was older than he was.

Sheldon knelt beside the first basin—a rough-hewn stone vessel positioned near the entrance to the main shrine—and examined it with the careful attention Katsuhito had taught him. Moss grew in the cracks, green and ancient. Leaves floated on the surface, recent arrivals from the great tree. The water itself was clear, fed by a bamboo pipe that drew from some spring higher on the mountain.

"The water represents purification," Katsuhito had explained that morning. "Visitors wash their hands and mouth before approaching the shrine. The basin must be clean, the water clear, the dipper accessible."

Simple instructions, but Sheldon was learning that simple and easy were not the same thing.

He used a small net to remove the floating leaves, then a soft brush to clean the moss from the basin's rim without dislodging it entirely. The moss was part of the aesthetic, Katsuhito had said—but moss that climbed too high became mess rather than beauty. The line between them required judgment.

The work took time. The sun moved across the sky, shadows shifting in the courtyard. Sheldon moved from basin to basin—there were four in total, positioned at key points around the shrine complex—cleaning and checking and occasionally replacing water that had grown stagnant.

Physical work. Meditative work. The kind of labor that occupied the hands while leaving the mind free to wander.

He thought about Rea's words over lunch—*I believe you're supposed to be here*—and about Tanaka's account of Michiko's peace and Katsuhito's oblique references to patterns and continuation. Everyone seemed to believe he belonged, seemed to accept his presence as something inevitable rather than accidental.

But how could they know? How could anyone know?

*Unless someone told them. Unless something prepared them.*

The thought surfaced and he pushed it away. He wasn't ready to pursue it, wasn't ready to ask the questions it implied. The presence that had remade him—whatever it was, wherever it had come from—was not a subject for casual inquiry.

---

The lanterns came next.

The shrine had dozens of them—stone lanterns along the paths, wooden lanterns hanging from the buildings, metal lanterns marking boundaries and sacred spaces. Most were functional, designed to hold candles or oil for evening illumination. Some were purely decorative, their hollow centers empty of everything but shadow.

Katsuhito found him at the third lantern, a stone construction near the boundary marker that warned against approaching the forbidden cave.

"You work carefully," the old man observed.

"I was taught to work carefully. Different context, but the principle transfers."

"What context?"

Sheldon paused his cleaning. "I was a scientist, in my previous life. A physicist. The work required precision—measurements accurate to many decimal places, experiments that failed if a single variable was wrong." He resumed wiping the lantern's interior. "This is different, but the attention is the same."

"A physicist." Katsuhito's tone was thoughtful. "What did you study?"

"Particle physics. The fundamental structure of reality." He smiled slightly at the irony. "I spent my career investigating how the universe was built, and then I died and woke up in a world where the rules seem different."

"Do they?"

The question was simple, but something in it caught Sheldon's attention. He set down his cleaning cloth and turned to face the old man.

"I don't know," he admitted. "I haven't tested them. I'm not sure I want to."

"Because you're afraid of what you might find?"

"Because I'm afraid of what finding it might mean." The truth came easier than expected. "If the rules are different, then everything I knew is wrong. If they're the same, then what happened to me shouldn't be possible. Either answer leads somewhere I'm not ready to go."

Katsuhito was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was gentle.

"Perhaps the rules are neither same nor different. Perhaps they are larger than you knew, and what you understood was only a portion of a greater truth."

"That's a very Zen answer."

"I am a Shinto priest, not a Zen master. But wisdom is not the property of any single tradition." He gestured toward the great tree. "That tree has stood for longer than your science has words for. It follows rules your physics cannot explain. And yet it exists. The universe contains it."

The tree stood where it always stood, its branches moving in a breeze Sheldon couldn't feel. Its presence pressed against his awareness—that sense of attention, of being noticed by something vast and patient.

"What is that tree?" he asked.

"Sacred," Katsuhito said. "That is all I can tell you, for now."

Another deferral, another suggestion that answers would come when he was ready for them. Sheldon accepted it because he had no choice, and because some part of him was relieved to not know yet.

"The lanterns need finishing," he said.

"They do. And after that, Tenchi will return from school. He will want your attention."

The day's structure reasserted itself. Whatever mysteries the tree held, whatever questions the shrine raised, they would wait. There was work to do, and a child to spend time with, and the ordinary extraordinary business of building a life.

Sheldon returned to his cleaning, and the afternoon continued its patient unfolding.

# SCENE 3.13: Tenchi Returns

**POV:** Multi (Sheldon/Tenchi)

The yellow hat appeared at the top of the steps like a signal flag announcing victory.

Tenchi crested the final stair with the triumphant energy of someone who had conquered all obstacles and emerged unscathed. His school bag bounced against his back. His face was flushed with exertion and excitement. In his hands, held with the careful reverence of a holy relic, was a large sheet of paper.

"Uncle Sheldon! Look! Look what I made!"

He crossed the courtyard at something between a run and a controlled fall, skidding to a stop in front of Sheldon with the paper thrust forward. The drawing was visible now—a riot of color, shapes that might have been people or might have been abstract expressions of emotion, all of it radiating the intense focus of a four-year-old's creative vision.

"I drew my family," Tenchi announced. "See?"

Sheldon took the paper carefully, treating it with the solemnity it deserved. The drawing was, objectively, a mess. The figures were roughly proportioned, the colors sometimes escaped their intended boundaries, and the spatial relationships suggested either a family that lived in multiple dimensions or an artist who hadn't yet mastered perspective.

It was also, somehow, beautiful.

"Tell me who everyone is," Sheldon said.

Tenchi pointed eagerly. "That's Grandpa—see his glasses and his stick? And that's Rea-nee, she's wearing the apron because she's always cooking. And that's Daddy—he's taller because he's very tall. And that's Mommy in heaven with the wings and the clouds."

The figure labeled Mommy floated at the top of the page, surrounded by cotton-ball clouds rendered in white crayon against the blue paper. She had a smile—all the figures had smiles—and wings that looked more like arms stretched wide than traditional angel feathers.

"And that's me," Tenchi continued, pointing to a small figure in the center of the cluster. "And that's you!"

The figure representing Sheldon stood next to Katsuhito, both of them taller than the others. The Sheldon-figure had been given dark hair and what appeared to be a confused expression—whether intentional or accidental, it was remarkably accurate.

"You made me look confused," Sheldon observed.

"You ARE confused," Tenchi said with the devastating honesty of youth. "You're always asking questions about everything. That's okay though. Grandpa says questions are good."

---

Rea had emerged from the kitchen to witness the presentation. She stood in the doorway, her expression soft in a way Sheldon rarely saw.

"It's beautiful, Tenchi," she said.

"Sensei said we all have different families," Tenchi reported. "Yuki-chan's family has her mom and her dad and her two grandmas and her dog. Kenji-kun's family has all his brothers. My family has a shrine and a tree and an American uncle."

"The tree is part of your family?" Sheldon asked.

Tenchi looked at him as if he'd asked whether water was wet. "Of course the tree is family. The tree has always been here. It watches us." He paused, considering. "I couldn't draw the tree though. It's too big. Sensei said we only had one paper."

The casual statement about the tree watching them landed somewhere in Sheldon's mind and stayed there. Children noticed things adults learned to ignore. Children hadn't yet built the walls of rationality that kept the inexplicable at bay.

"Maybe you can draw just the tree another time," Sheldon suggested.

"Maybe." Tenchi had already moved on, his attention shifting to the more immediate concern of snacks. "Rea-nee, can I have the crackers? The good ones with the seaweed?"

"After you change out of your school clothes."

"But I'm HUNGRY."

"You're always hungry. Clothes first."

Tenchi accepted this judgment with a dramatic sigh and headed toward his room, the family drawing still clutched in his hand. Sheldon watched him go, thinking about families that included trees and American uncles and mothers in heaven with wings.

"He sees things," Rea said quietly.

"What kind of things?"

"The tree. Other things. Kiyone-san noticed it too, before she—" Rea stopped, her expression closing slightly. "He feels the shrine in a way most people don't. Katsuhito-sama says it's because he's young, that children are more open. But I think it's more than that."

"What do you think it is?"

"I think he belongs here in a way that goes deeper than living." She turned back toward the kitchen. "The crackers are in the cabinet above the rice. You can give them to him when he comes back."

It was a task and a dismissal and, perhaps, a gift—the privilege of being the one who provided snacks, who participated in the small rituals of afternoon comfort. Sheldon accepted all three.

# SCENE 3.14: Play Time

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 15:30 - 16:30  
**Location:** Courtyard  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,500

---

The courtyard transformed under Tenchi's attention.

What had been a serene space of raked gravel and careful landscaping became a battlefield, a city, a kingdom under construction. Tenchi's wooden blocks—Kiyone's blocks, Sheldon reminded himself—emerged from a basket near the engawa and spread across the flat stones with the inevitability of flowing water.

"You have to be the monster," Tenchi said, handing Sheldon a block that was slightly larger than the others. "This is the monster's castle, and the heroes have to defeat him."

"Why am I the monster?"

"Because you're the guest. Guests are always monsters first." The logic was unassailable. "After you're defeated, you can be a hero in the next game."

Sheldon accepted his role with appropriate gravity. The monster's castle—three blocks stacked precariously—was positioned at the courtyard's edge, near the base of the great tree. The heroes—an assortment of smaller blocks with faces drawn on them in faded marker—assembled at the opposite end of the battlefield.

"What does the monster want?" Sheldon asked.

"To eat everyone," Tenchi said, as if this were obvious. "Monsters always want to eat everyone. That's why they're monsters."

"What if this monster is different? What if he's just lonely?"

Tenchi paused in his hero arrangement, considering this possibility. "A lonely monster?"

"Maybe he built his castle to hide in because everyone was afraid of him. Maybe he doesn't want to eat anyone—he just wants someone to talk to."

The concept was clearly new territory. Tenchi sat back on his heels, the block-heroes forgotten, his expression thoughtful.

"But if he's lonely, why is he scary?"

"Maybe being scary is the only way he knows to get attention. Maybe no one taught him how to make friends."

"That's sad." Tenchi looked at the monster's castle with new eyes. "Can the heroes teach him?"

"They could try. But the monster would have to let them. He'd have to stop being scary long enough for them to see that he's lonely."

---

The game evolved from there.

What had begun as a simple battle narrative became something more complex—a story about a monster learning to trust, about heroes discovering that courage meant more than fighting. Tenchi threw himself into the new framework with the passionate commitment children brought to things that mattered.

The monster block was given a name (Grumpy, which Tenchi insisted was perfect because "he has a grumpy face, see?") and a backstory (his parents had been defeated by other heroes long ago, leaving him alone in his castle). The hero blocks negotiated, failed, tried again. One of them—a block with a particularly faded smile—became the diplomat, the one who refused to give up on reaching the monster.

"Mommy was like that," Tenchi said at one point, moving the diplomat block closer to the castle. "She never gave up on people. Even when they were scary."

"She sounds brave."

"She was. She was the bravest." He positioned the block at the castle's base. "Grandpa says being brave isn't about not being scared. It's about being scared and doing the thing anyway."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"He's also old. Maybe you get wise when you're old." Tenchi made the monster block peer over its castle wall. "I think Grumpy is going to let the diplomat in. He's tired of being lonely."

The story concluded with Grumpy emerging from his castle, awkward and uncertain, to meet the heroes who had refused to fight him. It wasn't a victory in the traditional sense—no one had been defeated, no one had been eaten—but Tenchi seemed satisfied with the outcome.

"That was a good game," he said, beginning to gather the blocks back into their basket. "Can we play it again tomorrow?"

"If you want."

"I want. But next time, maybe you can be a hero first." He paused, a block in each hand. "You're good at being the lonely one, but I think you'd be good at teaching too."

The observation carried weight that Tenchi probably didn't intend. Sheldon helped gather the remaining blocks, thinking about monsters and loneliness and the unexpected wisdom of children's games.

# SCENE 3.15: Carving Lesson (Day 2)

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)  
**Time:** 16:30 - 17:30  
**Location:** Engawa  
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon/Katsuhito)  
**Word Target:** 2,000

The knife felt more natural in his hand today.

Sheldon sat on the engawa with the practice wood before him, the late afternoon light falling across his work in long golden stripes. Katsuhito had settled into his teaching position—slightly behind and to the side, close enough to observe but far enough to give space.

"You remember the grip," the old man said.

"Fingers here, thumb here, angle the blade away from the body." Sheldon demonstrated. "Cut toward the wood, not toward yourself."

"Good. Today we begin shaping."

The concept had seemed abstract yesterday, when they focused purely on basic cuts. But now Katsuhito produced a new piece of wood—cedar, soft and fragrant—and turned it in the light.

"Every block of wood contains something," he said. "The carver's task is to find what it contains and help it emerge. This block—" He held it up. "What do you see?"

Sheldon studied the wood. Its grain ran in flowing curves, the color shifting from pale to golden in different sections. A knot marked one corner, dark and dense. He tried to see past the surface to whatever shape might be hidden within.

"I see... potential," he said finally. "I see lines that want to flow in certain directions."

"That is a beginning." Katsuhito handed him the block. "Don't try to impose a shape. Let your hands explore the wood. Let the blade follow where the grain wants to go."

---

The first cuts were tentative, exploratory. Sheldon shaved thin strips from the wood's surface, paying attention to how the grain responded—where it cut cleanly, where it threatened to split, where resistance suggested he was working against its nature.

"You're thinking too much," Katsuhito observed.

"Thinking is what I do."

"Thinking is one thing you do. It is not the only thing, and it is not always the best thing." The old man leaned forward slightly. "When you climb the steps, do you think about each one?"

"I used to. Now I just... climb."

"The same principle applies. Your body knows how to use a knife—it is not so different from using a pen or a fork. Your hands know how to shape—you gesture when you speak, you arrange objects without conscious thought. Trust what your body knows."

Sheldon tried to let go of the analytical framework that had defined his life. It was harder than it sounded. His mind wanted to calculate angles, wanted to predict where the blade would go, wanted to understand before it acted.

But somewhere in the tenth cut or the twentieth, something shifted. His hands began to move with their own logic, responding to the wood's feedback without waiting for his mind to process it. The blade found paths he hadn't consciously chosen, removing material in patterns that emerged rather than being designed.

"Better," Katsuhito said.

"I don't know what I'm making."

"You don't need to know. The wood knows. Your hands know. You simply need to allow them to communicate."

The afternoon light continued its slow progress across the engawa. Tenchi appeared at one point, watching silently before being called away by Rea for some household task. The great tree's shadow crept closer, its presence a constant pressure at the edge of awareness.

When Sheldon finally stopped—more from the fading light than from any sense of completion—the block had transformed. It was no longer a simple rectangular piece of wood. It had become something organic, flowing, with curves that suggested movement and surfaces that caught the light in unexpected ways.

It wasn't anything recognizable. It wasn't a bowl or a figure or any practical object. But it was something, where before there had been nothing.

"What is it?" he asked.

Katsuhito studied the piece for a long moment. "It is the beginning of something. What it becomes will depend on how you continue." He took the carving gently, turning it in the dying light. "Tomorrow, or the day after, we will work on it again. For now, let it rest. Let it tell you what it wants to be."

# SCENE 3.16: Evening Preparation

The kitchen smelled of ginger and soy sauce.

Rea moved through the space with her characteristic efficiency, multiple tasks proceeding simultaneously—rice rinsing in one corner, vegetables being prepared in another, something savory beginning to take shape in the pot on the stove. Sheldon found his position at the counter without asking, reaching for the cutting board that had become his station.

"Daikon," Rea said, sliding the radish toward him. "Thin rounds, like before."

He began cutting, the rhythm familiar now after three days of practice. The knife moved cleanly through the white flesh, producing disks of reasonable uniformity. Not perfect—never perfect—but acceptable.

"Tanaka comes tomorrow," he said.

"I know. Katsuhito-sama mentioned it." She stirred the pot without looking up. "You'll need to be there early. He doesn't wait."

"I'll go at first light. Set up the house before he arrives."

"Tea. He drinks it constantly while he works. Make sure there's enough for several hours." She paused her stirring. "And don't hover. He hates being watched."

"You know him well?"

"I've watched him work. When the residence roof needed repair, three years ago, he spent two days here. Barely spoke except to ask for more tea." A slight smile touched her lips. "By the second day, he was teaching Tenchi the names of his tools. Gruff, but soft with children."

Another piece of information about the household's history, another thread connecting the present to the years Sheldon had missed. He filed it away with the others, building his understanding of this community that was slowly becoming his.

Tenchi appeared in the doorway, his task apparently completed. "Can I help?"

"You can set the table," Rea said.

"I always set the table."

"Because you're good at it."

"I'm good at lots of things." But he went to the cabinet for plates, accepting his role in the household's choreography.

Sheldon watched him—this child who drew families that included trees and American uncles, who saw things others didn't, who carried his mother's death with quiet resilience. There was something about him, some quality that transcended ordinary childhood. Whether it was the heritage Sheldon didn't understand or simply the effect of growing up in this strange, sacred place, Tenchi was becoming someone remarkable.

The kitchen filled with the sounds of preparation—knife against board, spoon against pot, plates being arranged on a table that had held how many thousands of meals before this one. The evening light poured through the windows, golden and warm.

Another day in his new life, drawing to its close.

# SCENE 3.17: Dinner

**Location:** Dining area  
**POV:** Multi (all four)  
**Word Target:** 1,500

Dinner brought them together as it did each evening, the four of them settling into positions that had become customary without ever being assigned.

The meal was simple but satisfying—rice, the ginger-scented pork that had been simmering all afternoon, pickled vegetables from Michiko's barrel, miso soup thick with tofu and seaweed. Tenchi attacked his food with characteristic enthusiasm while the adults ate more slowly, conversation flowing in the comfortable way of people who had begun to know each other's rhythms.

"Tanaka tomorrow," Katsuhito said between bites. "You should bring offerings for the house spirits."

"House spirits?" Sheldon hadn't heard this before.

"The Tsukino house has been standing for many generations. Some believe that old houses develop... awareness. A consciousness of their own." The old man's tone was carefully neutral. "Whether or not such beliefs are accurate, the ritual of asking permission before beginning repairs is considered proper."

"What kind of offerings?"

"Simple things. Rice. Salt. A small cup of sake if you have it." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "The gesture matters more than the substance. You are acknowledging that the house has its own nature, that you wish to work with it rather than against it."

It was the sort of thing that would have seemed absurd in his old life—appeasing the spirits of an inanimate building. But here, in this place where trees watched and mountains remembered, the practice felt less like superstition and more like courtesy.

"I'll bring offerings," Sheldon said.

"Good. Tanaka will expect it. He is... traditional, in that way."

---

Tenchi had been following the conversation with visible interest, his rice forgotten in favor of adult mysteries.

"Does our house have spirits?" he asked.

"The shrine is different," Katsuhito said. "It houses spirits by design. That is its purpose."

"But what about our living house? The place where we sleep?"

"The residence is part of the shrine. The spirits here are aware of it, but it is not separate enough to develop its own nature." He paused, considering his next words carefully. "The Tsukino house stood alone for many years. Such solitude gives buildings time to become themselves."

Tenchi nodded slowly, processing this information with the gravity of a philosopher considering first principles. "So Uncle Sheldon's house is lonely too. Like Grumpy."

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito, who raised an eyebrow at the reference but didn't ask.

"Perhaps," Sheldon said. "And perhaps the repairs will help. Having someone living there again, taking care of it."

"You should tell it you're going to fix it," Tenchi said decisively. "So it knows you're trying to help. Houses probably worry about being broken."

"I'll tell it."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi returned to his dinner, satisfied that the matter had been properly handled. Rea's expression carried something that might have been amusement, and even Katsuhito's usual solemnity had softened slightly.

---

The rest of the meal passed in easier conversation—Tenchi's school adventures, the spring festival preparations, the weather that was slowly warming toward true spring. Sheldon listened and contributed and felt, more strongly than before, the texture of family gathering around him.

Three days. It had only been three days, and already he was planning offerings for house spirits and promising four-year-olds that he would comfort lonely buildings. The scientist he had been would have dismissed it all as anthropomorphic nonsense.

But the scientist he had been was dead, killed in an accident in a universe that apparently had more rules than he'd known. The man who sat at this table, eating rice and pickles with a Shinto priest and an orphan and a child who saw things others couldn't—that man was learning to accept possibilities he'd never considered.

"More rice?" Rea asked.

"Please."

She filled his bowl, the gesture as natural as breathing, and dinner continued toward its quiet conclusion.

The stars emerged slowly, as if reluctant to commit to the night.

Sheldon sat on the engawa with tea cooling in his hands, watching the sky deepen from blue to violet to black. Katsuhito occupied his usual position nearby, similarly silent, both of them content to let the evening speak for itself.

Tenchi played in the courtyard below, his energy somewhat muted by the approaching bedtime. His game was quieter than the afternoon's battle—something involving careful placement of stones in patterns only he understood. The great tree's shadow had merged with the general darkness, but its presence remained distinct, a weight in the air that never quite lifted.

"The village speaks well of you," Katsuhito said eventually.

"They've been kind."

"They have been watchful. Kind comes later, when the watching is done." The old man sipped his tea. "Haruna says you ask good questions. Tanaka says you have the sense to know what you don't know. These are valuable traits, in their view."

"And in yours?"

"I am still watching." There was no sting in the words, only honesty. "You have settled faster than I expected. You work without complaint, you are patient with Tenchi, you treat Rea with respect. These things matter."

"But?"

"But you carry questions you do not ask. You look at things—the tree, the shrine, the cave—and I see you wondering. You have not asked me what you truly want to know."

The observation was uncomfortably accurate. Sheldon had felt the questions building for three days, each strange moment adding to the pile. The tree's awareness. Michiko's knowledge. His own impossible presence in a time and place that shouldn't contain him.

"I'm not sure I'm ready for the answers," he said.

"That is wise. Unwise is asking questions you cannot bear to have answered." Katsuhito set down his cup. "But there are things I can tell you, things that require no great revelation. Would you hear them?"

"Yes."

---

The old man was quiet for a moment, gathering his words.

"This shrine is old. Older than the records claim, older than the village remembers. It has stood here since before the time of written history, though its form has changed many times. Fire and earthquake and the simple passage of years have transformed it, but something essential has persisted."

"The tree," Sheldon said.

"The tree is part of it, yes. The tree is... ancient, in ways that are difficult to explain. It was here before the shrine, and it will be here after. The shrine was built around it, to honor it, to protect it." Katsuhito's voice had taken on a rhythmic quality, as if reciting something half-remembered. "My family has tended this place for generations beyond counting. We have kept the shrine, maintained the tree, preserved the boundaries that separate what should be known from what should remain hidden."

"The cave."

"Yes. The cave is one such boundary." The old man turned to look at Sheldon directly. "You must never go there. Never approach, never investigate, never try to understand what is sealed within. This is not a test or a challenge. It is a warning."

"What's in the cave?"

"Something that should remain asleep. Something dangerous beyond your ability to comprehend." Katsuhito's expression was grave. "I tell you this not to frighten you, but because you have the kind of mind that seeks answers. Some answers are not worth finding."

The warning settled into Sheldon's awareness alongside the other mysteries. A cave with something sleeping inside. A tree that was ancient beyond measure. A family that had kept watch for generations.

"Tenchi," he said. "Does he know?"

"He knows there are places he cannot go. He does not know why, and he does not need to know yet." Katsuhito's voice softened. "He is four years old. Let him have his childhood before the weight of knowledge descends."

Below, Tenchi had finished his stone arrangement and was examining it with satisfaction. Whatever pattern he had created, it seemed to please him. He began dismantling it with the same care he had used in building.

"Why tell me this?" Sheldon asked.

"Because you are staying. Because the village is accepting you. Because Tenchi has drawn you into his family." Katsuhito rose from his seated position. "You cannot be part of this place without understanding that it holds secrets. The specifics can wait, but the awareness cannot."

He moved toward the door that led inside, then paused.

"Tomorrow, make your offerings to the house. Speak to it, as Tenchi suggested. And listen, when you do. Old places often have things to say."

Then he was gone, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the tree and questions that had grown deeper rather than shallower.

# SCENE 3.19: Tenchi's Bedtime

**Date:** April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)

"Another American story," Tenchi said.

He was settled in his futon, surrounded by his army of stuffed animals, his drawing from school pinned to the wall where it could be seen from his pillow. The bedtime routine had proceeded smoothly—teeth brushed, pajamas donned, negotiations for extra time decisively rejected by Rea.

"What kind of story?" Sheldon asked.

"One with animals. And maybe magic. But not too scary."

Sheldon considered his options. His grandmother's repertoire had included dozens of animal stories, most of them with morals attached. But the stories that came to mind first were the ones she'd told differently each time—stories that bent and shifted based on who was listening.

"There was once a fox," he began, "who thought he was the cleverest animal in the whole forest."

Tenchi's eyes were already fixed on him, attention complete.

"This fox was very proud of his cleverness. He could trick the other animals out of their food, convince the birds to do his work, even fool the humans who lived at the forest's edge. Everyone agreed he was the cleverest, and the fox believed it himself."

"What happened?"

"One day, the fox met an old turtle by the river. The turtle was slow and quiet and didn't seem very clever at all. The fox decided to trick him, just to prove that he could."

The story unfolded from memory and invention combined—the fox's elaborate scheme, the turtle's patient responses, the slow revelation that cleverness wasn't the same as wisdom. His grandmother had told it as a story about pride; Sheldon found himself reshaping it into something about patience and the value of seeing deeply rather than quickly.

Tenchi listened with the fierce attention he brought to things that mattered. When the story ended—with the fox realizing that the turtle had understood him better than he'd understood himself—there was a moment of contemplative silence.

"The turtle won," Tenchi said.

"Did he? I'm not sure anyone won."

"He won because he didn't need to win. He just needed to be the turtle." Tenchi pulled his blanket higher. "I want to be like the turtle when I grow up."

"That's a good thing to want."

"Will you tell me another story tomorrow?"

"I'll be here tomorrow."

The answer had become ritual. Tenchi nodded, accepting it, and closed his eyes. Within moments, his breathing had begun to slow toward sleep.

Sheldon sat for a moment longer, watching the small chest rise and fall. The drawing on the wall caught the light from the hallway—Grandpa and Rea-nee and Daddy and Mommy with wings and Uncle Sheldon with his confused expression.

A family. His family now, apparently, drawn in crayon by a four-year-old who saw things others couldn't.

He rose quietly and left the room, leaving Tenchi to his dreams.

# SCENE 3.20: Night

The notebook lay on the low table, its blue cover unmarked, its pages waiting.

Sheldon sat cross-legged before it, the pen from Haruna's store in his hand. The guest room was quiet, the household settling into sleep around him. Through the shutter's gap, the great tree's silhouette was visible against the star-thick sky.

He had intended to write. Had bought the notebook specifically for this purpose—to document, to organize, to impose the discipline of written thought on the chaos of his situation. But now, facing the blank page, the enormity of what needed recording seemed impossible to contain.

*Day 3*, he wrote at the top of the first page. Then stopped.

What followed that heading? A list of events, clinical and detached? An outpouring of emotion, raw and honest? Some combination of both, attempting to capture both the external facts and the internal experience?

He thought about what had happened today. The morning with Rea, her trust slowly opening. Breakfast with Tenchi, the family drawing, the casual declaration that he belonged. The village errand, Tanaka's gruff acceptance, Haruna's knowing smile. The shrine work, the carving lesson, the game about lonely monsters. Katsuhito's evening revelation about the cave and the tree and the secrets this place held.

Three days of integration, compressed into sixteen hours. Three days of becoming someone he hadn't expected to be.

The pen moved before he consciously decided.

*The village is accepting me. The household is accepting me. A four-year-old has drawn me into his family, and an old priest has warned me about caves I must never enter. Tomorrow I will speak to a house and ask its permission to repair its roof.*

*I am a physicist who no longer has physics to practice. I am a dead man who woke up alive. I am Tsukino Sheldon, and I do not know what that means yet, but I am beginning to think it might mean something worth knowing.*

He set down the pen. The words looked small on the page, inadequate to the weight they carried. But they were something. A beginning.

Tomorrow would bring Tanaka and roof assessments and the next step in making the Tsukino house a home. Tomorrow would bring more shrine work, more carving lessons, more of Tenchi's questions and Rea's quiet competence and Katsuhito's careful revelations.

The shape of his life was emerging, one day at a time. He couldn't see the whole picture yet—couldn't know what it would become—but he could feel it forming around him, the outlines growing clearer with each passing hour.

The squeaky door would announce the morning when it came. He set his internal clock accordingly.

Tonight, though, there was only the quiet dark and the watching tree and the first words of a journal that would eventually fill many notebooks.

*Day 3*, the page said. *The beginning of something.*

It was enough for now.
