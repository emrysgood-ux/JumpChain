## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

### Dual Appearance System

Katsuhito maintains an illusion barrier that disguises his true appearance. This is not actual aging—it is a conscious projection.

| **Build** | Deceptively frail | Fit, powerful |
| **Hair Color** | Gray (ponytail) | Dark |
| **Eye Color** | Brown | Brown |
| **Apparent Age** | 80-90 years | ~30 years |
| **Mechanism** | Illusion barrier | Natural state |

### Distinguishing Features

**Disguise Form:**
- Gray hair pulled back in a ponytail
- Round glasses
- Traditional clothing (priest's robes, hakama)
- Slow, deliberate movements (chosen, not necessary)
- Apparent frailty that masks true capability

**True Form (rarely revealed):**
- Appears approximately 30 years old
- Moves with hidden grace when unobserved
- True form reveals in moments of crisis or privacy
- Other Juraians can see through the barrier

### Day 1 Appearance (as encountered by Sheldon)

- Gray hair in ponytail
- Round glasses
- Traditional clothing
- Deliberate, measured movements
- Eyes described as "sharp, alert—younger than the skin that surrounded them"

## PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE

### Core Psychology

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Lie** | "I must carry this burden alone" |
| **The Truth** | "Sharing responsibility strengthens everyone" |
| **Want** | To protect Earth from Juraian discovery |
| **Need** | To let others share his mission; to find companionship after centuries of isolation |
| **Ghost** | Mother Funaho's sacrifice; self-exile from Jurai; sealing Ryoko after her rampage; daughter Kiyone's death; centuries of solitude |
| **Wound** | 700+ years of isolation on Earth, watching loved ones age and die |

### Traits Array

```
traits: ['wise', 'patient', 'cryptic', 'secretly playful', 'protective', 'lonely']
fears: ['Jurai finding Earth', 'failing to prepare Tenchi', 'outliving everyone he loves again']
goals: ['train Tenchi for what is coming', 'maintain shrine and Funaho tree', 'watch over sealed Ryoko', 'protect Earth']
```

### What Sheldon Awakens

After 700 years of solitude, Yosho discovers he hasn't truly lived—only endured. Sheldon's arrival represents the first person in centuries who might understand the weight of his isolation—someone displaced in time, carrying secrets, building a new life from fragments.
