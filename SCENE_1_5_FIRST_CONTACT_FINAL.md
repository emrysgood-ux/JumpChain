### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:45

The old priest had felt him coming for the last half hour.

Not clearly—not the way he could sense Juraian technology or the specific signature of Funaho's prisoner stirring in her sleep. This was subtler. A ripple in the patterns he'd spent seven centuries learning to read. Something had arrived in the valley below, and now that something was climbing his steps.

Katsuhito set down his tea and rose from the engawa where he'd been reading. His joints protested the motion—they always did, part of the disguise he maintained as automatically as breathing—and he let them complain while his mind ran through possibilities.

Not Juraian. He would have recognized that signature instantly. Not Galaxy Police—their energy patterns were distinctive, clinical, unmistakable. Not any of the handful of galactic contacts who knew how to reach him through Lady Seto's network.

Something else entirely.

He walked toward the main courtyard, moving with the careful shuffle of an elderly priest who hadn't been young for decades. Funaho's branches had gone still—not the ordinary stillness of wind dying, but the deliberate stillness of attention. The tree was waiting.

Watching.

The stranger came into view at the top of the steps, and Katsuhito's carefully cultivated composure nearly cracked.

He was silhouetted against the late afternoon light filtering through the cedar grove. Dark skin, short hair, clothes that looked vaguely professional but not quite Japanese. American, perhaps, or African—hard to tell from this distance. He was standing very still, looking at Funaho with an expression that suggested he could feel the tree's attention.

Most humans couldn't.

*Interesting.*

"Good afternoon," Katsuhito called, letting his voice carry the warmth of a priest greeting any visitor. "You've climbed quite a distance. Welcome to Masaki Shrine."

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:46

The old man emerged from between the buildings like he'd been waiting for exactly this moment.

Sheldon watched him approach—white hair, deeply lined face, the traditional robes of a Shinto priest rendered in dark blue and white. His movements were careful, deliberate, the movements of someone whose body had learned to negotiate with age rather than fight it.

But his eyes were sharp. Sharper than they had any right to be.

"Good afternoon," the old man said, his Japanese crisp and welcoming. "You've climbed quite a distance. Welcome to Masaki Shrine."

Sheldon's mouth opened and words came out in Japanese he hadn't consciously summoned. "Thank you, Gūji-sama. I apologize for arriving unannounced."

The title—*gūji*, chief priest—felt right. The formal register of his speech was automatic, the product of years studying in Kyoto, though he couldn't quite remember those years with the clarity he should have. The memories were there, just... distant. Like photographs seen through fog.

"Your Japanese is excellent." The old priest's eyebrows rose slightly. "Kyoto-trained, unless I miss my guess?"

"Yes, Gūji-sama."

"Formal, though. Very formal." The old man's eyes crinkled with what might have been amusement. "We are somewhat less ceremonious here in the countryside. 'Masaki-san' will do. Or 'Katsuhito-san,' if you prefer."

"Masaki-san." Sheldon repeated the name, filing it away. "I am... my name is Tsukino. Sheldon Tsukino."

The name came without hesitation now. Practice was making it feel almost natural.

"Tsukino-san." The priest nodded as if the name confirmed something. "And what brings Tsukino-san to our mountain? We don't see many foreign visitors, and fewer still who climb the steps alone."

---

### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:48

He was watching the stranger carefully now, cataloguing details with the same precision he'd once used to assess opponents in the royal court.

Tsukino Sheldon. The name was half-Japanese, half-something else—American, given the man's features and the particular way he held himself. But his accent was pure Kyoto, the kind of formal Japanese that hadn't been spoken commonly since the Meiji era. Where had a young foreigner learned to speak like a scholar from a century past?

And there was the other thing. The resonance. It wasn't Juraian—Katsuhito would have recognized that immediately—but it wasn't nothing, either. The energy that surrounded this man was... different. Unfamiliar. Like a frequency he'd never heard before, playing just at the edge of perception.

Funaho felt it too. The tree had stopped all movement entirely, her branches held in perfect stillness, as if she were holding her breath.

Waiting to see what he would do.

"I don't entirely know what brings me here," the stranger admitted, and there was something painfully honest in his voice. "I woke in a field below. I cannot explain how I arrived there. I saw this path and I... followed it."

Katsuhito let the silence stretch. Seven hundred years had taught him the value of silence—how people filled it with truths they hadn't meant to share.

"I have identification." Tsukino reached into his pocket. His movements were careful, deliberate, as if he expected to be refused. "Documents. I'm not... I'm not here to cause trouble. I simply don't know where else to go."

He produced a wallet. Japanese. Old leather, worn at the edges. Inside: a driver's license, bank books, what looked like family registration papers. All bearing the name Tsukino Sheldon.

Katsuhito didn't reach for them. Instead, he looked past the documents to the man holding them—the uncertainty in his posture, the careful way he avoided meeting Katsuhito's eyes directly, the slight tremor in his hands that spoke of exhaustion or shock or both.

Seven centuries of watching humans had given him a sense for damaged souls. This one was damaged. But not, he thought, dangerous.

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:51

The old priest was studying him with an attention that should have been uncomfortable.

Instead, Sheldon found it almost comforting. At least someone was paying attention. At least someone was trying to understand, even if understanding was impossible.

"You mentioned documents," Masaki-san said. "A family registration?"

"Yes. A koseki. It says..." Sheldon hesitated, then pushed forward. There was no point in hiding what the documents contained—the priest would see them eventually. "It says I'm from here. That my family had property near this shrine. A house. The Tsukino house."

He watched the old man's face for recognition, for surprise, for anything that would tell him whether the documents were real or some elaborate fabrication. The priest's expression didn't change.

"There is a Tsukino property," Masaki-san said slowly. "On the north side of the compound, through the trees. It's been empty for some years. You're saying you have claim to it?"

"According to these papers, yes." Sheldon looked down at the wallet in his hands. "I don't... I don't remember the house. I don't remember my family here. But the documents say—"

"Documents say many things." The priest's voice was neither kind nor cruel—simply observational. "What do *you* say, Tsukino-san? What do you remember?"

The question cut through everything.

*What do I remember?*

Alaska. The laboratory. The cascade failure. Maria's face through the glass. The quiet acceptance as the light consumed him. And then—

Nothing. Grass. A bird calling three notes in the silence. A body that moved too easily, that didn't hurt where it should have hurt, that seemed to belong to someone he no longer was.

"I remember dying," Sheldon said, and the words were out before he could stop them.

The silence that followed was absolute.

---

### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:53

*I remember dying.*

The words hung in the afternoon air like something physical.

Katsuhito had heard many confessions in seven centuries—had heard humans speak of loss and grief and sins they couldn't carry alone. But he had never heard anyone say those words with such quiet certainty.

The man wasn't lying. Katsuhito could tell when humans lied—the slight shifts in breathing, the micro-expressions they couldn't control, the subtle changes in energy that betrayed deception. Tsukino Sheldon believed what he was saying. He believed he had died, and yet here he stood, breathing, alive, asking for shelter.

Funaho's branches moved. Not with wind—there was no wind—but with something older. Something that felt almost like recognition.

*What are you?* Katsuhito wondered. *What brought you here?*

He did not ask the question aloud. There were some mysteries that revealed themselves in their own time, and pressing too hard would only drive them deeper underground.

Instead, he said only: "That must have been frightening."

The stranger's laugh was broken. "I don't know what it was. I don't know what any of this is."

"And yet you climbed three hundred twenty steps to find out."

"I didn't know there would be steps." A ghost of a smile. "I just... walked."

Katsuhito made a decision. It wasn't based on logic or caution—both of which counseled sending this stranger away, calling the authorities, treating this as someone else's problem. It was based on something older. Something that Funaho's stillness confirmed.

This man belonged here. Katsuhito didn't know why. He didn't know how. But after seven hundred years, he had learned to trust the patterns.

"The Tsukino house needs considerable work," he said. "It hasn't been lived in for years. The roof may leak. The tatami will need replacing."

Tsukino stared at him. "You're... you're saying I can stay?"

"I'm saying that if your documents are genuine, the house is yours by right. And if they aren't..." Katsuhito shrugged. "Well. We'll deal with that when it becomes relevant. For now, you look like a man who could use a meal and a place to rest."

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:55

The kindness was unexpected.

Sheldon had prepared himself for suspicion, for rejection, for the careful bureaucratic walls that modern society put between strangers and belonging. He had not prepared for an old priest looking at him with something that might have been understanding and saying *you look like you could use a meal*.

"I don't want to impose," he heard himself say.

"It's no imposition. We have more space than people, these days." The priest turned, gesturing for Sheldon to follow. "Come. I'll show you around the grounds before we eat. My great-grandson should be home from school soon—he'll be curious about you."

Sheldon fell into step beside him, his legs carrying him forward while his mind tried to catch up with what was happening. The shrine grounds unfolded around them—stone paths, small buildings, the massive tree at the center of everything still watching with its silent attention.

"You live here alone?" he asked.

"Not alone. Tenchi—my great-grandson—lives with me. His father visits on weekends. Architect. Works in Kurashiki." The priest's voice softened slightly. "Good boy. Quiet for his age. He'll be curious about you."

"How old is he?"

"Four. Almost five—his birthday is later this month."

*Tenchi.* The name settled into Sheldon's awareness without triggering any recognition. Just a name. Just a child.

They were walking past the massive tree now—Sheldon could feel its attention tracking him like a beam of light—and toward a path that led deeper into the compound.

"The shrine has been in your family a long time," Sheldon said. It wasn't quite a question.

"A very long time." Something in the priest's tone suggested this was an understatement. "Longer than anyone alive remembers."

"And you're the... gūji? The chief priest?"

"I am the priest. There is only one, so I suppose that makes me chief by default." That slight smile again, the creases around his eyes deepening. "We are not a large shrine. We serve the mountain and the village, and they serve us. It has been this way for generations."

Sheldon nodded, filing the information away. He had a sense that there was more to this place than met the eye—more to this priest, more to this tree, more to this entire mountain. But he also had a sense that pressing for answers would get him nowhere.

Whatever secrets this place held, they would reveal themselves in their own time.

For now, he was being offered shelter. And that, after dying in a laboratory in Alaska and waking in a field in Japan, felt like enough.
