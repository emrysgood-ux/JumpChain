## SOURCE

Perks selected from **Tenchi Muyo! JumpChain Document** by Cosmos as benefactor.

**Budget:** 1000cp (Slice of Life mode)
**Origin:** Drop-In (50cp for first perk)

---

## ACTIVE FROM DAY 1

These perks function immediately upon arrival.

### Drop-In Origin (Free)
- Humanoid form, no extra memories
- Automatic Japanese language
- Can handwave tech/abilities as "from elsewhere"

### Trained in the Old Ways (100cp)
**Slice of Life Version:**
> Knowledge in a field of your choice. Methodology often unexpected, helps see solutions others miss.

**Sheldon's Application:**
- Enhanced intuition in physics/science
- Unconventional problem-solving
- "Sees angles others don't"

### Civilian Savvy (200cp)
**Slice of Life Version:**
> Street-smarts in excess of noble/military/ruling classes. Adapts to new situations quickly. Abduction or aliens = water off your back. Can find work anywhere.

**Sheldon's Application:**
- Rapid adaptation to 1989 Japan
- Social navigation without rank/privilege
- Employment/integration ease
- Unflappable about strangeness

### Exceptional Company (400cp)
**Slice of Life Version:**
> Best of the best gravitate toward you. Most interesting, beautiful, skilled fall into your circle. Those who enjoy your company are enriched—traits and qualities boost, can become permanent.

**Additional Effect:**
> Engaged to at least two noble scions or equivalent. Compatible but may have rivalry.

**Sheldon's Application:**
- Attracts quality people naturally
- Enhances those around him
- The "engaged to nobles" = Yosho connection (eventually)

## LOCKED UNTIL DAY 366

These perks unlock after Cosmos's full revelation.

### The UnChousin One (600cp)
**Slice of Life Version:**
> Greatest luck: being ignored by beings infinitely your greater. Keep head down = accepted as "part of the action." Concealment from prognostics, scrying, higher senses—fuzzier returns the more circumspect you are.

**Sheldon's Application:**
- Divine beings don't notice him easily
- Chousin experiment doesn't flag him
- Can exist in Tenchi universe without cosmic attention
- Washu's investigation = natural curiosity, not compulsion

### Long Lost Last Noble Heir to the Dojo (800cp)
**Slice of Life Version:**
> Inherited credulity-straining number of titles, bloodlines, seats on organizations/councils. Too much to handle immediately, but allies and connections around six powerful enclaves/groups/royal lines.

**Sheldon's Application:**
- Tsukino family holdings (house, legitimacy)
- Future connections to power structures
- Basis for "belongs here" in galactic society
- Details manifest as needed
