# DAY 5 — THE DISCOVERY
## April 7, 1989 (Friday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Main House → Tsukino House (work site) → Main House  
**Weather:** Overcast, 15°C high, 11°C low, humid; rain expected by evening  
**Sunrise:** 5:47 AM | **Sunset:** 6:29 PM

---

## SCENE 1: PRE-DAWN ROUTINE
**Time:** 05:20:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The fifth morning carried the smell of coming rain.

He woke before the uguisu again, his body settling into rhythms this life hadn't taught it. The futon folded itself away with motions that required no thought—five days had converted novelty into habit. His hands knew the creases now.

The work clothes waited where he'd left them: Nobuyuki's old garments, worn soft by years of use before Sheldon inherited them. The faded blue shirt. The reinforced pants. The headband for sweat that would come once labor began.

He dressed in darkness, not bothering with the oil lamp. His eyes had adjusted to this house's particular quality of shadow—the way pre-dawn gray filtered through shoji screens, the shapes of furniture emerging from nothing as minutes passed.

Today the real work began. Yesterday had been preparation: staging materials, clearing the work area, establishing the rhythm of collaboration with Yamada and his nephew Takeshi. Today the tiles came off.

---

## SCENE 2: KITCHEN PREPARATIONS
**Time:** 05:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

Rice from yesterday's batch, cold but edible.

He'd learned to cook larger portions, storing extra in the small icebox Katsuhito had helped him acquire from a family in the village who'd upgraded to electric refrigeration. The technology felt appropriate—ice delivered twice weekly, the rhythm of pre-war Japan persisting in mountain communities where progress arrived decades late.

The onigiri formed easily now. Salt on wet palms, rice compressed into triangles, the portable breakfast of laborers across centuries. Dorothy Mae had called them "rice balls" when he'd described Japanese cuisine during one of their kitchen conversations—conversations that felt simultaneously recent and impossibly distant.

*You always did like working with your hands*, her voice observed from memory. *Even when your head was full of equations.*

He ate standing at the window, watching the sky lighten through clouds that promised afternoon rain. Yamada had predicted this yesterday, reading weather signs Sheldon couldn't yet interpret. They would work until the rain came, then assess.

---

## SCENE 3: WALK TO SHRINE
**Time:** 06:05:17 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

Cherry petals had surrendered to time.

The tunnel of pink and white that had greeted him five days ago now showed mostly green—leaves asserting themselves where blossoms had reigned. A few stragglers clung to branches, but the peak had passed. The path's pale confetti had darkened, decomposing into mulch that would feed next year's display.

*Mono no aware*. The phrase surfaced again, unbidden. The Japanese aesthetic of impermanence, of finding beauty in what passes. His benefactor had planted this knowledge, and he couldn't decide whether to resent the intrusion or appreciate the preparation.

The stream crossing required attention as always. His leather shoes had been replaced by the tabi boots from Katsuhito's provision—split-toe design, flexible soles, better grip on wet stone. Another small adaptation. Another small competence earned.

Smoke rose from the shrine's bathhouse chimney. Katsuhito maintained the old rhythms regardless of who was watching.

---

## SCENE 4: MORNING CHECK-IN
**Time:** 06:18:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

"Rain by three," Katsuhito said without preamble. "Perhaps earlier."

He stood at the engawa's edge, tea cup in hand, watching the same clouds Sheldon had observed from the Tsukino house. His gray hair was already tied back for the day, his casual work clothes suggesting he'd been awake for hours.

"Yamada-san said the same."

"Yamada reads weather better than the radio. His joints predict pressure changes before barometers register them." A slight smile. "Seventy-three years of observation counts for something."

Tenchi appeared in the doorway, already dressed for kindergarten, his small backpack secured. "Sheldon-san! Are you fixing the roof today?"

"The tiles come off today. Yamada-san will show me what's underneath."

"Can I watch?"

"School," Katsuhito said firmly. "The roof will still need repair when you return."

Tenchi's disappointment was brief and philosophical. At four—nearly five—he'd learned that adult decisions rarely bent to childish wishes. "Will you tell me what you find?"

"Everything," Sheldon promised. "Every rotten board and rusty nail."

The boy's grin suggested this was exactly the answer he'd wanted.

---

## SCENE 5: BREAKFAST
**Time:** 06:35:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The meal followed established patterns.

Rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, a small portion of grilled fish. Sheldon had learned not to offer help with preparation—Katsuhito's kitchen operated on rhythms that predated his arrival and would continue after his departure. The guest's role was to receive graciously, to eat completely, to express appropriate gratitude.

Nobuyuki was absent again, having returned to Tokyo two days ago. His work as an architect required presence in the city, though Sheldon sensed the departures carried additional weight—distance from memories, perhaps, or simply the need to maintain a life beyond this mountain.

"Yamada will want to show you everything," Katsuhito said between bites. "He teaches through demonstration. Watch his hands more than his words."

"His hands don't speak Japanese either."

The priest's eyes crinkled. "They speak something older. Pay attention."

---

## SCENE 6: ARRIVAL AT WORK SITE
**Time:** 07:55:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Yamada and Takeshi had arrived before him.

The 73-year-old carpenter stood at the base of the ladder, examining the roof with the particular attention of someone seeing beyond surfaces. His nephew—mid-forties, quiet, built like someone who'd spent decades lifting heavy materials—was already positioning tools on the staging platform they'd constructed yesterday.

"You're late," Yamada said.

Sheldon checked his watch. 7:55. They'd agreed on eight o'clock.

"Preparation began at seven. A worker arrives when preparation begins, not when labor starts." The old man's tone carried instruction rather than criticism. "Tomorrow, seven o'clock."

"Yes, Yamada-san."

"Good. Now—" He gestured toward the ladder. "Today you learn what your house has been hiding."

---

## SCENE 7: THE FIRST TILES
**Time:** 08:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

The roof felt different with purpose.

Two days ago, during the inspection, Sheldon had climbed to observe. Today he climbed to work. The distinction manifested in his body's relationship to the surface—no longer a visitor assessing damage, but a participant in repair. His hands found holds Yamada indicated. His feet settled into positions the old carpenter approved.

"Here." Yamada pointed to a section near the northwest corner, where the damage had been most visible from below. "We begin where the water entered."

The tiles were *kawara*—curved clay pieces that interlocked in overlapping rows, the traditional roofing of Japanese homes for centuries. Each weighed two to three kilograms. Hundreds covered this roof, layer upon layer of fired earth protecting the wood beneath.

"Watch." Yamada's weathered hands demonstrated the removal technique—lifting from the bottom edge, breaking the clay adhesive's grip without cracking the tile itself. Salvageable tiles would be cleaned and reinstalled. Damaged ones would be replaced.

The first tile came free with a sound like dried mud separating from stone.

---

## SCENE 8: BENEATH THE SURFACE
**Time:** 08:32:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

What waited beneath the tiles was not what the inspection had suggested.

The *tsuchi-buki* underlayment—the clay-and-mud layer that cushioned tiles against the sheathing—had degraded beyond simple repair. Where it should have been firm and intact, supporting the tiles above, it crumbled at touch. Sections had liquefied during past rains, then dried into powder that offered no structural value.

"Worse than I hoped," Yamada said. His voice carried no surprise—he'd suspected this possibility—but the confirmation drew his expression into harder lines. "The water has been traveling."

"Traveling?"

"Down. Sideways. Finding paths." He brushed away crumbled clay to expose the cedar bark layer beneath. The bark, too, had rotted in places—dark stains marking where moisture had lingered, where decay had taken hold. "Three years is long enough for water to explore."

Takeshi had stopped work, watching his uncle's assessment. The younger man's silence suggested he recognized something Sheldon didn't yet understand.

"We continue," Yamada said. "More tiles. More truth."

---

## SCENE 9: THE PATTERN EMERGES
**Time:** 09:15:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

By mid-morning, the pattern was clear.

The initial damage point—a section where tiles had cracked years ago, perhaps from a fallen branch or accumulated snow—had allowed water entry. But water, as Yamada explained, does not stay where it enters. It follows gravity, capillary action, the grain of wood. It spreads.

Fifteen tiles removed revealed rot extending far beyond the visible leak. Twenty tiles showed the spread continuing. Thirty tiles, and Yamada called a halt.

"Enough," he said. "I need to see the structure."

He produced a small awl from his tool belt—a pointed metal instrument, wooden handle worn smooth by decades of use. This was the tool Sheldon had watched him use during the crawlspace inspection, probing beams for hidden weakness.

The first rafter he tested accepted the awl's point with resistance. Solid wood, perhaps weakened but not compromised.

The second rafter offered less resistance.

The third let the awl sink to its handle with almost no pressure at all.

---

## SCENE 10: THE ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 09:28:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

"Stop." Yamada's voice cut through the morning with absolute authority. "Everyone off the roof. Now."

Sheldon had learned enough in four days to recognize when questions were appropriate and when obedience was required. This was obedience. He followed Takeshi down the ladder, his mind cataloging the implications of what he'd witnessed.

The awl sinking into wood that should have resisted. The ease of penetration suggesting not surface damage but internal collapse. The carpenter's face—controlled, but carrying information his words hadn't yet delivered.

They gathered at the base of the ladder. Yamada descended last, moving with careful deliberation, testing each rung as if the ladder itself might have become untrustworthy.

"How bad?" Sheldon asked.

Yamada didn't answer immediately. He walked to the staging platform, retrieved a small hammer, returned to the house's exterior wall. Without explanation, he began tapping—working along the wooden siding, listening to sounds Sheldon couldn't interpret.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Solid. Solid. Hollow.

---

## SCENE 11: THE DIAGNOSIS
**Time:** 09:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

They sat on the engawa, the three of them, looking at the house that had revealed its secrets.

"The water damage is extensive," Yamada began. "Worse than the crawlspace showed. The entry point we identified was not the first—it was the most recent. Older paths, older damage, hidden behind what appeared sound."

He paused, organizing information that Sheldon suspected would be difficult to hear.

"The rafters. At least four have lost significant strength. The wood feels solid from below because the outer shell remains—but inside, the structure has been consumed. Rot, certainly. And—" Another pause. "Termites."

The word landed with weight Sheldon was beginning to understand. He'd read about termite damage in Japanese construction during his first days of research. The *ie-shiroari*—Formosan termites—could hollow structural members completely while leaving exterior surfaces intact.

"How extensive?"

"I cannot know without removing more of the roof. But the pattern suggests—" Yamada's hands moved, sketching invisible damage paths in the air. "The water created conditions the termites exploited. They followed moisture into the structure. By now, they may have reached load-bearing elements we haven't examined."

Takeshi spoke for the first time that morning. "The ridge beam?"

"Possibly. I heard hollow sounds near the northwest wall plate. The joints are suspect."

---

## SCENE 12: THE VERDICT
**Time:** 10:02:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

"What does this mean for the repair?" Sheldon asked.

Yamada's expression carried the weight of fifty years' experience delivering difficult news. "It means this is no longer a repair. It is a rehabilitation. The scope has changed by a factor of three—perhaps four."

"The timeline?"

"Six weeks minimum. Possibly eight. We must expose the entire roof structure, assess every member, replace what cannot be saved." He met Sheldon's eyes directly. "And you cannot stay here while this work proceeds."

"I understand the inconvenience—"

"This is not inconvenience." The old carpenter's voice hardened. "This is safety. The structure is compromised in ways we do not yet fully understand. When we begin removing damaged members, we will be changing load paths. The building will shift. Temporary supports will bear weight they were not designed to carry." 

He stood, walked to the corner post, placed his palm against the wood with something approaching reverence—or apology.

"Yesterday, this house was stable. Not safe, but stable. The damage had reached equilibrium. Today, we have disturbed that equilibrium. Tomorrow, we will disturb it further. Until the work is complete, no one sleeps under this roof."

---

## SCENE 13: THE OBJECTION
**Time:** 10:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

"I could stay in an unaffected section—"

"There is no unaffected section." Yamada's patience remained, but his certainty was absolute. "Water and termites do not respect the boundaries humans draw. The bedroom you have been sleeping in shares structural members with the damaged zone. The kitchen shares wall plates. Even the toilet addition—" He shook his head. "Connections run throughout."

"Surely with proper precautions—"

"Tsukino-san." The formality of address carried its own message. "In fifty-three years of carpentry, I have seen two buildings collapse during repair. Both times, the owners insisted on remaining. Both times, they believed precautions would protect them." His voice dropped. "I will not add your house to that number."

Takeshi nodded slowly. Agreement, or perhaps simply recognition of an argument his uncle had made many times before.

"My professional reputation—my family's name—depends on the safety of structures I work on. If I allow you to remain and something happens, I could not face your priest. I could not face my ancestors." The words carried cultural weight Sheldon was learning to recognize. "This is not negotiable."

---

## SCENE 14: ACCEPTANCE
**Time:** 10:25:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The rain Katsuhito had predicted arrived early—first as scattered drops, then as steady precipitation that would complicate the day's work. Yamada directed Takeshi to cover the exposed roof section with blue tarps, the polyethylene sheets they'd staged for exactly this possibility.

Sheldon watched them work, processing implications.

Six to eight weeks without his house. The inheritance that had anchored his new identity would become, temporarily, a construction site. He would need to find somewhere else to stay—and in a village where he knew only the shrine's inhabitants and the carpenter currently telling him his home was uninhabitable, the options were limited.

"Katsuhito-sama will host you," Yamada said, reading the trajectory of Sheldon's thoughts. "The shrine has guest accommodations. I spoke with him yesterday, when I first suspected this possibility."

"You knew this might happen?"

"I hoped it would not. But the signs were present—the foundation settling, the water stains visible from the crawlspace, the age of the structure without recent maintenance." He secured a tarp corner as rain intensified. "An experienced carpenter prepares for what might be found, not just what has been seen."

---

## SCENE 15: THE WALK TO THE SHRINE
**Time:** 11:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

Rain fell steadily through the canopy of cherry leaves.

Sheldon walked alone, having gathered the few possessions he'd accumulated: the work clothes, his original field attire now cleaned and folded, the documents from his wallet, the bankbooks that represented a financial identity he still didn't fully understand. Everything fit in the small bag Katsuhito had provided on his second day.

Five days of habitation reduced to a single bag. The house he'd begun to think of as *home* reduced to a construction project. The independence he'd started to build reduced to guest status once again.

*Self-pity*, Dorothy Mae's voice observed, *never fixed a leaky roof*.

He smiled despite the rain. She was right, of course. She usually was. The house would be repaired—properly this time, the hidden damage exposed and corrected rather than allowed to continue its slow destruction. When he returned, he would return to something stronger than what he'd inherited.

Six to eight weeks. Time enough to deepen relationships he'd only begun to form. Time enough to learn what life at the shrine actually involved. Time enough, perhaps, to understand why his benefactor had placed him here, in this family, on this mountain.

The shrine's stone steps appeared through the rain. Three hundred twenty of them, a number he'd counted on his first day and remembered every day since.

He began to climb.

---

## SCENE 16: ARRIVAL AT THE SHRINE
**Time:** 12:08:17 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, main gate

Katsuhito waited at the top of the steps.

Not at the gate itself, but just inside, sheltered from rain by the shrine's broad eaves. His position suggested he'd been watching for Sheldon's approach—though with a priest this observant, assumption was always uncertain.

"Yamada called," he said simply. "Worse than expected?"

"Termites. Structural rot. Six to eight weeks of work."

"Ah." The single syllable contained acknowledgment, understanding, and something that might have been anticipation. "Then you'll stay here."

"I don't want to impose—"

"Imposition requires unwillingness. I invited you to stay when you first arrived. The invitation remains open." Katsuhito stepped aside, gesturing toward the shrine grounds. "Come. Your room is prepared."

"My room?"

"The guest quarters. Where you stayed your first night, before you insisted on sleeping in a house that was trying to warn you of its condition." A slight smile softened the observation. "Houses speak to those who listen. Yours has been speaking for three years. Now, finally, someone is listening."

---

## SCENE 17: THE GUEST QUARTERS
**Time:** 12:22:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The room was as he remembered it from his first night—six tatami mats, a low table, a window overlooking the shrine's inner courtyard. The futon was already laid out, suggesting Katsuhito had anticipated this outcome before Yamada's phone call confirmed it.

"This will be your space for the duration of repairs," Katsuhito said. "You are welcome throughout the residence, of course, but this room is yours. Your privacy, your retreat, your place to be alone when company becomes too much."

Sheldon set his bag in the corner. The room felt simultaneously familiar and strange—he'd slept here once, five nights ago, before circumstances had seemed to offer alternatives. Now those alternatives had proven illusory.

"The household routine," Katsuhito continued. "Breakfast at seven, dinner at six. The bath is available in the evening, guest first by custom, though you may find Tenchi attempting to negotiate earlier access. Lunch is informal—prepare what you need from the kitchen, or join me if I'm eating."

"And my duties?"

"Your duty is to repair your house. Everything else is optional." He paused at the doorway. "Though if you wished to help with shrine maintenance, I would not refuse. An extra pair of hands is always welcome."

---

## SCENE 18: AFTERNOON ORIENTATION
**Time:** 14:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Rain continued through the afternoon, precluding any return to the work site.

Katsuhito used the time to explain household logistics: where supplies were stored, how the gas stove operated, which electrical outlets were reliable and which were not. The shrine residence, like the Tsukino house, mixed traditional construction with modern conveniences—a negotiation between preservation and practicality that characterized rural Japanese life.

"The phone is here," he said, indicating the device mounted on the wall near the kitchen. "Yamada will call with updates. Your uncle may call if he has questions about your situation—I've taken the liberty of informing him of the change in circumstances."

"You contacted Uncle Kiyoshi?"

"He should know where you are. Family concerns itself with such matters." A pause. "He was not surprised. He said the house had needed repair for years, and that your great-aunt had been too proud to admit she couldn't manage it alone."

Another piece of Etsuko's story, filtered through family perspective. The proud woman who'd maintained a failing house through stubbornness, who'd prepared for an heir she never met, who'd died before seeing whether her preparations would bear fruit.

"What else did he say?"

"That you should call him when you're settled. He has questions about your plans."

---

## SCENE 19: TENCHI'S RETURN
**Time:** 15:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The kindergarten bus delivered Tenchi through the rain.

Sheldon heard him before seeing him—small feet running on the stone path, voice calling greetings to the bus driver, the particular energy of a four-year-old returning home after hours of enforced patience. The shrine's front gate opened and closed. Footsteps approached the residence.

"Sheldon-san!" Tenchi burst onto the engawa, shedding his rain jacket in a motion that scattered water across the wooden floor. "Grandfather said you're staying with us now!"

"For a while. My house needs more repair than we thought."

"How much more?"

"A lot more. The wood inside is damaged. Termites and rot."

Tenchi's eyes widened with interest rather than concern. "Termites eat wood, right? Did you see them?"

"Not yet. But Yamada-san found evidence they've been there." Sheldon found himself smiling at the boy's enthusiasm for destruction. "Tomorrow, if the rain stops, maybe I can show you what we found."

"Really?"

"If your grandfather approves."

Tenchi turned immediately, already running toward the interior of the house. "Grandfather! Sheldon-san says—"

His voice faded into the residence. Katsuhito's measured response was inaudible, but Sheldon could imagine its content: patience, conditions, the measured dispensation of permission that characterized the priest's approach to his grandson's requests.

---

## SCENE 20: DINNER PREPARATION
**Time:** 17:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"You may help," Katsuhito said.

It was the first time the invitation had been extended. On previous evenings, Sheldon's offers had been politely declined—guest status exempting him from household labor. But tonight, apparently, the categories had shifted.

"What can I do?"

"Vegetables." Katsuhito indicated a basket of produce: daikon, carrots, a bundle of green onions, something leafy Sheldon didn't recognize. "Wash, peel, cut. The knife is sharp—respect it."

The knife was more than sharp. It was a *hocho*—a traditional Japanese kitchen knife, single-beveled, the kind that required technique he didn't possess. His first cuts were clumsy, the blade pulling to one side in ways his American knife experience hadn't prepared him for.

"Turn your wrist," Katsuhito observed. "Let the blade's weight do the work. You're fighting it."

Adjustments. Attempts. Gradual improvement. The carrots became coins became matchsticks became something approaching the julienne Katsuhito had demonstrated. The daikon suffered more, but eventually yielded to persistence.

"Better," the priest said. "You learn quickly."

"I've always worked well with my hands."

"So I've noticed. Yamada mentioned it—how you watched his demonstrations, how your body remembered what your mind had just learned." A pause. "That kind of learning has a name in Japanese. *Karada de oboeru*. To learn with the body. It's rare in people who spend their lives thinking."

---

## SCENE 21: THE FIRST DINNER
**Time:** 18:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Three places at the low table. Sheldon, Katsuhito, Tenchi.

The meal was simple: rice, miso soup with the vegetables Sheldon had helped prepare, grilled fish, pickled daikon. Nothing elaborate, but sufficient—food as fuel, as communion, as the daily ritual that bound households together.

Tenchi dominated the conversation with questions about kindergarten, about his classmates, about a disagreement over whose turn it was to feed the class rabbit. Katsuhito listened with patience that suggested he'd heard similar reports hundreds of times, responding with questions that guided the boy toward his own conclusions.

Sheldon ate and observed. This was what family looked like in this timeline—not the nuclear arrangement he'd grown up with, but an extended structure of grandfather and grandchild, with the middle generation absent or departed. Nobuyuki in Tokyo, working. Kiyone... somewhere he didn't yet understand, mentioned only in past tense.

"You're quiet," Katsuhito observed.

"Thinking."

"About?"

"How things work here. The patterns." Sheldon gestured at the table, the food, the room. "In my previous—in America, meals were functional. Here they seem to be something else."

"What else?"

"Practice. For being together."

Katsuhito's nod carried approval. "That's precisely what they are."

---

## SCENE 22: EVENING CONVERSATION
**Time:** 19:45:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Tenchi had been sent to bed after a bath that involved more splashing than washing. The rain had stopped, leaving the evening cool and damp, the air carrying scents of wet earth and cedar.

Sheldon sat on the engawa with Katsuhito, watching stars emerge through breaking clouds. The priest had produced tea—green, unsweetened, served in cups that were older than Sheldon felt. They drank in comfortable silence.

"You're wondering why I invited you to stay," Katsuhito said eventually.

"The thought had occurred to me."

"You could have found other accommodation. The village has rooms available, occasionally. The town below would have inns." He sipped his tea. "But I invited you here, to this specific place, before you even knew your house would fail."

"Why?"

"Because you belong here." The priest's voice carried certainty without aggression. "I don't know why, or how, or what it means. But from the moment you arrived, I knew you belonged on this mountain, in this family's orbit. Call it intuition. Call it the mountain's will. Call it an old man's fancy."

"That's not a rational answer."

"No. It's not." Katsuhito smiled. "And yet here you are, drinking my tea, preparing to sleep under my roof for the next two months. Rationality seems to have accommodated itself to circumstance."

---

## SCENE 23: THE PHONE CALL
**Time:** 20:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, hallway

Uncle Kiyoshi's voice crackled through the phone line—long distance from Osaka, the connection carrying the particular static of rural exchange equipment.

"The priest says you're staying at the shrine while the house is repaired."

"That's right. The damage was worse than expected."

"It always is, with old houses. Etsuko-san should have addressed it years ago, but—" A pause, weighted with family history Sheldon didn't fully know. "She was proud. Too proud to admit she needed help."

"What was she like?"

"Strong. Stubborn. Convinced she knew better than everyone else." The words could have been criticism, but Kiyoshi's tone suggested admiration. "She raised her younger brother after their parents died—your grandfather, my father. Kept the family together through the war, through the occupation, through everything that came after. That house was her life."

"And now it's mine."

"Yes." Kiyoshi's voice softened. "She would have liked you, I think. Another stubborn one, willing to work rather than walk away."

"I haven't done much yet."

"You're there. That's more than anyone else offered." A longer pause. "The priest—Katsuhito-san—he speaks well of you. Says you're learning quickly, fitting in. That matters, in a village like that. Outsiders don't always manage."

"I'm trying."

"Keep trying. And call me when the repairs are further along. I want to know what they find."

---

## SCENE 24: PREPARING FOR SLEEP
**Time:** 21:15:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The futon in the guest room felt different from the one at the Tsukino house.

Not the futon itself—cotton batting on tatami, the same basic construction—but the context surrounding it. Different walls. Different ceiling. Different sounds filtering through different windows. The shrine's nighttime acoustic signature was distinct from the village house's: more forest, less road; more wind in higher trees, less domestic activity from neighbors.

He lay in darkness, cataloging the transition.

Five days at the Tsukino house. Five nights of beginning to think of it as home. Now six to eight weeks here, in a room that belonged to him only temporarily, in a household that had absorbed him through circumstance rather than choice.

*Circumstance*, he thought, *or design?*

The question had no answer. His benefactor—whatever name that entity deserved—had placed him in this life, in this family, on this mountain. Every event since his awakening in that field felt both random and purposeful, coincidental and arranged.

The house's failure was real. Termites didn't follow metaphysical agendas. Rot didn't care about narrative convenience. Yet the outcome—forced proximity to Katsuhito, to Tenchi, to the shrine's daily rhythms—aligned so precisely with what deeper integration required that suspicion felt reasonable.

*You're overthinking*, Dorothy Mae observed. *A leaky roof is a leaky roof. Fix it and move on.*

Sound advice. He let his eyes close.

---

## SCENE 25: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** ~23:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dreams

The white figure appeared again, standing at the edge of perception.

*The house reveals what was hidden*, she said—or didn't say, the words arriving as impression rather than sound. *As will the mountain. As will you.*

*What does that mean?*

No answer. Only presence, watching, patient as stone. Silver hair cascading into spaces that had no floor or ceiling. Eyes that reflected light from sources he couldn't see.

*Rest now*, she offered. *Tomorrow continues what today began.*

He dreamed of his grandmother's kitchen—the smell of baking bread, the yellow light through gingham curtains, the feeling of safety that came from being exactly where he belonged.

When he woke, he would remember the bread but not the figure.
