## PURPOSE

This document provides deep psychological profiles of the Masaki household members as they exist on **April 3, 1989** — the day Sheldon arrives. Understanding their psychological states enables authentic character interactions and reveals the emotional vacuum Sheldon enters.

---

## THE HOUSEHOLD EMOTIONAL SYSTEM

**Core Dynamic:** A household of isolated grief — functioning on the surface, fragmented underneath. Each person holds significant pain alone while maintaining daily routines.

**Communication Pattern:** Much is left unsaid. The death script lies about Kiyone. Yosho's thoughts are private. Nobuyuki doesn't discuss feelings. Rea doesn't voice needs. Tenchi asks "nande?" but gets incomplete answers.

**The Vacuum Sheldon Enters:** Four people who need connection but have learned to cope through isolation, competence, or deflection.

---

## 1. KATSUHITO MASAKI / YOSHO (Age ~730)

### 1.1 Formative Psychology

**CANON (True Tenchi Muyo! Volume 2: Yosho):**

Yosho was "sober and thoughtful from childhood, as a result of feeling responsible for helping his mother Funaho survive Juraian society and politics." This childhood burden shaped his entire psychological architecture.

**The Mother-Protection Complex:**
- His mother Funaho was a commoner from Earth — "a backwater Jurai colony"
- Half the palace was hostile or neutral toward her
- Young Yosho "tried to stay with her as much as he could. He believed that was the only way to help and protect her in his father's place."
- **Psychological Result:** Hypervigilance, emotional suppression, protective instincts overdeveloped

**The Compartmentalization Pattern:**
- At Galaxy Academy, he "gradually became more emotionally expressive through relationships"
- But "every time Yosho would return from Jurai, he would be the same as he was before"
- He learned to maintain separate emotional selves for different contexts
- **Psychological Result:** True self hidden behind functional masks

### 1.2 The Exile Psychology

**Why He Really Left Jurai:**

The official story: He pursued Ryoko after her attack on Jurai.

The real reasons (multiple, layered):
1. **Unrequited love for Misaki** (his stepmother) — painful, inappropriate, never resolved
2. **True love for Airi** — politically impossible to acknowledge
3. **Refusal to marry Ayeka** — he loved her as a sister, not a wife
4. **Escape from court life** — "sharp but seldom showed his emotions" exhausted him
5. **Self-exile from identity** — the prince could die; Katsuhito could live simply

**CANON:** "Unknown to the Juraian Empire, Yosho never wanted to become a ruler and only wanted a quiet peaceful life."

### 1.3 The Immortality Burden

**The Tree Problem:**
- His Royal Tree Funaho "took root" on Earth
- "Juraian royalty can remain immortal only in the range of their trees"
- He is literally bound to Earth — cannot leave without dying
- The gems from Ryoko power the tree for 700+ years

**The Mortality Policy:**

**CANON:** "Although Funaho could conceivably also grant a long life of thousands of years to all of Katsuhito's descendants, his wife Kasumi convinced him that their children should not be forced to live such an extended life."

This wasn't just Kasumi's preference — it became Yosho's rule:
- He watched Kasumi die at 138 (she was "disturbed with her extended life, outliving all of her fellow Earthlings")
- He watched his daughter Kiyone die at 248 (she chose mortality like her predecessor)
- He respects their autonomy but carries the weight of those choices

**The Guilt Question (Unexplored in Canon):**
- Does he second-guess the policy?
- Could he have saved Kiyone if she'd accepted enhancement?
- Does watching descendants choose death feel like failure or respect?

### 1.4 The Love Triangle Across Centuries

**Kasumi (First Wife, Earth):**
- His cousin, rescued during the Ryoko battle
- Married on Earth, bore at least three children
- Chose mortality, died at 138
- Represented his Earth identity — Katsuhito the priest

**Airi (True Love, Space):**
- Met at Galaxy Academy when he was 12, she was 15
- She became pregnant, had the fetus removed and placed in stasis to protect it from her people who "would have killed Yosho's child"
- They have an "open marriage" due to distance and lifespan
- She is "still married and in love" with him
- **CANON:** "Because of the length of their lifespans and the fact they live so far apart, the pair have an open marriage."

**Psychological Complexity:**
- He loves two women across centuries
- One represented escape; one represents his true self
- Kasumi is dead; Airi visits rarely
- He carries both relationships privately

### 1.5 April 1989 Psychological State

**What Sheldon Encounters:**

A 730-year-old man who has:
- Buried his first wife
- Buried his daughter
- Hidden his true identity for 700 years
- Maintained an open marriage across light-years
- Watched descendants choose mortality rather than accept his gift
- Raised his great-great-grandson alone after another loss

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- "His patience is grief made functional"
- Shrine duties provide structure
- Hidden spiritual practice with Funaho tree
- Observes more than speaks
- Guards secrets — the death script, his identity, family connections

**What He Needs (But Won't Ask For):**
- Intellectual companionship from someone who understands longevity
- Validation that his mortality policy isn't cruelty
- Connection to someone who sees past the "elderly priest" mask
- Relief from 700 years of careful watching

**Recognition of Sheldon:**
- Katsuhito "hears footsteps on stairs from step ~250; has been waiting"
- "Recognition: Something familiar in the energy pattern; can't place it"
- His supernatural senses detect Sheldon isn't ordinary
- He will assess slowly, watch carefully, decide deliberately

---

## 2. NOBUYUKI MASAKI (Age ~120)

### 2.1 Childhood Trauma

**CANON:** "Nobuyuki's parents died when he was a boy and he didn't have many friends his own age."

This orphaning created:
- Attachment hunger
- Loneliness that made Kiyone's attention precious despite its cruelty
- Willingness to endure mistreatment for connection
- Pattern of accepting difficult relationships rather than risking abandonment

### 2.2 The Kiyone Relationship

**The Courtship (Decades of Torment):**

**CANON:** "Kiyone would spend time and play with him, but would also perform cruel pranks on him regularly. She nicknamed him 'Nobu.'"

**CANON:** "Via Nobuyuki's journals... Kiyone inflicted 'psychological terror' in their relationship."

**CANON:** "When he grew up, he surprised Kiyone and the Masaki Village by proposing to her. Having seen Kiyone's history of teasing Nobuyuki so regularly, the villagers actually wondered if he had some sort of brain damage."

**Psychological Interpretation:**
- Nobuyuki learned that love comes with pain
- Her attention (even negative) was preferable to loneliness
- He may have genuinely enjoyed her energy, chaos, challenge
- Marriage "mellowed her out some" — validation that his persistence paid off
- He understood her love language was pranks

**The Marriage:**
- She was already over 140 years old when they married
- She appeared young despite her age
- They had Tennyo (~1910) then Tenchi (1984) — decades apart
- He knew she was alien/Juraian (kept it secret from Tenchi)

### 2.3 Grief and the Death Script

**CANON:** "Kiyone died when Tenchi was still a young boy."

**CANON:** "Nobuyuki admitted that it was because of that fictitious story that they hesitated to tell him about the truth behind Kiyone's death or that Kiyone was also a prankster."

**The Performance of Grief:**
- Nobuyuki must tell his son lies about how his mother died
- The death script (written by Kiyone and Airi) contains "extremely morbidly-humorous" fake stories
- He performs these stories while carrying real grief
- He can never process loss honestly with his child

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- Humor as armor — "perverted jokes are armor"
- Work obsession — throws himself into architecture
- Physical absence — works in city, visits weekends
- Delegation — leaves Tenchi with Katsuhito/Rea
- Compartmentalization — keeps grief private, only Yosho sees through

**CANON:** "Hides grief behind comedy" / "Only Yosho sees through his mask"

### 2.4 The Rea Complication

**Canon Timeline:**
- Rea was discovered by Kiyone ~1984
- Kiyone kept Rea's origin secret
- After Kiyone's death, Rea took over household duties
- Nobuyuki marries Rea in Fall 1994 (five years after story start)

**The Psychological Complexity:**

**CANON:** "While Tenchi may be getting a new step-mother in Rea, Nobuyuki admits that he knows Tenchi will have some problems seeing her as one, because Tenchi also had his own crush on her when he was growing up."

In April 1989:
- Rea is ~15-17, a teenager managing his household
- Nobuyuki is ~120 (appearing middle-aged)
- She took over his wife's role after Kiyone died
- The eventual marriage isn't happening yet, but the emotional dynamics are forming
- He relies on her competence while remaining emotionally distant

### 2.5 April 1989 Psychological State

**What Sheldon Encounters:**

A widower approximately three years post-loss who:
- Visits weekends while working in Kurashiki
- Performs grief through jokes rather than processing it
- Tells his son lies about his mother's death
- Relies on a teenage girl to run his household
- Maintains emotional distance from everyone except (sometimes) Yosho

**What He Needs (But Won't Ask For):**
- Permission to grieve honestly
- Someone to share the burden of secrets
- Connection to his son that doesn't require performance
- Acknowledgment that his difficult marriage was still love

**Weekend Dynamic:**
- Arrives with energy and jokes
- Tenchi is excited to see him
- Rea reports on the week
- Katsuhito observes quietly
- Real emotions stay hidden

---

## 3. TENCHI MASAKI (Age 4, turning 5 on Day 22)

### 3.1 The Mother Loss

**CANON:** "Kiyone died when Tenchi was still a young boy" — specifically age 2-3.

**CANON (OVA Episode 5):** "Little Tenchi is seen crying and sobbing for his mom, and an also saddened Ryoko can only watch."

**What a 2-3 Year Old Experiences:**
- Pre-verbal grief — feelings without language
- Confusion more than understanding
- Disruption of attachment patterns
- Somatic memory rather than narrative memory

### 3.2 The Memory Confusion

**CRITICAL CANON REVELATION:**

**CANON:** "When Tenchi finds out that all the positive memories he attributes to his mother were actually just him superimposing Kiyone's image onto Rea's actions, he realizes he hated his real mother enough that he effectively erased her from his mind, which makes him feel seriously guilty."

**Psychological Interpretation for April 1989:**
- At age 4, Tenchi has fragmentary "memories" of his mother
- Many of these are actually memories of Rea caring for him
- His brain has merged the two — the woman in photos (Kiyone) and the woman who feeds/bathes him (Rea)
- He doesn't consciously know this yet

**Why He "Erased" Kiyone:**
- "The mother he remembers quietly smiling at him was probably just her smiling at a joke at his expense"
- Kiyone's love language was pranks — difficult for a toddler to understand
- Rea's love language is nurturing care — easier for a child to receive
- His unconscious chose the gentler memory

### 3.3 The Death Script's Impact

**What Tenchi Believes:**
- His mother died in some dramatic way (one of the fake stories)
- "Mama is in heaven" — grandfather's gentle explanation
- The stories are designed to make him laugh through grief

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- The stories are fabricated
- His mother was 248 years old
- His mother was half-alien
- His entire family history is hidden from him

**CANON:** "Before the ceremony, Tenchi was initially angry when he found out that the story he was told about how his late mother, Kiyone, died was fictitious."

This anger comes later (OVA 3-5). In April 1989, he trusts the stories completely.

### 3.4 Attachment Psychology

**Current Attachment Figures:**
1. **Katsuhito** — primary daytime guardian, safety, stories
2. **Rea** — meals, bath, bedtime, emotional nurturing ("Rea-nee")
3. **Nobuyuki** — weekend excitement, but inconsistent presence

**Attachment Style Indicators:**
- "Will attach to Sheldon quickly as another caring adult"
- Seeks nurturing presence — hunger for maternal connection
- Fears: "dark, being alone, the cave grandfather told him never to enter"
- Loves: stories, play, helping, routine

**CANON (Future Insight):** "All realize that she [Minaho] can serve a role as a sort of mother figure to Tenchi, which he has always missed."

The mother-shaped void persists into adulthood.

### 3.5 The Ryoko Connection (Unknown to Him)

**CANON:** "Ryoko reminisces about watching Tenchi grow up from afar (her conscience was watching him while she was sealed away)."

**CANON:** "She was able to see Tenchi at several points in his life, watching as he grew from a baby all the way up into being the teenager."

**CANON:** "It's believed this was part of Yosho's plan, as he believed seeing someone experience an actual childhood could help her develop eventually."

While Tenchi doesn't know it, he has been watched by someone who genuinely cares — a sealed demon learning humanity through his childhood.

### 3.6 April 1989 Psychological State

**What Sheldon Encounters:**

A 4-year-old boy who:
- Lost his mother at 2-3 and doesn't fully understand it
- Has confused memories of mother (Kiyone) and caretaker (Rea)
- Believes false stories about his mother's death
- Attaches quickly to caring adults
- Is curious, open, and emotionally hungry
- Has a nightlight because he fears the dark
- Avoids the forbidden cave on grandfather's orders

**What He Needs:**
- Consistent nurturing presence
- Another adult to attach to
- Someone who engages with his endless questions
- Play companionship grandfather can't fully provide
- Stability and routine

**How He'll Respond to Sheldon:**
- Initial shyness (stranger)
- Quick warming if Sheldon is gentle
- Testing through questions and requests
- Attachment if Sheldon proves reliable

---

## 4. REA MASAKI (Age ~15-17)

### 4.1 Origin Trauma

**CANON:** "Rea was one of three preteen-aged artificial humans created on Geminar to be Seikijin pilots to fight against Gaia."

**CANON:** "One night on Geminar, Rea was messing with an experimental teleportation device and found herself on Earth."

**What This Means Psychologically:**
- She was created for a purpose (piloting war machines)
- She was accidentally displaced from her world
- She arrived as a confused preteen with no understanding of Earth
- Her entire existence is defined by a mission she didn't choose

### 4.2 The Command Programming

**CRITICAL CANON:**

**CANON:** "She immediately became bound by the unbreakable orders to mate with a human male and produce an offspring to be sent back to Geminar to defeat Gaia."

**CANON:** "If Rea attempted to 'not' complete the mission of sending Kenshi to Geminar, she would be killed by the failsafes built into her body."

**CANON:** "Rea's bio-programming was starting to give her excruciating pain because the child was not sent back as planned."

**Psychological Implications for 1989:**
- She carries a compulsory command she cannot override
- The command affects her emotional processing
- She may not fully feel fear/anxiety the way humans do
- Her competence may be partially programmed, not learned
- She is living with a ticking clock she cannot stop

### 4.3 The Kiyone Bond

**CANON:** "After her arrival on Earth, she was found by MASAKI Kiyone... She was then later adopted into the Masaki family."

**CANON:** "Kiyone let Rea in on the secret of the Masaki family (their connection to the vast space empire controlled by Jurai and the advanced technology)."

**CANON:** "When 'Kiyone-oneesama' died, Rea took it upon herself to help Nobuyuki raise Tenchi."

**What Kiyone Was to Rea:**
- Rescuer — found her confused and injured
- Protector — kept her origin secret
- Mentor — taught her cooking, household management
- Confidant — the ONLY person who knew her true nature
- Mother figure — called "Kiyone-oneesama"

**The Loss:**
- Kiyone died when Rea was ~13
- Rea lost her only confidant
- She inherited Kiyone's responsibilities
- No one else knows her secret
- She carries this alone

### 4.4 The Suppressed Self

**CANON:** "After Kenshi is sent to Geminar, Rea is freed from the command that forced her, and she has a breakdown as she's finally able to feel the fear for him that the command had been overriding."

**CANON:** "Rea even acknowledges it is strange for her not to feel anything in terms of sending Kenshi to Geminar."

**What This Reveals:**
- Her emotional responses are partially suppressed by programming
- She is aware something is "strange" about her reactions
- The breakdown proves she HAS feelings — they're just blocked
- She's living in emotional dampening without understanding why

**April 1989 Implications:**
- She may seem "too calm" about difficult situations
- Her competence may feel slightly mechanical
- She doesn't express needs because she can't fully feel them
- She functions rather than lives

### 4.5 The Household Role

**CANON:** "Rea would end up cooking and cleaning house for the Masaki, even though she was a high school student at the time."

**Daily Reality:**
- Wake 5:30 AM to prepare breakfast
- Get Tenchi ready for kindergarten
- Attend high school full day
- Return home, prepare dinner
- Help Tenchi with bath, bedtime
- Do homework
- Manage household
- Sleep

**Psychological Burden:**
- She's 15-17 carrying adult responsibilities
- She has no peer relationships (no time)
- She finds purpose in being needed
- She may not know she CAN ask for help
- Her programming may make service feel natural/mandatory

### 4.6 The Tenchi Confusion

**CANON:** "Tenchi finds out that all the positive memories he attributes to his mother were actually just him superimposing Kiyone's image onto Rea's actions."

**What This Means:**
- Tenchi's "mother memories" are often Rea memories
- She has been his primary female caretaker since age 2-3
- She is more mother to him than sister
- This complicates her future marriage to his father

**Her Perspective:**
- She loves Tenchi like a younger brother
- She stepped into Kiyone's role out of duty and love
- She doesn't know Tenchi confuses her with his mother
- She is creating maternal memories without realizing it

### 4.7 April 1989 Psychological State

**What Sheldon Encounters:**

A teenage artificial human who:
- Carries programming she cannot override
- Lost her only confidant (Kiyone) two years ago
- Manages an entire household while attending high school
- May have dampened emotional responses due to programming
- Doesn't voice needs because she can't fully feel them
- Functions as Tenchi's de facto mother at age 15-17
- Knows she's "different" but doesn't understand why

**What She Needs (But Cannot Ask For):**
- Someone to share the household burden
- Recognition that she's still a teenager
- Permission to not be responsible
- Someone who sees her, not just what she does
- Eventually — someone to break the emotional suppression

**How She'll Respond to Sheldon:**
- Initial wariness — protective of Tenchi
- Assessment — is this person a threat or help?
- Potential tension — he disrupts her established role
- Possible relief — if he genuinely helps, she may slowly open

**The Parallel:**
Sheldon was placed by cosmic forces. Rea was displaced by cosmic accident. Both are "found" people with hidden origins. This thematic resonance may create unconscious kinship.

---

## 5. KIYONE MASAKI (Deceased ~1987)

*Included because her psychological imprint shapes the entire household.*

### 5.1 The Prankster Identity

**CANON:** "Incredibly mischievous and even slightly sadistic."

**CANON:** "A hellion" during childhood — "no one could control her."

**CANON:** "Lunatic who loved to write 'idiot' on people's heads."

**CANON:** "Via Nobuyuki's journals... Kiyone inflicted 'psychological terror' in their relationship."

**Psychological Profile:**
- Pranks were her love language
- She showed affection through torment
- Marriage "mellowed her out some" but core nature remained
- Her children experienced her mischief as care
- Only those close to her understood

### 5.2 The Death Script Psychology

**CANON:** "Before her death, Kiyone created an elaborate, darkly humorous script instructing her family how to inform Tenchi of her passing."

**CANON:** "Co-written with her mother Airi."

**Why She Did This:**
1. **Control** — She couldn't control dying; she controlled the narrative
2. **Protection** — Truth would reveal family secrets too early
3. **Love** — Her love language was pranks; this IS how she says goodbye
4. **Legacy** — She wanted to be remembered as herself, not as tragedy

**The Cruelty/Kindness Paradox:**
- The script forces her family to lie to her son
- But it's designed to make him laugh through grief
- She prioritized his emotional survival over his truth
- Her final act was a prank — consistent with her entire life

### 5.3 The Rea Secret

**CANON:** "Kiyone never told a single other person about it [Rea's origin] before dying."

**CANON:** "She secretly conducted exhaustive research at Galaxy Academy to help fulfill Rea's mission."

**What This Reveals:**
- Kiyone could keep secrets despite being a prankster
- She took Rea's burden seriously
- She spent years trying to help without telling anyone
- Her death left Rea's secret orphaned

**CANON:** "Her hidden studies eventually provided crucial insights that took her daughter Tennyo years to decipher, revealing 'a brilliant, although untrained, mind.'"

### 5.4 Her Ghost in the Household

**Absence as Presence:**
- Photos throughout the house (Tennyo's resemblance makes them strange)
- Her garden remains unfinished
- Her cooking style lives through Rea
- Her pranks echo in family stories (that Tenchi believes are real)
- Her death script still shapes what Tenchi knows

**What Each Person Carries:**
- **Yosho:** Another descendant who chose mortality. Respect and grief.
- **Nobuyuki:** The woman who tormented and loved him. Unprocessed loss behind jokes.
- **Tenchi:** A confusion of mother and caretaker. Memories that aren't quite hers.
- **Rea:** The only person who knew her fully. A secret she now carries alone.

## 6. HOUSEHOLD DYNAMICS SYNTHESIS

### 6.1 The Grief Topology

```
YOSHO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        |
        | (buried Kasumi, buried Kiyone, guards secrets)
        |
        └── grief expressed as: patience, observation

NOBUYUKI ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
        |
        | (lost wife, performs death script, absent)
        |
        └── grief expressed as: jokes, work, distance

REA ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        |
        | (lost Kiyone-oneesama, carries secret alone)
        |
        └── grief expressed as: competence, suppression

TENCHI ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
        |
        | (lost mother at 2-3, confused memories)
        |
        └── grief expressed as: attachment hunger, questions
```

### 6.2 The Secret Topology

| Secret | Who Knows | Who Doesn't |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Kiyone's death was natural aging at 248 | Yosho, Nobuyuki, Airi, Tennyo | Tenchi, Rea |
| The death script stories are fabricated | Yosho, Nobuyuki, Airi, Tennyo | Tenchi |
| Yosho is actually Prince Yosho of Jurai | Yosho, Nobuyuki, Airi, off-planet family | Tenchi, Rea |
| Rea is an artificial human from Geminar | Rea (only she knows in 1989) | Everyone else |
| Rea carries a compulsory command | Rea | Everyone |
| The family has galactic connections | Adults | Tenchi |

### 6.3 What Sheldon Disrupts

**The Isolation Equilibrium:**
- Each person has found a way to cope alone
- Sheldon's arrival forces interaction
- A stranger who STAYS changes household dynamics

**Rea's Role:**
- She has been THE caretaker
- Sheldon's presence challenges her position
- Will she feel replaced, relieved, or both?

**Katsuhito's Watchfulness:**
- He will assess Sheldon carefully
- Sheldon's unusual energy signature triggers attention
- Trust must be earned over time

**Tenchi's Attachment:**
- He will attach quickly if Sheldon is kind
- Another caring adult fills a void
- This attachment will be genuine and fast

**Nobuyuki's Distance:**
- Weekend visitor may see Sheldon as useful
- But may also feel threatened by someone who's more present
- His pattern is avoidance — will he engage?

**END OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES**
