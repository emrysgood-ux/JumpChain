The first thing Sheldon Carter became aware of was grass.

It pressed against his left cheek, individual blades cool and slightly
damp, their edges soft rather than sharp. The smell of it filled his
nostrils with each shallow breath: chlorophyll and wet earth and
something indefinably alive, the green scent of growing things that he
associated with summer lawns and childhood afternoons in his
grandmother\'s backyard in Georgia.

He did not move.

His body lay still, pressed into soil that gave slightly beneath his
weight, and his mind floated somewhere above it, not yet ready to engage
with the question of why he was lying face-down in grass when he should
not be lying anywhere at all.

The last thing he remembered was the lab.

The memory surfaced slowly, reluctantly, as though some part of him did
not want to examine it too closely. The containment field had been
fluctuating for three hours, the readings dancing across acceptable
thresholds in patterns that made Dr. Morrison nervous and made Sheldon
reach for more coffee. They had been running on minimal sleep for days,
pushing toward a breakthrough that the funding committee needed to see
before the quarterly review. The experimental drive core sat in its
housing like a captured star, dense with potential energy, humming at
frequencies that made Sheldon\'s teeth ache.

Then the magnetic coils had failed.

Not gradually, not with warning. One moment the readings were elevated
but stable. The next, every alarm in the facility was screaming. Sheldon
remembered the sound of Dr. Morrison shouting something, the words lost
in the cacophony. He remembered turning toward the containment unit,
seeing the light inside it shift from controlled blue to something
wilder, whiter, hungrier. He remembered the sensation of heat against
his face, far too much heat far too fast.

He remembered pain.

White and absolute, erasing thought. The feeling of every nerve in his
body igniting simultaneously, a full-system overload that his brain
could not process into anything coherent. He remembered knowing, with
terrible clarity, that he was dying. That the energy being released was
enough to vaporize everything within fifty meters. That there would be
nothing left of him to bury.

And then.

Warmth.

Not the warmth of the containment failure, which had been violent and
consuming. This was different. Gentle. Encompassing. Like being wrapped
in something soft, something that did not burn but soothed. Like being
carried through water that did not resist. Like being held by hands that
he could not see but could somehow feel, impossibly tender, impossibly
safe.

There had been light, he thought. Not the terrible light of the accident
but something else. Something that did not hurt to look at. Something
that felt, impossibly, like coming home.

And there had been a voice. Maybe. Or the memory of a voice. Words he
could not quite hear, spoken in a tone he could not quite identify,
conveying something he could not quite understand. Comfort, perhaps. Or
welcome. Or simply presence, the knowledge that he was not alone in
whatever space between spaces he had fallen into.

Then nothing.

And now grass.

Sheldon lay still and breathed and tried to reconcile these facts into
something that made sense. He had died. He was certain he had died. The
containment failure had released enough energy to vaporize the entire
lab wing. There was no surviving that. No waking up in a hospital bed
with concerned doctors explaining that he had been very lucky. No
miraculous escape route that his traumatized brain had simply forgotten.

He had died, and now he was lying in grass, and these two facts could
not both be true.

Except, apparently, they were.

He opened his eyes.

The world resolved itself slowly, his vision adjusting to the brightness
after the darkness behind his closed lids. Green filled his field of
view: blades of grass rising from dark soil, close enough that he could
see the individual veins in each leaf, the tiny droplets of moisture
clinging to their surfaces. Beyond the grass, more grass, stretching
away in a gentle slope toward a horizon he could not see from this
angle.

The sky was visible at the edge of his vision, a strip of blue between
the grass and the curve of his own cheek. Not the pale, washed-out blue
of Alaska in late autumn, filtered through clouds and ice crystals and
the perpetual twilight of the approaching polar night. This was a deep,
rich blue, saturated and warm, the kind of sky he remembered from
childhood summers before he left for MIT and never really went back.

Birds were singing somewhere nearby. Multiple species, their calls
layered over each other in a complex pattern that suggested early
morning, the dawn chorus that preceded the full heat of day. He did not
recognize any of the songs. The birds of Fairbanks had different voices,
different rhythms, different conversations.

Sheldon moved his fingers.

It was a small motion, experimental, testing whether his body still
responded to commands. His right hand was resting palm-down in the grass
beside his head, and his fingers flexed against the soil, curling and
uncurling, each joint articulating smoothly. No pain. No resistance. No
indication that anything was wrong.

He moved his other hand. Same result. Then his toes, inside shoes he did
not remember putting on. Then his arms, pushing against the ground,
beginning the process of levering himself upward.

His body cooperated with a fluidity that surprised him.

The gym had been a requirement of his position at the research facility.
The company that funded their work believed that healthy employees were
productive employees, and they had built mandatory fitness hours into
everyone\'s contract. Sheldon had never minded. His grandmother had
raised him to take care of himself, and he had maintained a disciplined
routine throughout his adult life: weights three times a week, cardio
twice, flexibility work daily, occasional martial arts when he could
find an instructor who did not treat his height as a limitation. At
thirty-eight, he had been in the best shape of his life, his waistline
steady at thirty-two inches despite the sedentary nature of theoretical
physics.

But even in the best shape of his life, his body had accumulated the
small complaints of nearly four decades of use. The left knee that had
never quite recovered from an enthusiastic sparring session three years
ago, prone to stiffness after long periods of sitting. The lower back
that protested extended hours at the computer, requiring careful
stretching to keep loose. The right shoulder that clicked sometimes when
he reached overhead, a remnant of a rock-climbing incident in his
twenties.

Those complaints were gone.

He pushed himself to a sitting position and felt nothing but smooth,
easy motion. No catch in the shoulder. No twinge in the back. No protest
from the knee. His body moved the way it had moved when he was
twenty-two, before the accumulated wear of years had taught him to
compensate and adjust and work around.

Sheldon sat in the grass and looked down at his hands.

They were his hands. He knew them intimately: the short fingers, the
broad palms, the particular shade of brown that darkened across his
knuckles and lightened in the creases of his joints. He had looked at
these hands every day for thirty-eight years. He had watched them hold
tools and write equations and cook his grandmother\'s recipes. He had
watched them grip weights and turn pages and gesture during arguments
about quantum mechanics. These were absolutely, unmistakably his hands.

Except.

He turned his right hand over, examining the palm. The skin was smooth
and unmarked, the lines of fate and life and heart etched cleanly into
the flesh. No calluses in the wrong places. No small scars from years of
minor accidents.

No crescent-shaped mark below his thumb.

He had carried that scar since he was nine years old. His grandfather\'s
pocketknife, a whittling project gone wrong, an important lesson about
blade safety that had left its permanent reminder in his flesh. The mark
had been part of his hand for twenty-nine years. He knew exactly where
it should be, could have found it with his eyes closed.

It was not there.

Sheldon stared at his palm for a long moment. Then he turned his hand
back over and examined the backs of his fingers. The calluses were
different. Softer in some places, harder in others, distributed in
patterns that did not match the tools he used or the weights he lifted.
His left wrist, where a soldering accident in grad school had left a
small burn mark, was smooth and unmarked.

He pulled up the sleeve of the shirt he did not remember putting on and
looked at his forearm. The mole that should have been there, the one his
dermatologist had been monitoring for changes, was gone. His skin was
clear and even, the same deep brown it had always been, but somehow
younger. Fresher. Like a photograph that had been digitally restored,
all the accumulated noise and damage carefully removed.

*That is not possible.*

He said it out loud, testing his voice. It came out the same as always:
the slightly hoarse baritone that his grandmother had called his radio
voice, the faint Georgia accent that decades in academic settings had
softened but never quite erased. His voice, at least, remained
unchanged.

Sheldon performed a systematic check of his body, the way he had been
taught during the mandatory safety training that the research facility
required. Starting from the head and working down, cataloging everything
he could observe or feel, noting anything that seemed wrong or different
or simply unexpected.

His head felt fine. No pain, no dizziness, no sense of pressure or
confusion beyond the existential confusion of being alive when he should
not be. His neck turned smoothly through its full range of motion. His
shoulders rolled without catching. His chest expanded and contracted
with each breath, the air flowing easily through lungs that showed no
sign of distress.

His torso was solid, the muscles of his core engaging automatically as
he shifted position. His hips were flexible. His legs responded when he
told them to move. His feet, inside shoes that were not his shoes, felt
comfortable and supported.

Everything worked. Everything felt right.

Everything felt, in fact, better than right. Better than it had felt in
years. His body hummed with a vitality that he associated with his early
twenties, that sense of surplus energy that made sitting still feel like
a waste of potential. He felt like he could run a marathon. Like he
could climb a mountain. Like he could do anything his mind could
conceive of, without the small negotiations and compromises that aging
had taught him to make.

He looked down at himself, at the clothes he did not recognize.

Simple slacks in a neutral gray, well-fitted, made from a fabric that
felt higher quality than anything he typically wore. A white button-down
shirt, also well-fitted, also unfamiliar. The shoes were leather, dark
brown, practical in design but clearly expensive. No lab coat. No ID
badge. No watch.

He patted his pockets, searching for anything that might explain his
situation.

His right front pocket held a wallet.

Sheldon pulled it out and examined it. Leather, worn soft with use, the
kind of wallet that had been carried for years and developed a
comfortable shape. Inside, he found a collection of items that made no
sense.

Bank cards. Multiple bank cards, from institutions he did not recognize,
with names printed on them that were not quite his name. Cash, quite a
lot of it, in bills that looked like Japanese yen but seemed somehow
old-fashioned, the designs simpler than the currency he remembered from
his conference trips to Tokyo. A membership card to something written in
characters he recognized as Japanese but could not immediately read. A
folded piece of paper that turned out to be a property deed.

And a passport.

Sheldon opened the passport with hands that had begun to shake slightly.

The photograph was his face. His exact face, staring back at him with
the neutral expression required for official documentation. But it was
younger than the face he had seen in the mirror that morning in
Fairbanks, before he went to the lab, before everything went wrong. Not
dramatically younger. Just\... fresher. Smoother. The face he remembered
having at MIT, during his first doctorate, before the years had added
their subtle weight.

The name printed beneath the photograph was not his own.

月野 シェルドン.

He read it three times, certain he was misunderstanding. His Japanese
was decent. Better than decent, actually. He had picked it up over years
of reading technical papers, watching unsubtitled anime during grad
school all-nighters, collaborating with colleagues from Japanese
aerospace companies. He could read the characters without difficulty.

Tsukino Sheldon.

The surname meant something like moon-field, or field of the moon. It
was not a common name, but it was a real one. A Japanese surname paired
with his American given name, as though someone had tried to create an
identity that bridged two worlds.

Tsukino.

Like Tsukino Usagi.

The thought arrived unbidden, accompanied by a flash of memory from
decades ago. Late nights in his dorm room, pirated anime streams on a
computer that could barely handle the bandwidth, a blonde girl in a
sailor suit crying about having to save the world when she just wanted
to eat cake and sleep in. Sailor Moon. The magical girl show that had
been inexplicably popular during his undergraduate years, that he had
watched with ironic detachment until the plot got surprisingly serious
and he found himself genuinely invested.

Tsukino Usagi. The protagonist. The crybaby who became a warrior. The
ordinary girl who carried the destiny of the universe on her shoulders.

Her family name was Tsukino.

Sheldon sat in the grass, holding a passport that identified him as a
member of the Tsukino family, and started to laugh.

It came from somewhere deep in his chest, equal parts disbelief and
genuine amusement and something that might have been hysteria if he let
it run too far. Of all the things. Of all the possible ways that dying
and somehow not dying could manifest, the universe or whatever cosmic
bureaucracy was responsible for his situation had given him the surname
of a magical girl from a show he had watched in college.

\"What,\" he said to the empty field, \"am I supposed to be a secret
Tsukino? The son they shipped off to another dimension because he did
not fit the aesthetic? *Sorry, little Usagi, you have a brother, but we
sent him away because magical girl dynasties have specific
requirements*?\"

The field did not answer. Birds continued to sing. A breeze moved
through the grass, making it ripple like water. Somewhere in the
distance, too far away to see, a dog barked twice and then fell silent.

Sheldon\'s laughter faded. He looked at the passport again, at the face
that was his face but younger, at the name that was his name but
different, and tried to think systematically.

This was what he did. This was what he had always done, when confronted
with problems that seemed impossible. He broke them down into
components. He identified what he knew and what he did not know. He
formed hypotheses and tested them against available evidence. He did not
panic, because panic was not useful, and Sheldon Carter had spent his
entire life being useful.

Fact: He had been in the lab in Fairbanks. He remembered this clearly.
The coffee growing cold on his desk. The hum of the equipment. Dr.
Morrison\'s nervous pacing. The fluctuating readings on the containment
field.

Fact: The experimental drive had destabilized. The magnetic coils had
failed. The energy release had been catastrophic. He had felt himself
dying, had known with absolute certainty that he was being unmade at the
molecular level.

Fact: He was now sitting in a field that was emphatically not Alaska, in
a body that was his but younger and unmarked by the history he
remembered living, holding documentation that identified him as someone
he had never been.

Hypothesis: He had been isekaied.

The word surfaced in his mind with the same ease as the Sailor Moon
reference. He had consumed enough anime and light novels over the years
to recognize the pattern. Person dies in original world. Person wakes up
in new world, usually one based on some fictional property they were
familiar with. Person receives special abilities or system interface to
help them navigate their new circumstances. Adventures ensue.

It was absurd. It was impossible. It violated every law of physics he
had spent his career studying.

It was also the only framework that made any sense of his current
situation.

\"Okay,\" he said out loud, because hearing his own voice helped anchor
him in reality, whatever reality this was. \"Working hypothesis: isekai
scenario. I died, I got transported, I am now somewhere else. Let us
test that.\"

He closed his eyes and tried to summon something.

The conventions of the genre suggested there should be some kind of
interface. A status screen floating in his vision, perhaps, displaying
his attributes and abilities in convenient numerical form. An inventory
system that would let him store objects in some pocket dimension. A
quest log detailing his objectives. A helpful voice in his head
explaining the rules of his new existence.

He concentrated. Focused. Reached for whatever mechanism might be
waiting to respond to his attention.

Nothing happened.

He tried thinking the word \'status\' as clearly as he could, imagining
it as a command, a key that would unlock whatever system was supposed to
be managing his situation.

Still nothing.

He tried \'menu.\' Nothing. \'System.\' Nothing. \'Help.\' Nothing.
\'Interface.\' Nothing. \'Character sheet,\' \'abilities,\'
\'inventory,\' \'quest log,\' \'tutorial.\'

Nothing, nothing, nothing.

Either the isekai conventions did not apply here, or the system was not
responding to standard commands, or there was no system at all and his
hypothesis was wrong.

Sheldon opened his eyes and looked around more carefully.

He was sitting in what appeared to be an uncultivated patch of grass
between agricultural fields. Rice paddies stretched away to his left,
their flooded surfaces reflecting the blue sky, green shoots rising from
the water in neat rows that spoke of careful cultivation. To his right,
more fields, these ones dry, planted with something he could not
identify from this distance. Ahead of him, the grass continued for
perhaps fifty meters before giving way to a line of trees, their leaves
thick and green, their trunks dark with shadow.

Behind him, when he turned to look, he saw mountains.

They rose against the sky in layers of blue-green, their slopes covered
in dense forest, their peaks lost in a haze of distance. Not the
mountains of Alaska, which he knew intimately from years of living in
their shadow. These were different mountains, shaped by different
geology, wearing different clothes of vegetation. Japanese mountains, if
his guess about the yen and the characters was correct. The kind of
mountains that appeared in woodblock prints and travel photographs,
ancient and patient and thoroughly foreign.

The air confirmed his suspicion. It was warm and humid, carrying the
smell of growing rice and distant forest and something else, something
floral that he could not identify. Not the dry cold of Alaska in late
autumn, where his breath would have been visible and his exposed skin
would have been complaining. This was spring or early summer, the kind
of weather that invited you to sit outside and do nothing.

Sheldon got to his feet.

The motion was easy, his body responding with that unfamiliar fluidity,
and he took a moment to simply stand and experience the sensation. His
center of balance was the same. His height was the same, five foot four,
compact and dense, the build his grandmother had called sturdy and his
college roommate had called hobbit-like. But everything felt lighter.
More responsive. Like the difference between a new car and one with two
hundred thousand miles on the odometer.

He looked down at his hands again, flexing his fingers, watching the
tendons move beneath unblemished skin.

Whatever had happened to him, whoever or whatever had brought him here,
they had rebuilt him. Kept the essential structure but removed the
accumulated damage. Given him back the body he had worn at twenty, maybe
twenty-two, before the years had started their slow process of erosion.

It should have been a gift. It probably was a gift, from a certain
perspective. But standing in a field in a body that was his but not
quite his, holding documentation for a life he had never lived, Sheldon
found it difficult to feel grateful.

He felt, instead, profoundly lost.

The property deed in his wallet caught his attention again. He unfolded
it and examined it more closely, trying to extract whatever information
it could provide.

The document was written in formal Japanese, the kind of legal language
that required careful attention to parse. It described a property in
Okayama Prefecture: a building and associated land, transferred to
Tsukino Sheldon on a date that used a Japanese era year he did not
immediately recognize. The address was detailed enough to locate on a
map, if he had a map, which he did not.

Okayama Prefecture. Western Japan, if he remembered his geography
correctly. Facing the Inland Sea. Known for\... he struggled to
remember. Something about peaches, maybe. And castles. One of the
regions that tourists visited on their way to more famous destinations.

He had never been to Okayama. He had no idea why he would have property
there. The documentation claimed it was his, but he had never arranged
for it, never signed for it, never even thought about owning property in
Japan.

Someone had prepared this for him. Someone had known he was coming.

The thought sent a chill down his spine that had nothing to do with the
temperature.

Something flickered at the edge of his awareness.

It was not visual, not exactly. More like a pressure behind his eyes, a
sense of something trying to communicate. Sheldon focused on it
instinctively, the way he would focus on a subtle anomaly in
experimental data, giving it his full attention.

The pressure resolved into something almost like text. Almost, but not
quite. The information arrived as knowledge rather than words, blooming
into his consciousness like memories of things he had always known but
never thought about.

*Physical form reconstructed. Baseline specifications maintained.
Documentation established.*

Sheldon stood very still.

\"Hello?\" he said. \"Is someone there? System? Interface? Whatever you
are?\"

The presence, if that was what it was, did not respond to his voice. But
after a moment, another fragment of information arrived, pushing gently
against his awareness.

*Current location: Okayama Prefecture, Japan. Current date: April 3,
1989.*

1989\.

Sheldon\'s legs went weak. He sat down heavily in the grass, not quite
falling but not quite choosing to sit either, his body simply deciding
that standing was too difficult while processing this information.

1989\. He was in 1989.

Two years after he had been born.

He had been born on August 21, 1987, in a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia,
to parents who had not been ready for a child and would eventually prove
that by leaving him with his grandmother and disappearing into their own
troubled lives. In 1989, his mother was twenty-five years old, already
deep into the pattern of absence that had led her to leave him with his
grandmother two years ago.

He was in a world where he already existed—a two-year-old child in
Atlanta, being raised by his grandmother while his parents drifted
away. Somewhere in Georgia, the younger version of himself was learning
to walk, forming his first words, completely unaware that a future
version of him had just appeared on the other side of the world.

\"Okay,\" he said, his voice unsteady. \"Okay. Time displacement too.
Not just where but when. That is\... that is fine. I can work with that.
I have worked with weirder things.\"

He had not, actually, worked with weirder things. Theoretical physics
involved some strange concepts, but nothing that compared to sitting in
a field in 1989 in a body that should not exist, holding documentation
for a life he had never lived, receiving cryptic information from a
presence that refused to explain itself.

\"Can you tell me more?\" he asked the presence. \"Why I am here? What I
am supposed to do? Who arranged all of this?\"

Silence. The presence had retreated, or gone dormant, or simply decided
that it had provided enough information for now. He could feel it at the
edge of his awareness, like a door that had closed but not locked, but
his attempts to open it produced nothing.

\"Not helpful,\" he muttered. \"Some commands work, others do not. No
clear interface, no visible display, no explanation of the rules.\" He
filed this away as data, another piece of the puzzle. \"Either this is a
very limited system, or there are rules I do not understand yet, or I am
completely wrong about what is happening.\"

He forced himself to stand again. Forced himself to think practically.
Whatever was happening, whatever had brought him here, whatever
mysteries remained unsolved, he was alive and he was somewhere and he
needed to figure out what to do next.

The sun was well above the horizon, angled in a way that suggested
mid-morning. That gave him most of a day to work with. The presence had
said he was in Okayama Prefecture, which meant he was in Japan, which
meant the nearest town or village probably had people who could help him
orient himself.

He needed to find civilization. He needed to understand where exactly he
was. He needed to figure out what year it actually was, because trusting
a cryptic voice in his head seemed unwise.

He needed to move.

Sheldon picked a direction that seemed likely to lead toward the road he
could barely see in the distance, a thin gray line between green fields,
and started walking.

The path along the edge of the rice paddy was narrow but well-worn,
packed earth that had been walked by countless feet over countless
years. Sheldon followed it carefully, staying clear of the flooded
fields, watching where he placed each step.

The walking gave him time to think. Perhaps too much time.

His mind kept returning to the moment of death. To the light and the
pain and the terrible certainty that he was being unmade. And then to
the warmth that had followed, the impossible gentleness of whatever had
caught him as he fell. He remembered the sensation of being held, of
being carried, of being safe in a way that defied all logic. He
remembered the suggestion of a voice, of words he could not quite hear.

He did not remember anything else.

Between the warmth and the grass, there was nothing. A gap in his
existence, a stretch of time or non-time that his mind could not access.
He had been dying, and then he had been held, and then he had been lying
in a field in Japan in 1989. Whatever happened in between, whatever
process had transported him here and rebuilt him and arranged
documentation and property, remained completely opaque.

He thought about the warmth, turning the memory over like a stone in his
hand.

Near-death experiences were well-documented phenomena. Tunnels of light,
feelings of peace, the sense of leaving one\'s body and looking down
from above. Scientists had various explanations: oxygen deprivation
causing hallucinations, the brain flooding itself with chemicals as
systems failed, evolutionary adaptations to make the process of dying
less terrifying. Sheldon had read the papers, understood the theories,
filed them away as interesting but not personally relevant.

But his brain had not been dying. His brain had been destroyed, along
with the rest of him, in an instant of catastrophic energy release.
There had been no time for gradual oxygen deprivation, no opportunity
for chemical floods, no slow process that might have produced comforting
visions.

Whatever he had experienced in that moment between death and rebirth, it
was not a near-death experience. It was something else entirely.

The path connected to a larger trail, which wound between the fields
toward the road he had seen from the clearing. Sheldon walked steadily,
not hurrying but not dawdling either, finding a rhythm that his new-old
body seemed to appreciate. His legs moved easily, his breath came
without effort, his heart maintained a steady pace that spoke of
reserves he had not realized he possessed.

This body was fit. Not just fit in the way his old body had been fit,
maintained through discipline and routine, but fit in some deeper way.
Like an athlete at peak condition, ready for anything, carrying no extra
weight and no accumulated fatigue.

He wondered if this was how he had felt at twenty-two, before years of
desk work and conference travel and late nights in the lab had slowly
eroded the baseline. He thought it might be. He could not quite
remember, those years too distant now to recall with precision, but the
feeling was familiar in a way that suggested recognition rather than
novelty.

The trail reached the road, and Sheldon stopped to assess his options.

The road was paved but narrow, two lanes without sidewalks, the asphalt
worn but well-maintained. The markings were simple, painted lines that
looked slightly different from what he was used to, the style of a
different era or a different country or both. Power lines ran along one
side, wooden poles weathered gray by sun and rain, wires strung between
them in a pattern that spoke of mid-twentieth-century infrastructure.

To his left, the road curved away between rice paddies, disappearing
behind a stand of trees. To his right, it climbed slightly, heading
toward the mountains that loomed in the distance. Neither direction
offered obvious signs of habitation, no buildings visible from where he
stood, no sounds of traffic or industry.

A sign stood at the junction of the trail and the road. Hand-painted
characters on weathered wood, pointing in the direction of the
mountains.

Masaki Village. 4 km.

Sheldon read the sign twice, making sure he understood. Masaki. The name
meant something like true sake, or genuine sake, depending on how you
parsed the characters. A village in the mountains, four kilometers
distant. Close enough to walk. Far enough to be a real hike.

The name tugged at something in his memory. He had heard it before. He
was certain he had heard it before. But when he tried to place it, tried
to remember where he had encountered the name Masaki, he came up empty.
It hovered at the edge of recollection, a shape in fog that dissolved
when he tried to look at it directly.

He filed it away for later consideration and started walking toward the
mountains.

The road was quiet. In the first kilometer, he saw no cars, heard no
engines, encountered no other travelers. The silence was profound after
the constant low-level noise of modern life: no airplanes overhead, no
distant highway hum, no electronic devices filling the background with
their subtle frequencies. Just the wind in the trees, the birds in the
sky, the soft sound of his own footsteps on the asphalt.

1989\. The thought kept returning, refusing to be filed away with the
other mysteries. He was in 1989, which meant he was in a world without
personal computers, without cell phones, without the internet. A world
where long-distance communication required landlines or letters. A world
where information moved slowly, where isolation was possible in ways it
would not be possible in the future he remembered.

He thought about what he knew of 1989. George Bush had just been
inaugurated in January, succeeding Reagan. The Cold War was thawing—the
Berlin Wall would fall before year's end. Japan was riding the peak of
its bubble economy, real estate prices at surreal heights, the Nikkei
stock index touching levels that would seem impossible in hindsight.

And here in Japan specifically: Emperor Hirohito had died on January 7th,
ending the Showa era after sixty-four years. The nation was now in
the Heisei era—"achieving peace"—under the new Emperor Akihito. The
transition was still fresh, only three months old. People would still be
adjusting to writing the new era name on forms, still processing the
change from an emperor who had reigned through war and recovery to one
who promised a gentler future.

It was, from his perspective, the distant past. A world that existed
only in history books and old movies, populated by people who did not
know what was coming, who could not imagine the transformations that the
next four decades would bring.

And he was in it. Carrying thirty-eight years of memories from a future
that had not happened yet. Knowing things that no one else could know,
understanding patterns that had not yet emerged, possessing the
perspective of someone who had watched the story unfold.

He was not sure if that was an advantage or a burden. Maybe both.

A farmhouse appeared ahead, set back from the road behind a neatly
maintained garden. An elderly woman was hanging laundry on a line, her
movements slow and practiced, her attention focused on her work. She
looked up as Sheldon approached, and he saw her expression shift through
several stages: confusion, surprise, wariness, curiosity.

He understood. He was a Black man walking alone on a rural Japanese road
in 1989. This was probably not a common sight. This was probably, if he
was being honest with himself, an unprecedented sight for many of the
people he would encounter.

Sheldon slowed his pace and offered a polite nod, keeping his body
language open and unthreatening. The woman nodded back after a moment,
her wariness fading slightly, and returned to her laundry. He continued
walking, feeling her gaze on his back until the road curved and she
passed out of sight.

This was going to be his reality, he realized. For as long as he stayed
in rural Japan in 1989, he was going to be conspicuous. Memorable. The
kind of person that people talked about after he passed, wondering who
he was and where he had come from and what he was doing there.

He had dealt with being the only Black person in the room before.
Graduate seminars at MIT, where the physics department\'s diversity had
been, to put it charitably, a work in progress. Research conferences in
Europe and Asia, where his face stood out in crowds of colleagues.
Faculty meetings at institutions that talked about inclusion but
struggled to achieve it.

He knew how to navigate those spaces. How to be professional and
competent and unthreatening, how to let his work speak for itself, how
to ignore the looks and the assumptions and the occasional overt
rudeness. He had developed those skills over decades, polishing them
through necessity, learning which battles to fight and which to let
pass.

But this was different. This was not a conference room or a lecture
hall, where the norms of professional behavior provided some protection.
This was a foreign country in an era he did not belong to, where the
rules were different and his usual strategies might not apply.

He would have to be careful. More careful than he was used to being.
More aware of how he was perceived, how he was interpreted, how his
presence affected the people around him.

The road continued to climb, winding between increasingly forested
hills. The rice paddies gave way to vegetable gardens, then to orchards,
then to unmanaged forest pressing close on both sides. The air grew
cooler as he gained elevation, though it remained warm compared to what
he was used to. Insects buzzed in the undergrowth. Birds called from the
canopy overhead.

After perhaps an hour of walking, Sheldon heard the sound of an
approaching engine.

It was a deep, rhythmic rumble, the kind of sound that older vehicles
made before modern engineering smoothed away their personalities. He
turned and saw a bus coming up the road behind him, a boxy vehicle in
faded colors, its windows open to the spring air.

He stepped to the side of the road and raised his hand.

The bus slowed, then stopped. The door opened with a mechanical groan. A
driver looked out at him, a middle-aged man in a simple uniform, his
face registering the same progression of emotions that the farmwoman had
displayed: confusion, surprise, wariness, curiosity.

\"Masaki Village?\" Sheldon asked in Japanese.

The surprise on the driver\'s face deepened. Sheldon understood. His
Japanese was good. Not just functional, not just tourist-level, but
genuinely fluent, the product of years of practice and a natural
facility for languages that his grandmother had always encouraged him to
develop. To hear that level of fluency coming from a face like his, in a
place like this, must have been jarring.

\"Yes,\" the driver said after a long pause. \"Five stops.\"

Sheldon climbed aboard and paid his fare from the old yen bills in his
wallet. The driver accepted the money without comment, though his eyes
lingered on Sheldon\'s face for a moment longer than strictly necessary.

The bus was nearly empty. Two elderly women with shopping bags occupied
seats near the front, their conversation pausing as Sheldon entered. A
teenage boy in a school uniform sat near the back, his attention fixed
on a book in his lap. All of them looked up as Sheldon made his way down
the aisle. All of them stared.

He found a seat in the middle of the bus, by a window, and settled in to
watch the landscape roll past. After a moment, the conversations
resumed, quieter than before, and the bus lurched back into motion.

The road continued to climb, offering glimpses of the countryside
through gaps in the forest. Rice paddies in careful terraces, their
flooded surfaces reflecting the sky. Traditional houses with curved
roofs, their architecture unchanged from centuries past. Shrine gates
visible through the trees, red paint bright against the green. It was
beautiful, in a way that photographs could not capture, the kind of
beauty that came from seeing something with your own eyes, breathing the
air, feeling the warmth of the sun through the window.

It reminded him, in a strange and distant way, of the countryside around
his grandmother\'s house in Georgia. Not the same, not even close to the
same, but something in the quality of the light, the pace of the
agriculture, the sense of lives lived close to the land. Different
continent, different culture, different century, but the same
fundamental relationship between people and place.

His grandmother had grown up on a farm. Had told him stories about it,
when he was young, about the work and the community and the way the
seasons shaped everything. She had left that life for the city, had made
a different kind of life for herself and eventually for him, but she had
never quite stopped missing the rhythms of the land.

He wondered what she would think if she could see him now. Sitting on a
bus in rural Japan, two years after his own birth, wearing a body
that had been rebuilt from whatever remained of him after he died. She
had been a practical woman, his grandmother, not given to excessive
speculation about the nature of reality. But she had also believed in
things that could not be measured or proven: the power of prayer, the
presence of ancestors, the existence of grace in a world that often
seemed graceless.

She would have had questions, certainly. But she would have also told
him to stop worrying about what he could not understand and focus on
what he could do. That was her way. That had always been her way.

\"Excuse me.\"

Sheldon turned. One of the elderly women had moved to the seat across
the aisle and was studying him with bright, curious eyes. Her expression
held no hostility, only the frank interest of someone encountering
something new.

\"Your Japanese is very good,\" she said. \"Are you a tourist?\"

\"Researcher,\" Sheldon replied. \"On sabbatical. I am looking for a
quiet place to work.\"

\"Ah.\" She nodded as though this explained everything. \"The
universities send people out here sometimes. The mountain air is
supposed to be good for thinking.\" Her eyes crinkled with warmth. \"Are
you going to the shrine?\"

\"Shrine?\"

\"The Masaki Shrine. It is the main attraction in the village, if you
can call anything out here an attraction.\" She smiled. \"Old
Katsuhito-san maintains it. He is unusual, but kind. Sometimes he takes
in visitors.\"

Masaki. Katsuhito.

The names hit him with a force that surprised him. He knew these names.
He was suddenly, viscerally certain that he knew these names. Not from a
passing reference, not from casual encounter, but from something
significant, something he had spent time with, something that mattered.

But the memory would not surface. It hovered just out of reach, a shape
in darkness that dissolved when he tried to grasp it.

\"Thank you,\" he said, keeping his voice steady. \"I will look into
it.\"

The woman nodded and returned to her seat, resuming her conversation
with her companion. Sheldon turned back to the window, but his attention
was elsewhere, chasing the ghost of a memory that refused to be caught.

*Masaki. Katsuhito. Shrine. Okayama. Something about a lake?*

Nothing. Just the maddening sense that he should know, that the answer
was right there if he could only remember.

The bus wheezed through four more stops, letting off passengers and
picking up new ones, before the driver called out the name Sheldon was
waiting for.

\"Masaki Village. Last stop.\"

Sheldon rose and made his way to the front of the bus. The driver nodded
to him as he stepped off, a gesture that might have been farewell or
might have been acknowledgment of the strangeness of the situation.
Sheldon nodded back and turned to face the village.

Masaki Village was exactly what its name implied: a village. Small and
rural, centered on a cluster of shops and houses that had probably
looked much the same for the past hundred years. The bus stop was a
weathered wooden shelter near a general store, and beyond it, a single
main street wound between buildings of wood and tile, their architecture
traditional, their paint faded by sun and time.

And everyone was staring at him.

The attention was immediate and unanimous. Conversations stopped
mid-sentence. Heads turned. A group of children playing in a yard froze
in place, their game forgotten. A man sweeping the steps of a shop
paused with his broom in mid-stroke. Even a cat, lounging in a patch of
sunlight, seemed to fix its gaze on this unexpected arrival.

Sheldon stood still for a moment, letting them look. Letting them
process. There was no point in pretending he was not conspicuous; better
to acknowledge it and move forward.

\"Hello,\" he said, addressing the general area with a polite bow. \"My
name is Tsukino Sheldon. I am looking for the Masaki Shrine. Can anyone
give me directions?\"

The stares shifted. Surprise layered over surprise. A foreigner who
spoke Japanese. Who spoke it well, without the halting cadence of a
phrase book or the heavy accent of someone who had learned from tapes.

The man with the broom recovered first.

\"The shrine? Yes, it is up the hill, past the lake. About three hundred
steps.\"

\"Three hundred steps?\"

\"It is quite a climb,\" the man said, a note of warning in his voice.
\"Especially in this heat.\"

\"I appreciate the warning.\" Sheldon offered a small smile. \"I could
use the exercise.\"

The man\'s expression softened slightly, some of the wariness fading. A
foreigner who spoke politely, who did not demand or assume, who
acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead. Perhaps not so strange
after all.

\"Follow the main road through the village,\" the man said, pointing.
\"You will see the path on your left, near the torii gate. The steps are
marked.\"

\"Thank you.\"

Sheldon walked through the village, feeling the weight of attention on
his back. Whispers followed him like a wake, too quiet to make out but
clearly about him. He let them wash over him and kept walking.

The village was small, perhaps two dozen buildings clustered around the
main road, with a few more scattered up the surrounding hillsides. A
general store, a vegetable stand, what might have been a small
restaurant or tea house. No gas station that he could see, no modern
conveniences. A place that time had touched lightly, preserving
something that the outside world had largely lost.

The torii gate appeared on his left, just as the shopkeeper had
described. Traditional vermillion, the paint faded but recently
maintained, framing the entrance to a path that disappeared into the
forest. Beyond the gate, stone steps were visible, worn smooth by
generations of feet, climbing upward into green shadow.

A wooden sign beside the gate read: Masaki Shrine. Visitors Welcome.

Sheldon paused at the gate, looking up at the path ahead. Three hundred
steps, the man had said. A significant climb. But his new body felt
ready for it, eager even, humming with that unfamiliar surplus of
energy.

He passed through the gate and began to climb.

The forest closed around him almost immediately.

The transition was surprisingly abrupt: one moment he could hear the
sounds of the village behind him, the voices and the movement and the
quiet rhythms of daily life, and the next he was surrounded by trees,
the air cooler and green-scented, the sounds of human activity fading
into silence.

The steps were old, carved from local stone, each one slightly different
in height and depth, worn into shallow curves by countless feet over
countless years. They climbed at a steady angle, switchbacking through
the forest, offering glimpses of the sky through gaps in the canopy.

Sheldon counted as he climbed. An old habit, something his grandmother
had taught him to keep his mind occupied during long walks. One, two,
three. Each step placed carefully, each breath measured, each heartbeat
tracked.

By step fifty, he had settled into a rhythm. His body moved easily, the
muscles in his legs working without complaint, his breath coming steady
and deep. The strange vitality he had noticed since waking continued to
serve him well, making the climb feel more like a gentle stroll than a
serious exertion.

By step one hundred, he began to notice the lake.

It appeared through gaps in the trees, glimpses of dark water visible
between the trunks. Large, larger than he had expected, stretching away
to the north like an inland sea. The surface was still, reflecting the
sky and the surrounding forest like a mirror, deep and dark and somehow
unsettling.

Something about the lake made his skin prickle.

He could not have explained the sensation if asked. It was not fear,
exactly, or even unease. More like awareness. The feeling of being
watched, of being noticed, of being in the presence of something that
warranted attention. His body responded to it instinctively, the hair on
his arms rising, a slight tension settling into his shoulders.

That flicker at the edge of his consciousness returned. The presence
that had spoken to him earlier, stirring in response to whatever he was
feeling.

*Energy concentration detected. Source: below. Exercise caution.*

Sheldon paused on the steps, frowning.

\"Energy concentration,\" he repeated under his breath. \"Below. What
does that mean? What kind of energy? Is it dangerous?\"

No response. The presence had delivered its cryptic warning and
retreated back into silence.

\"Helpful,\" Sheldon muttered. \"Very helpful. Warn me about something
and then refuse to explain what it is.\"

He filed the warning away and continued climbing, but he found his gaze
drawn to the lake more frequently now. Each glimpse through the trees
seemed to reveal more of its extent, more of its darkness, more of
whatever quality it possessed that made his body react.

By step two hundred, he was certain that something was down there.

He could not see it. Could not hear it. Could barely even feel it, just
that faint prickle of awareness, that sense of presence. But the
certainty was unshakeable. Beneath that dark, still surface, something
waited. Something old. Something powerful. Something that had been there
for a very long time and would be there for a very long time to come.

The memory he had been chasing stirred again, closer this time, almost
within reach.

*Masaki. Lake. Shrine. Something sealed. Something dangerous. A woman? A
demon? Something from space?*

The fragments refused to coalesce into coherent understanding. He knew
he had encountered this information before, in some other context, some
other life. But the details remained stubbornly out of reach, obscured
by two decades of not thinking about whatever it was.

By step three hundred, he reached the top.

The forest opened onto a cleared area, a plateau carved into the
mountainside and maintained with obvious care. The shrine complex spread
out before him, traditional architecture in weathered wood and aged
stone, buildings arranged in the classic pattern of torii gate,
purification fountain, main hall, subsidiary structures.

It was old. Genuinely old, in a way that Sheldon could feel as much as
see. The wood had silvered with age, the stone had worn smooth, the
tiles on the roofs showed the subtle variations of handmade
craftsmanship. This was not a reproduction or a restoration. This was
the real thing, a shrine that had stood on this spot for centuries,
maintained by generations of hands, witness to more history than any
single human life could encompass.

And there, to one side of the main complex, a house.

Traditional construction, wood and tile, with a wide engawa overlooking
the forest and, beyond it, the lake. The sliding doors were open to the
spring air, and on the engawa, an old man was sweeping.

He moved with a rhythm that seemed almost meditative, the broom
traveling across the wooden boards in slow, deliberate strokes. Gray
hair pulled back in a simple tie. Wire-rimmed glasses catching the
light. Simple clothes, worn but clean, the kind of clothes a man might
wear when he expected to do physical work.

Something about the way he moved made Sheldon pause.

It was too controlled. Too precise. The sweep of the broom was not just
cleaning; it was practice, each movement calibrated, each position held
for exactly the right duration. Sheldon had studied enough martial arts
to recognize the underlying pattern. This was not an old man doing
housework. This was a master performing a form, using the mundane task
to maintain skills that had been honed over a lifetime.

Or longer.

The thought arrived unbidden, connected to nothing he could articulate,
and he pushed it aside.

He approached the house, his footsteps deliberately audible on the stone
path. The old man did not look up, but something in his posture shifted,
a subtle acknowledgment of another presence.

Sheldon stopped at a respectful distance and bowed.

\"Good afternoon. My apologies for arriving unannounced. My name is
Tsukino Sheldon.\"

The old man completed one more sweep of the broom, then straightened and
turned.

Their eyes met.

Sheldon had spent his career reading people. Academic politics required
it: knowing when a colleague was genuinely interested in collaboration
versus looking for leverage, when a funding committee was receptive
versus skeptical, when a student was struggling versus merely lazy. He
had developed an instinct for the subtle cues that revealed what people
were thinking beneath their surface expressions.

The old man\'s eyes revealed nothing.

They were sharp, sharper than any seventy-year-old\'s eyes had a right
to be. They swept over Sheldon with the precision of a targeting system,
taking in everything: his foreign features, his expensive but
travel-worn clothes, the way he held himself, the watchfulness in his
own gaze. Sheldon had the uncomfortable sensation of being completely
and thoroughly assessed by someone who had been assessing people for
longer than seemed possible.

\"Welcome,\" the old man said. His voice was measured, calm, giving away
as little as his eyes. \"I am Masaki Katsuhito. This is my family\'s
shrine.\"

Masaki Katsuhito.

The name crashed through Sheldon\'s mind like a wave.

He knew this name. He was absolutely certain he knew this name. Not from
a passing reference, not from a casual encounter, but from something
significant. Something he had spent time with. Something that mattered.

*Katsuhito. The shrine. The lake. Space pirates. Princesses. Something
sealed. A show. An anime. I watched this. I watched this when I was\...*

The memory still would not fully surface. He could feel it there,
pressing against the walls of recollection, but something kept it
contained. Twenty-one years of not thinking about whatever this was had
buried it too deep for easy retrieval.

\"Thank you for the welcome,\" Sheldon said, keeping his voice steady
through an effort of will. \"I was told in the village that you
sometimes take in visitors. I am a researcher, currently on sabbatical.
I am looking for a quiet place to work.\" He paused, weighing how much
to offer. \"I can pay for lodging, or work for my keep. I have practical
skills. Carpentry, plumbing, electrical work. Cooking.\"

Katsuhito studied him for a long moment. The broom remained in his
hands, held with the casual precision of someone who could turn it into
a weapon if necessary.

\"You climbed all those steps,\" the old man observed. \"Not many
visitors bother these days.\"

\"I was told the shrine was worth seeing.\"

\"Were you.\" It was not quite a question. Those sharp eyes continued
their assessment. \"And what, exactly, do you research?\"

\"Theoretical physics. High-energy phenomena. Exotic propulsion
systems.\" Sheldon allowed a slight, self-deprecating smile. \"Mostly I
sit in rooms and argue with other scientists about equations.\"

\"Physics.\" Katsuhito tasted the word. Something shifted in his
expression, too subtle to read. \"And you came here, of all places. To
rural Okayama. For the mountain air?\"

\"Something like that.\"

The silence stretched between them. Sheldon kept his posture open, his
expression calm. He could wait. His grandmother had taught him patience,
if nothing else. When you want something from someone, she used to say,
give them space to decide. Pressure makes people stubborn.

Behind Katsuhito, one of the sliding doors opened.

A small figure appeared in the doorway.

It was a boy, perhaps five or six years old, with a shock of dark hair
and eyes that seemed too large for his face. He was clutching a stuffed
animal, something that might have been a rabbit once before years of
love had worn its features smooth. His feet were bare on the wooden
floor, and he stopped abruptly when he saw Sheldon, those big eyes going
even wider.

\"Grandpa.\" The boy did not quite hide behind the doorframe, but he did
not come any further forward either. \"There is a man.\"

\"Yes,\" Katsuhito said, and his voice was different now. Softer.
Warmer. The voice of a grandfather. \"This is Tsukino-san. He is
visiting.\"

\"Tsukino-san.\" The boy tested the sounds, his small face scrunched in
concentration. Then he looked at Sheldon with the unfiltered directness
of young children, studying him without any of the social filters that
adults learned to apply.

Sheldon waited. He had encountered this before, the moment when a child
first processed his appearance. The responses varied. Some children were
curious. Some were wary. Some asked questions that their parents found
mortifying. Some did not seem to notice anything unusual at all.

This boy fell into the curious category.

\"Your skin is different,\" the boy said thoughtfully.

\"It is,\" Sheldon agreed.

\"It is like chocolate.\" The boy\'s face lit up with the joy of having
found the right comparison. \"The really good kind. The kind Grandpa got
me for New Year\'s.\"

Sheldon blinked.

Then, despite everything that had happened, despite the impossibility of
his situation and the weight of forgotten memories and the lingering
echo of death, he laughed.

It came from somewhere deep in his chest, genuine and surprised, pulled
out of him by the pure innocence of the comparison. Of all the things.
Of all the ways a child could have described him. The good chocolate.
The special occasion chocolate. The kind you saved for celebrations.

\"That is probably the nicest way anyone has ever said that,\" he
managed.

The boy brightened at the laugh. Some of the shyness melted from his
posture. He stepped fully out of the doorway, still clutching his
rabbit, and studied Sheldon with renewed interest.

\"I am Tenchi,\" he announced. \"I live here with Grandpa. My mom
is\...\" He paused, and something flickered across his young face, a
shadow of loss that no child should have to carry. \"My mom is not here
anymore.\"

\"I am sorry to hear that,\" Sheldon said quietly.

\"It is okay.\" The words were automatic, clearly rehearsed, the kind of
response that adults had taught him to give. \"Grandpa takes care of me.
And Dad comes on the weekends.\"

\"Tenchi,\" Katsuhito said, and there was a gentle warning in his voice.
\"Perhaps you should let Tsukino-san rest from his climb before you
interrogate him.\"

\"I was not interrogating!\" The boy looked genuinely offended. \"I was
being polite. You said I should be polite to visitors.\"

\"And you are being very polite. But visitors also need water and a
place to sit after climbing three hundred steps.\"

Tenchi considered this logic, found it acceptable, and nodded firmly.

\"You should come inside,\" he told Sheldon, as though the decision had
been his all along. \"I will get you water. And you can see my room. I
have a beetle in a jar.\"

He turned and disappeared back into the house, presumably to prepare for
the guest he had just unilaterally accepted.

Katsuhito watched him go, and for just a moment, his expression softened
into something that looked almost like tenderness. Then the mask
returned, and he turned back to Sheldon.

\"It seems you have been invited,\" the old man said. His tone was
neutral, giving nothing away. \"I would not want to disappoint my
grandson.\"

\"Is that a yes?\"

\"It is tea. We will see about the rest.\"

He set aside the broom and gestured toward the door that Tenchi had left
open.

Sheldon followed him inside, aware that he was being granted an audience
rather than acceptance.

The interior of the house was exactly what the exterior had suggested:
traditional, well-maintained, and old in a way that spoke of generations
rather than mere decades.

Tatami floors, their woven surfaces firm but yielding underfoot. Sliding
paper screens, some open to the spring air, others closed to divide the
space into rooms. Wooden beams overhead, darkened by years of smoke from
cooking fires, their surfaces worn smooth by hands that had steadied
against them over countless lifetimes. The smell of the place was
complex and layered: old wood, fresh tatami, incense from the shrine,
something floral that might have been cleaning solution or might have
been simply the mountain air.

Sheldon removed his shoes at the entrance, a habit that came
automatically from his years of interacting with Japanese colleagues,
and stepped up onto the raised floor. The tatami gave slightly beneath
his weight, a sensation that was unfamiliar but not unpleasant.

Katsuhito led him through a hallway lined with closed screens, past
doorways that offered glimpses into other rooms. A kitchen, its surfaces
cluttered with the evidence of recent use. A storage area, boxes and
baskets arranged with careful precision. What might have been a study or
meditation room, a low table visible through a partially open door.

Throughout it all, Sheldon noticed the signs of strain.

Not neglect, exactly. The house was clean, the floors swept, the
surfaces dusted. But there were small indicators of deferred
maintenance, the kind of things that accumulated when there were not
enough hands or hours to address them all. A loose board near the
entrance that creaked under his weight. Water stains in one corner of
the ceiling, evidence of a leak that had been contained but not fully
repaired. Dust in the corners of the less-used rooms, accumulating
faster than one person could manage.

This was a house being kept up by too few people. The shrine, from what
he had seen outside, was probably the same. Adequate but stretched thin,
the work of maintenance exceeding the capacity of those responsible for
it.

He filed these observations away, adding them to his growing
understanding of the situation.

The main room was larger than the others, its windows facing west toward
a view of the forest and, beyond it, the lake. The water was fully
visible from here, spread out like a dark mirror, its surface so still
that it perfectly reflected the sky and the surrounding trees.

Sheldon found himself staring at it. The prickle of awareness he had
felt during the climb was stronger here, a constant low-level pressure
against his senses. The lake seemed to stare back at him, patient and
vast, holding whatever it held in perfect silence.

\"The view is the best feature of the house,\" Katsuhito said, watching
Sheldon watch the lake. \"Some find it peaceful.\"

\"It is beautiful,\" Sheldon said, which was true. He kept the rest to
himself.

Katsuhito\'s expression remained unreadable. He gestured toward a
cushion beside the low table that dominated the center of the room.

\"Please, sit. I will prepare tea.\"

Sheldon settled onto the cushion, folding his legs beneath him in a
position that should have been uncomfortable but somehow was not. His
new body adapted easily, flexibility he had not possessed in years
making the posture feel natural.

Through the window, the lake continued its silent vigil.

Tenchi appeared in the doorway, a glass of water clutched carefully in
both hands, his small face focused on the critical task of not spilling.
He crossed the room with the exaggerated care of a child carrying
something precious and presented the glass to Sheldon with evident
pride.

\"Here. Grandpa says you have to have water before tea because climbing
makes you thirsty.\"

\"Thank you.\" Sheldon accepted the glass and drank. The water was cool
and clean, tasting faintly of minerals, probably from a well or mountain
spring. \"That is exactly what I needed.\"

Tenchi beamed. His rabbit was tucked under one arm, its worn face
pressed against his ribs, a silent companion to all his activities.

\"Do you want to see my beetle? I found it yesterday. It has green parts
that shine when the light hits them.\"

\"Maybe after tea,\" Sheldon said. \"Your grandfather wanted to talk to
me about something first.\"

\"Oh.\" The boy nodded sagely, as though he understood the weight of
adult conversations. \"Business.\"

\"Something like that.\"

\"Okay. I will wait.\" Tenchi settled onto another cushion, not quite
next to Sheldon but clearly oriented toward him, his attention fixed on
this fascinating visitor. \"But you have to promise to see the beetle
after. It is really interesting.\"

\"I promise.\"

Katsuhito returned with a tea tray, moving with the same precise economy
that characterized all his actions. He set the tray on the table and
began the process of preparation: warming the cups, measuring the
leaves, pouring the water at exactly the right temperature. The ritual
was familiar to Sheldon from countless academic meetings and conference
receptions, but Katsuhito performed it with a depth of attention that
elevated it beyond mere convention.

Tea was poured, served, accepted. Sheldon held the cup in both hands,
feeling its warmth, inhaling the subtle fragrance of good green tea. He
waited for Katsuhito to take the first sip before drinking himself,
observing the protocols.

The tea was excellent. Far better than the conference tea he was used
to, with a depth and complexity that suggested careful cultivation and
expert preparation. He said so, and Katsuhito acknowledged the
compliment with a slight inclination of his head.

\"You mentioned practical skills,\" the old man said. His tone was
businesslike, nothing more. \"What exactly can you do?\"

\"Carpentry, both rough and finish. Basic plumbing. Some electrical
work, though I would need to understand how it differs here. Roofing.
Painting. General repairs.\" Sheldon met the old man\'s eyes. \"I
noticed a few things on my way in. The loose board near the entrance.
The water stains on the ceiling. The gutter section that has pulled away
from the eave.\"

Katsuhito\'s expression remained neutral, but something flickered in his
eyes. Sheldon could not tell if it was approval or wariness.

\"You have sharp eyes.\"

\"I was trained to notice things. It is part of my work.\"

\"Physics requires observing loose boards?\"

\"Physics requires noticing when something is not as it should be. The
skill transfers.\"

Silence. Katsuhito sipped his tea. Sheldon waited.

\"The faucet in the kitchen has been dripping for three weeks,\" the old
man said finally. \"The washers are worn. I have been meaning to fix it,
but there is always something else that needs attention first.\"

It was a test. Sheldon recognized it immediately. A small task, low
stakes, something that would demonstrate competence without committing
to anything.

\"May I look at it?\"

\"Please.\"

The kitchen was compact but well-equipped, its surfaces cluttered with
the evidence of meals prepared and cleaned up without enough time
between to properly organize. The faucet was mounted above a deep
ceramic sink, its brass finish dulled by years of use. As Sheldon
approached, he could hear the problem: a steady drip, drip, drip of
water falling into the basin, the rhythm of a seal that had given up
trying to hold.

He examined the faucet without touching it, assessing the design, the
age, the likely cause of the failure. Traditional construction, similar
to what he knew but with small differences that reflected Japanese
manufacturing preferences. The handles were stiff, suggesting mineral
buildup in addition to worn washers. The aerator probably needed
cleaning too.

He reached into his pocket for tools and found them waiting for him.

A small kit, compact and complete, exactly the kind of thing he would
have chosen for himself. Wrenches in various sizes, screwdrivers,
pliers, a selection of washers and O-rings sorted by dimension. It had
not been there when he checked his pockets earlier. He was certain of
that. It had simply appeared when he needed it.

Sheldon stared at the toolkit for a long moment.

*Resources available,* the presence in his head had said. Perhaps this
was what it meant.

He did not question it. There was no point in questioning it. The
toolkit was real, the faucet needed fixing, and standing around
wondering about impossible things would not accomplish anything useful.

He set to work.

Tenchi appeared in the doorway almost immediately, drawn by the sound of
activity. He watched with wide eyes as Sheldon shut off the water
supply, disassembled the faucet handles, and laid out the internal
components on a clean cloth.

\"What are you doing?\"

\"Fixing the drip.\" Sheldon held up the old washer, showing the boy the
cracks and discoloration that had caused it to fail. \"See this? This is
what makes the seal when you turn the water off. It is rubber, and over
time, it gets hard and brittle. Then it cannot squish into the right
shape anymore, and water gets through.\"

Tenchi leaned closer, studying the damaged part with intense
concentration.

\"So you put in a new one?\"

\"Exactly.\" Sheldon selected a replacement washer from his kit,
checking the size against the old one. \"The new one is soft and
flexible. It will make a good seal for years.\"

\"How did you know that was what was wrong?\"

\"The sound.\" Sheldon began reassembling the faucet, his hands moving
with practiced ease. \"Dripping faucets almost always mean worn washers.
The faucet was telling us what it needed.\"

Tenchi considered this.

\"Faucets can talk?\"

\"Not with words. But everything has a kind of life.\" The phrase came
naturally, something his grandmother might have said, though he could
not remember her ever saying it in quite this way. \"Things want to work
the way they are supposed to. When they cannot, they let you know. You
just have to learn their language.\"

The boy\'s expression shifted, something deep and complicated moving
behind his eyes.

\"My mom used to say things like that.\"

Sheldon\'s hands paused on the faucet.

\"Did she?\"

\"She said everything has a spirit. That we have to take care of things
because they take care of us.\" Tenchi\'s voice was quiet, reflective.
\"Grandpa does not talk like that. He just says what needs to be done.\"

\"Different people express the same ideas in different ways,\" Sheldon
said carefully. \"Your grandfather takes care of the shrine because he
respects it. That is his way.\"

Tenchi thought about this for a while. Then he nodded, apparently
satisfied with the explanation.

\"Can you teach me?\" he asked. \"The language of things?\"

Sheldon looked at this small boy. Five or six years old, recently
motherless, reaching for something solid to hold onto in a world that
had shown him how quickly solid things could disappear. He did not know
what role he was supposed to play here, what purpose his presence was
meant to serve, what strange machinations had placed him in this house
at this time.

But he knew how to answer this question.

\"If your grandfather says it is okay,\" he said. \"And if I am here
long enough.\"

The faucet was fixed twenty minutes later. Sheldon turned the water back
on, tested both handles, confirmed that the drip had been eliminated.
Tenchi watched the entire process with the intensity of a graduate
student observing a critical experiment.

\"It stopped,\" the boy observed, unnecessary but triumphant.

\"It stopped.\"

\"Because you listened to what it needed.\"

\"That is right.\"

Tenchi grinned, a full-face expression of satisfaction that seemed to
use muscles most adults had forgotten existed. Then he grabbed
Sheldon\'s hand and tugged.

\"Now you have to see my beetle. I promised.\"

\"You promised,\" Sheldon agreed, and let himself be led away.

The beetle was, as advertised, interesting.

It was some kind of jewel beetle, its carapace shimmering with
iridescent greens and golds when the light hit it at certain angles.
Tenchi had captured it in a glass jar with holes punched in the lid, and
he presented it to Sheldon with the pride of a scientist displaying a
significant discovery.

\"I found it on the maple tree by the shrine,\" he explained. \"Grandpa
says they are not rare, but I think this one is special. See how bright
the colors are?\"

Sheldon examined the beetle with appropriate solemnity, turning the jar
in his hands to catch the light.

\"The colors come from the structure of its shell,\" he said. \"Not from
pigment, like paint, but from the way the layers of the shell interact
with light. It is called iridescence.\"

\"Ir-i-des-cence.\" Tenchi sounded out the word carefully. \"That is a
big word.\"

\"It is. But big words are just ways of describing things precisely.
Once you know what they mean, they become useful.\"

\"What else can you tell me about it?\"

Sheldon did not know much about Japanese beetles specifically, but he
knew enough general biology to offer some observations, and Tenchi
absorbed every word with the attention of someone genuinely interested
in understanding. The afternoon stretched into evening as they examined
the beetle, discussed its probable diet and habits, and eventually
released it back onto the maple tree where it had been found.

Tenchi insisted on a small ceremony for the release, a thank-you to the
beetle for letting them observe it. Sheldon participated without
comment, recognizing the echo of his earlier words about everything
having a kind of life.

Dinner was prepared by Katsuhito, who had watched the faucet repair from
the doorway without comment and then retreated to the kitchen. The meal
was simple: rice, grilled fish, pickled vegetables, miso soup. Sheldon
ate what was offered and did not presume to help, sensing that the
kitchen was Katsuhito\'s domain and he had not yet been invited into it.

Tenchi carried most of the conversation, a running commentary on his
day, his beetle, his observations about the world. Katsuhito listened
with patient attention, occasionally redirecting or correcting, but
mostly allowing the boy to talk. Sheldon listened too, learning the
rhythms of this household, the spaces between words, the things that
were said and the things that were left unspoken.

After dinner, Katsuhito told Tenchi it was time for bed. The boy
protested, as children did, but eventually submitted to the inevitable.
He paused at the doorway and looked back at Sheldon.

\"Will you still be here tomorrow?\"

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito. The old man\'s expression gave nothing
away.

\"I do not know yet,\" Sheldon said honestly. \"That is up to your
grandfather.\"

Tenchi turned to Katsuhito with the full force of a child\'s hopeful
expectation.

\"Grandpa?\"

The silence stretched. Katsuhito looked at his grandson, then at
Sheldon, then back at the boy.

\"We will see,\" he said finally. \"Now. Bed.\"

Tenchi went, clearly unsatisfied but unwilling to push further. His
footsteps retreated down the hallway, followed by the sound of a door
sliding closed.

Sheldon and Katsuhito sat in silence.

The old man rose and began collecting the dishes, his movements
unhurried. Sheldon stood to help, but Katsuhito waved him off.

\"The engawa,\" he said. \"Wait there. I will join you when I am
finished.\"

Sheldon went outside.

The night had fallen fully, the sky above alive with stars, the lake a
darker darkness below. The air was cool but not cold, carrying the
sounds of insects and frogs. He settled onto the engawa, letting his
legs hang over the edge, and waited.

The lake drew his attention, even in darkness.

He could not see it, but he could feel it. That presence, that weight,
that sense of something vast and patient waiting beneath the water. The
prickle of awareness that had followed him since he first glimpsed the
water through the trees on his climb.

Was it real? Was he actually sensing something, or was his overloaded
mind manufacturing patterns from nothing? The system—whatever it was—had
gone silent after providing his location and the date. No menu appeared
when he tried to summon one. No interface responded to his mental
commands. Just that single burst of information on arrival, and then
nothing.

Maybe the sensing was another passive gift. Enhanced perception that
worked without his conscious direction. Or maybe he was just tired and
overwhelmed, projecting significance onto a body of water because his
fragmentary memories suggested there should be something there.

*Masaki. Lake. Shrine. Something sealed. Something dangerous.*

The memories stirred but refused to surface. He had watched something,
once. Read something, maybe. A show or a manga or a light novel, back
when he was younger and consumed such things without paying close
attention. The names felt familiar in a way that nagged at him, like a
word on the tip of his tongue that refused to form.

Whatever was down there—if anything was down there at all—it was not his
immediate concern. He had more pressing matters: establishing himself,
proving useful, understanding this new existence. The lake could wait.
It had apparently been waiting for a very long time already.

But he filed the feeling away. Noted the prickle of awareness, the sense
of depth and patience, the way his attention kept drifting toward that
dark water even when he tried to focus elsewhere. If his body was
telling him something, he would be foolish to ignore it entirely.

He just did not know what it was telling him. Not yet.

The frustration was immense. Somewhere in his memories, buried under two
decades of not caring, were the details that could tell him what to
expect. The names of threats. The nature of powers. The shape of the
story that was apparently now his life. If he could just remember, if he
could just access what his teenage self had watched without paying
attention, he would know what was coming.

But the memories would not surface. They remained locked away, fragments
without context, names without meanings, the useless remnants of
entertainment consumed and discarded.

He was standing in the opening chapter of a story he had forgotten,
surrounded by characters he should know, facing dangers he could not
anticipate.

It was terrifying.

It was also, in a strange way, clarifying.

He could not change what he did not remember. He could not prepare for
specifics he could not access. But he could do what he had always done:
observe, analyze, adapt. He could learn this world and these people. He
could build skills and relationships and understanding. He could make
himself useful, make himself part of this household, make himself
someone worth trusting.

And maybe, in time, the memories would surface. Or the truth would
reveal itself through other means. Or he would figure it out through the
same methods that had carried him through every other challenge in his
life: patience, attention, and the willingness to work harder than
anyone expected.

Twelve years was a long time. A lot could happen in twelve years.

The door behind him slid open.

Katsuhito stepped onto the engawa, a cup in each hand. He crossed to
where Sheldon sat and lowered himself carefully, his joints moving
stiffly, his movements those of an old man at the end of a long day.

He handed one cup to Sheldon. Tea, still warm.

They sat in silence for a while, drinking, watching the darkness.

\"The faucet works,\" Katsuhito said eventually.

\"It does.\"

\"Tenchi likes you.\"

\"He is a good kid.\"

More silence. The old man\'s profile was barely visible in the
starlight, his expression impossible to read.

\"There is a room,\" Katsuhito said finally. \"Storage, mostly. But there
is space for a futon. It is not comfortable, but it is dry.\" A pause.
\"You may use it. For now. In exchange for work.\"

Sheldon waited. There was more coming.

\"This is not an open-ended invitation. It is a trial. I do not know
you. I do not know why you are here or what you want. I have a grandson
to protect, and I will not allow anyone to harm him.\"

\"I understand.\"

\"Do you.\" It was not quite a question. \"We will see.\"

The terms were clear: work for room and board, nothing more. No promises
of acceptance. No offer of belonging. Just a practical arrangement,
subject to change at any time.

It was more than Sheldon had expected. Less than he might have hoped.
But it was a start.

\"Thank you,\" he said. \"I will do my best to be useful.\"

\"See that you do.\"

Katsuhito finished his tea and rose.

\"The room is the third door on the left. There are linens in the
closet. Breakfast is at seven.\" He paused at the door. \"Good night,
Tsukino-san.\"

\"Good night, Katsuhito-san.\"

The door slid closed. Sheldon was alone with the darkness and the lake
and the patient weight of things he did not understand.

He sat for a while longer, watching the stars wheel slowly overhead,
listening to the night sounds, feeling that strange awareness of the
lake below—if it was real awareness at all, and not simply exhaustion
playing tricks.

Tomorrow he would begin his trial. Whatever Katsuhito expected of him,
whatever tests lay ahead, he would face them as he had faced every
challenge in his life: with patience, with attention, with work.

And if there was something in that lake—something ancient, something
waiting—he would learn about it in time. He would learn about all of it.
The old man. The boy. The shrine and its secrets. The system that had
brought him here and then gone silent.

Twelve years until Tenchi came of age. Twelve years to prepare, to
learn, to become whatever this world needed him to be.

He did not know what was coming. But he would be ready for it.

He went inside, found his room, and lay down on the futon that had been
prepared for him.

Sleep came slowly, his mind too full for easy rest. But eventually,
exhaustion won out over uncertainty, and he drifted into dreams.

In his dreams, there was light. Soft and warm and impossibly gentle,
like being held by hands he could not see. A voice he could almost hear,
saying words he could almost understand.

And beneath it all, the sense that he was not alone. That whatever had
caught him as he fell was still there, watching over him, waiting for
him to be ready for whatever came next.

He woke with the first light of dawn, the dream already fading, leaving
nothing behind but warmth.

His second day began.

⁂

## Day 2

---

## Tuesday, April 4, 1989

---

Sheldon woke to the sound of birds.

Not the alarm he was used to, the sharp electronic tone that had pulled him from sleep every morning in Fairbanks. Not the rumble of trucks on the road outside his apartment, or the clatter of the heating system cycling on against the cold. Just birds, their songs layered and complex, filtering through the paper screens that separated his room from the outside world.

He lay still for a long moment, his eyes closed, his mind slowly reassembling the pieces of where he was and how he had gotten there.

The futon beneath him was firm but comfortable, the kind of support that Western mattresses rarely achieved. The pillow under his head was filled with something that rustled faintly when he moved—buckwheat hulls, perhaps—conforming to the shape of his skull in a way that felt both foreign and correct. A light blanket covered him, cotton or linen, smooth against his skin.

He was in Japan. In 1989. In a shrine on a mountain above a village. In a house where an old man and a young boy were trying to rebuild their lives after loss.

He was alive, when he should not be alive. He was here, when he should not be anywhere.

The memories of the previous day returned in sequence. The field. The walk. The village with its curious faces. The three hundred steps. Katsuhito with his sharp eyes and his broom that moved like a weapon. Tenchi with his chocolate comparison and his stuffed rabbit and his quiet grief. The faucet. The beetle. The offer of a room.

Not acceptance. Not welcome. Just a trial. A chance to prove himself useful.

Sheldon opened his eyes.

The room was eight tatami mats of careful neutrality. The walls were covered in pale paper that glowed faintly with the early morning light. A single window, screened with translucent shoji, admitted a soft illumination that made everything look slightly dreamlike. His clothes from yesterday were folded neatly on a low chest near the door—he did not remember folding them that carefully, which meant someone had come in while he slept, or he had been more thorough in his exhaustion than he realized.

This had been someone's room before it was his.

He had not asked, the night before. Had not wanted to pry into the household's grief. But looking at the space now, at the careful emptiness of it, he could see the absence. Someone had removed personal items, had stripped away the evidence of previous occupation, had prepared this room for a guest while still holding the memory of who had lived here before.

The built-in shelves on the wall still held the dust-shadows of objects. Rectangular outlines where books or photos had rested. A circular mark where something—a vase? a clock?—had sat for years, preventing the dust from settling evenly. The physical memory of a life, erased but not forgotten.

Kiyone. Katsuhito's daughter. Tenchi's mother. The woman who had died—how long ago? Tenchi had said "not here anymore" with the weight of someone still learning what that meant.

This had been her room.

Sheldon sat up slowly, the blanket pooling around his waist. His body moved with that same unsettling ease he had noticed the day before. No stiffness from sleeping on an unfamiliar surface. No protest from muscles asked to hold new positions. He felt rested in a way he had not felt rested in years, as though eight hours of sleep had actually accomplished what eight hours of sleep was supposed to accomplish.

The light through the window was soft and golden, the quality of early morning before the sun had fully risen. He had woken with the dawn, his body apparently recalibrating to a schedule that matched this new world rather than the one he had left behind.

He pushed back the blanket and stood.

The tatami was cool beneath his bare feet, its woven surface firm and slightly rough. He crossed to the window and slid the screen aside, letting the morning flood in.

The view took his breath away.

The room faced east, away from the village, toward the rising sun. The sky was painted in gradients of gold and pink and pale blue, the colors shifting even as he watched, the light strengthening moment by moment. Below the window, the forest dropped away in layers of green, trees rising from the mountainside in dense profusion, their leaves catching the early light and turning it into something precious. In the distance, more mountains, their peaks emerging from morning mist like islands in a sea of cloud.

Birds moved through the canopy, their songs the same chorus that had woken him. He could see them now, small shapes flitting between branches, going about the business of their lives with no awareness of the strange visitor watching from above.

Sheldon stood at the window and breathed and tried to accept that this was real.

He had spent his career studying the impossible. Theoretical physics was, in many ways, the science of things that should not be: particles that existed in multiple states simultaneously, forces that operated across distances that should have precluded any connection, mathematics that described realities no human sense could directly perceive. He had learned to hold impossible ideas in his mind, to work with them, to treat them as tools rather than obstacles.

But this was different. This was not a thought experiment or a mathematical model. This was his life, transformed beyond recognition, operating under rules he did not understand.

He was not sure he would ever fully accept it. But he could function within it. He could observe and learn and adapt. He could do what needed to be done.

*When things go wrong, you stop, you breathe, you think. Then you act.*

He had done the first three yesterday. Today, he would do the fourth.

Starting with getting dressed.

---

The clothes from yesterday were wrinkled from travel, not suitable for another day of wear. He opened the closet and found what he had hoped to find: more clothes, simple and practical, in sizes that fit his compact frame. Someone had prepared this, had anticipated his needs, had stocked this room with everything a guest might require.

The same someone who had arranged the property deed and the bank accounts and the passport. The same someone who had known he was coming before he knew himself.

He pushed the thought aside and focused on the immediate task.

The clothes were traditional in style: a simple cotton undergarment, loose pants that tied at the waist, a short jacket that buttoned up the front. Work clothes, essentially, the kind of thing a laborer or farmer might wear. Not fashionable, but practical and comfortable.

He dressed carefully, taking his time with the unfamiliar fastenings, making sure everything sat correctly. The fabric felt good against his skin, soft from many washings, breathing easily in the morning warmth.

The door to his room slid open onto a hallway he remembered from the night before. Pale wooden floors, paper screens on both sides, the smell of old wood and incense and something else—something that might have been breakfast cooking in the kitchen.

Sheldon followed the smell.

---

The bathroom was a small room off the main hallway, equipped with a toilet and a sink and a wooden tub that looked like it was used for soaking rather than washing. A separate area, barely large enough to stand in, held a showerhead mounted on the wall and a low stool where one could sit while bathing.

Sheldon had read about this. Japanese bathing customs were different from American ones—you washed outside the tub, then soaked in the clean water. The tub was often shared by the whole household, which meant cleanliness before entering was not optional.

The fixtures were old but well-maintained, the same pattern he had observed throughout the house. Someone had taken good care of this place for many years, had repaired and cleaned and preserved until the evidence of age became indistinguishable from the evidence of love.

He used the toilet, washed his hands and face at the sink, and examined his reflection in the small mirror mounted above it.

The face that looked back at him was his own, but not quite.

The skin was the same warm brown it had always been, the tone his grandmother had called "good Georgia clay"—rich and even, with undertones that shifted depending on the light. But it was clearer now, smoother, the small imperfections of decades erased as though they had never been. No trace of the stress acne that had plagued him through graduate school. No sign of the dry patches that Alaska winters had carved into his cheeks. Just clear, healthy skin stretched over bones he was still learning to recognize as his.

His hair was shorter than he usually kept it, a clean fade that someone—the system? whatever had rebuilt his body?—had apparently decided was appropriate. The texture was the same as always: tight 4B coils that his grandmother had taught him to care for, that she had oiled and picked and shaped with patient hands every Sunday morning of his childhood. Dark brown, almost black, with those faint rust undertones that only appeared in strong light.

He touched it, feeling the familiar density, the way the coils sprang back against his fingers. This, at least, was unchanged. This, at least, was still his.

The face beneath the hair was younger than it should be. The lines around his eyes were softer. The creases that had begun to form at the corners of his mouth were absent entirely. His cheeks were fuller, rounder, the hollows that exhaustion and grief had carved into them during the last years of his grandmother's life simply gone. His jawline was defined but not sharp, the angles of youth rather than the edges of middle age.

His eyes were the same dark brown they had always been, soft and observant, the eyes his grandmother had said could see straight through to the truth of things. But something in them had changed. Something that might have been wonder, or might have been fear, or might have been simply the disorientation of seeing a face that was not quite the one he expected.

He studied himself for a long moment, cataloging the differences, trying to reconcile this reflection with his internal sense of who he was.

The man in the mirror was perhaps twenty-two. Maybe twenty-three. The age Sheldon had been when he finished his first doctorate, when he was still young enough to believe that hard work and intelligence were enough to solve any problem. Before the disappointments and compromises of academic life had taught him otherwise. Before he had learned that the world did not always reward merit, that politics and connections mattered as much as brilliance, that being the smartest person in the room was not always an advantage.

He remembered this face. Remembered seeing it in the tiny bathroom mirror of his graduate student apartment, remembered the hope in those eyes, the certainty that the future would be better than the past. That young man had believed that hard work would be enough. That the universe was fundamentally knowable if you just looked at it the right way. That being Black and small and brilliant in a world that often dismissed all three was a challenge to be overcome rather than a permanent condition to be navigated.

That young man had been wrong about a lot of things. But he had also been right about some things. And looking at his face now, Sheldon found himself wondering if he could borrow some of that hope, that certainty, that stubborn refusal to accept that the odds were against him.

Twenty-three. That was what his passport claimed. That was what this face suggested.

He had fifteen years of memories that this face had never earned.

Sheldon splashed more water on his cheeks, dried them with a small towel hanging beside the sink, and went to find breakfast.

---

The kitchen was already occupied.

Katsuhito stood at the stove, moving between pots and pans with a precise economy that characterized all his actions. The smell that filled the room was complex: rice cooking, miso heating, fish grilling somewhere out of sight. The old man was dressed in clothes similar to Sheldon's, simple and practical, his gray hair pulled back in its customary tie. He did not turn when Sheldon entered, but something in his posture shifted—an acknowledgment that was not quite welcome.

"Good morning," Sheldon said. "Can I help?"

"The rice is nearly done. The fish needs to be turned in two minutes. The pickles are in the container on the counter." Katsuhito still did not turn. "You are up early."

"I woke with the dawn. I think my body is still adjusting."

"Mm."

The response was noncommittal, neither encouraging nor discouraging. Sheldon moved to the counter and found the container of pickles, small cucumbers in a sharp brine that made his mouth water. He arranged them on a serving plate, trying to match the aesthetic he had observed in Japanese restaurants, the careful placement that turned food into art.

The kitchen was small but efficient, every tool and ingredient within easy reach of whoever stood at the stove. The faucet he had fixed the day before stood silent, no drip, the repair holding. Someone had wiped down the counters recently, but the accumulated evidence of daily cooking still showed in small ways: a splash of oil on the wall behind the stove, a worn spot on the floor where feet had stood for countless hours, the particular arrangement of spices and seasonings that spoke of habits built over years.

Sheldon watched Katsuhito cook and learned.

The old man moved with an efficiency that seemed almost supernatural. No wasted motion. No hesitation. Every reach and stir and adjustment perfectly calibrated, as though he had performed these exact actions thousands of times and knew them the way a musician knew a piece of music. The fish turned at precisely the right moment. The rice was removed from heat at precisely the right stage of doneness. The miso soup, simmering in a small pot, was seasoned with a single confident shake of a container.

This was mastery. Not the kind that came from following recipes, but the kind that came from understanding principles so deeply that the specific applications became intuitive.

Sheldon had seen this before, in the best of his colleagues. The physicists who could look at an equation and see not just the mathematics but the physical reality it described. The engineers who could diagnose a problem by the sound of a machine. The teachers who could explain complex ideas in simple terms because they understood them at a level beyond words.

Katsuhito cooked the way those people worked. With the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime, compressed into every small action.

A running sound in the hallway broke his contemplation. Small feet, moving fast, accompanied by the particular quality of energy that only children possessed.

Tenchi burst into the kitchen like a small explosion.

"Chocolate-san!"

The boy was still in his sleeping clothes, his hair sticking up in several directions, his stuffed rabbit clutched under one arm. His face was bright with the uncomplicated joy of a child who had woken to discover that something good was still true.

"Good morning, Tenchi," Sheldon said, smiling despite himself at the nickname.

"You are still here!" The boy stopped in the middle of the kitchen, as though he had expected Sheldon to have vanished overnight. "I thought maybe I dreamed you."

"I am still here."

"Good." Tenchi nodded firmly, the matter settled. Then he noticed the activity at the stove and his attention shifted. "Is breakfast ready? I am hungry. I am always hungry in the morning. Grandpa says I eat like a bear coming out of hibernation."

"Breakfast will be ready when you are dressed," Katsuhito said without turning. "Go. Wash your face. Brush your teeth. Put on clothes that are not pajamas."

"But I am hungry *now*."

"Hunger is a good teacher. It will teach you to dress faster."

Tenchi made a sound that was half groan and half laugh, the complaint of a child who knew he would not win but felt obligated to register his protest anyway. He shot Sheldon a look of shared suffering, as though they were allies against the unreasonable demands of the adult world, and then ran back out of the kitchen.

His footsteps retreated down the hallway, followed by the sound of a door sliding open and closed.

"He is energetic in the mornings," Sheldon observed.

"He is energetic at all times."

That was all. No elaboration. No warmth. Just a statement of fact.

They finished preparing breakfast in silence. Sheldon set the table while Katsuhito arranged the serving dishes, and by the time Tenchi returned—dressed and marginally more presentable—everything was ready.

---

The meal was simple and perfect.

Rice, fluffy and slightly sweet. Fish, grilled until the skin crisped and the flesh flaked at the touch of chopsticks. Pickles, sharp and refreshing. Miso soup, its warmth spreading through Sheldon's chest with every sip. A small side of cooked vegetables, seasoned with something that might have been sesame.

Tenchi ate with the single-minded focus of a child who had been promised food and was now collecting on that promise. His chopsticks moved between dishes with practiced ease, selecting bites, transferring them to his mouth, returning for more. He did not speak while he ate, his attention fully occupied by the task.

Sheldon ate more slowly, savoring each element, trying to learn the flavors and textures of this cuisine that would now be his daily sustenance. He had eaten Japanese food before, in restaurants and at conference dinners, but this was different. This was home cooking, made with care and experience, carrying the particular signature of the person who had made it.

Katsuhito ate with the measured pace of someone who had learned that food was fuel and should be consumed efficiently but not rushed. His attention seemed divided between his meal and his two companions, his eyes occasionally flickering to Sheldon in a way that felt like assessment.

Sheldon noticed. He was meant to notice, he suspected.

When the meal was finished, Tenchi pushed back from the table and announced his plans for the morning.

"I am going to show Kabutaro the big tree! He has not seen it yet. He only saw my room and the kitchen."

"Kabutaro might prefer to stay in his jar," Katsuhito said mildly. "Beetles do not always appreciate sightseeing."

"But the big tree is special! Everyone should see the big tree." Tenchi's logic was unassailable in its simplicity. "Even beetles."

He ran off before anyone could argue further, his footsteps fading toward his room where the beetle presumably waited.

"I will clean up," Sheldon said, rising to collect the dishes.

"Thank you." Katsuhito remained seated, his hands wrapped around his tea cup. "When you are finished, there is a list in the workshop. Tasks that need attention. You may address them as you see fit."

"And this afternoon?"

"This afternoon is yours. You mentioned business in the village. Property to settle." The old man's eyes met his. "The shrine does not require your constant presence. Only your reliable return."

It was permission and test wrapped together. Freedom to leave, with the expectation that he would come back.

"I will return before dinner," Sheldon said.

"That would be acceptable."

Sheldon carried the dishes to the kitchen and began washing.

---

The morning work went quickly.

Sheldon found the list in the workshop and assessed each task with a practiced eye. Some were simple: a loose hinge, a stuck drawer, weatherstripping that had begun to peel away from a window frame. Others were more complex: a section of fence that had begun to lean, a leak in the storage building roof, a door that no longer closed properly due to settling in the frame.

He prioritized by severity and started with the roof leak. Water damage was insidious—left unaddressed, it would spread, rotting wood and encouraging mold until the repair cost multiplied beyond reason. Better to catch it now, while the problem was still contained.

The storage building was small, perhaps four tatami mats in floor area, used to hold tools and supplies that did not need to be in the main workshop. The leak had started in one corner, where wind-driven rain had found a gap between tiles and worked its way through the underlying structure.

He climbed onto the roof carefully, testing each foothold before committing his weight. The tiles were old—hand-made, judging by their slight irregularities—and some had shifted over the decades, creating gaps where water could penetrate. He repositioned the displaced tiles, sealed the gaps with material he found in the workshop, and checked the surrounding area for other potential failure points.

The view from the roof was remarkable. He could see the whole shrine complex laid out below him: the main hall with its sweeping roof, the house where he slept, the torii gate at the top of the stairs. The great tree dominated the landscape, its canopy spreading wide enough to shade half the courtyard. Beyond the shrine, the forest stretched in every direction, broken only by the narrow path of the stairs descending toward the village.

He could see the lake from here too, a silver mirror reflecting the morning sky. Beautiful. Peaceful. Just a lake.

The work was familiar in its rhythms. Assess the damage. Identify the cause. Develop a solution. Execute with care. His hands knew what to do even when his mind wandered to other concerns.

He thought about his grandmother as he worked. About the way she had taught him to approach problems, breaking them down into manageable pieces. About the satisfaction she found in fixing things, in taking something broken and making it whole again. About the pride in her voice when he finished a repair correctly, the gentle correction when he cut corners.

She would have liked this place, he thought. The old wood and careful maintenance. The respect for tradition and craftsmanship. The way everything had its place and purpose.

She would have liked Katsuhito too. Would have recognized in him the same stubborn competence that she had cultivated in herself. Two people who had learned that the world did not give you what you needed—you had to build it yourself, one repair at a time.

By late morning, the most urgent tasks were complete. The roof no longer leaked. The fence stood straight. The door closed properly. Small victories, invisible to anyone who did not know to look for them, but real nonetheless.

Sheldon cleaned his tools, returned them to their proper places, and prepared to venture into the village.

---

The walk down the three hundred steps was different in daylight than it had been at dusk.

The forest pressed close on either side, but now he could see the details he had missed before. Ferns growing in the shade of larger trees. Moss covering stones in patterns that looked almost deliberate. Small shrines tucked into alcoves, their offerings of coins and rice indicating that someone still tended them.

The steps themselves told a story. Worn smooth in the center, where countless feet had fallen over countless years. Rougher at the edges, where fewer people walked. Cracked in places where roots had pushed up from below, the patient pressure of growing things reshaping the stone.

He wondered how old these steps were. How many generations had climbed them, seeking whatever the shrine offered. How many would climb them after he was gone.

The village waited at the bottom, quiet in the late morning lull between the activity of dawn and the bustle of midday.

The Tsukino property was exactly where his documents said it would be.

A small traditional building on a side street, two stories, wooden construction weathered to a soft gray. A sign above the door had faded to illegibility, but the shape of the characters was still visible if you looked closely. A shop of some kind, once. Closed now for years, judging by the dust on the windows and the weeds growing between the paving stones.

Sheldon stood across the street and looked at it for a long moment.

This was his, supposedly. This building, this plot of land, this piece of a stranger's life that had somehow become his inheritance. The documentation in his pocket said so. The village records, presumably, would confirm it.

He crossed the street, retrieved the key from his pocket, and let himself in.

---

Inside, the air was stale and still, thick with the particular quality of long disuse.

Dust covered everything, muffling shapes into ghosts of themselves. A counter ran along one wall, the kind that would have separated shopkeeper from customer. Shelves behind it, mostly empty, a few boxes remaining in shadowed corners. Wooden floors, warped slightly in one corner where water had gotten in at some point. A staircase leading up to what he assumed were living quarters.

Sheldon stepped inside and closed the door behind him.

The ground floor had been a shop, that much was clear. The layout was practical: customer area in front, work area behind, storage in the back. The ceiling was low by American standards but typical for Japanese construction, the beams dark with age and smoke. A small courtyard was visible through a window at the back, overgrown with weeds but still intact.

He walked through slowly, not touching anything, just observing. Taking inventory. The water damage was localized—one corner near the back, probably from a leak in the roof. The structure itself seemed sound. No obvious signs of pest infestation. The walls needed cleaning, the floors needed refinishing, the fixtures needed replacing. But the bones were good.

Upstairs was smaller than he expected.

Two rooms and a tiny bathroom, barely enough space for one person to live comfortably. One room was empty except for dust and a single futon frame, its padding long since removed or rotted away. The other room...

The other room had photographs.

They were arranged on a low shelf near the window, protected from direct sunlight by the angle of the eaves but still visible to anyone who entered. Old photographs in simple frames, the kind that families accumulated over generations.

Sheldon approached slowly, as though the images might vanish if he moved too quickly.

The oldest photograph showed a couple in formal wear, the style dating to perhaps the 1920s or 1930s. A man and woman, Japanese, standing stiffly before a painted backdrop. The woman held a fan; the man wore Western dress. Their faces were solemn in the way that early photographs demanded, holding still for the long exposure.

The next photograph was newer, perhaps 1950s. A family: older couple, younger couple, a small child. Three generations of Tsukinos, if the name was real, arranged before what might have been this very building. The child was a boy, maybe four or five, grinning at the camera with the lack of restraint that adult propriety had not yet trained away.

More photographs. A young man in university clothes. A wedding portrait. A woman holding an infant. Each image added another branch to a family tree that Sheldon had supposedly inherited, another layer of history that someone had constructed—or that had simply existed, waiting for him to claim it.

The most recent photograph was from perhaps ten years ago, judging by the style and coloring. An elderly man stood alone in front of the shop, the sign above the door still legible: 月野雑貨店. Tsukino General Store. The man's face was tired but proud, his hand resting on the doorframe with the casual ownership of someone who had spent his life in this place.

Sheldon did not recognize him.

He did not recognize any of them.

But they were, apparently, his family now. His history. The backstory that whoever had arranged his arrival had either invented or repurposed for his use.

The old man in the most recent photograph had lived here. Had walked these floors. Had opened this same window to let in the morning light. Had looked at these same photographs of parents and grandparents and felt... what? Pride? Loneliness? The particular ache of being the last of a line?

Sheldon would never know. That was the strange tragedy of inheriting a life—you got the artifacts without the context, the objects without the memories that gave them meaning.

But he could honor them. Could keep them clean and safe. Could treat them with the respect that generations of Tsukino family members deserved, even if those family members had never known him and he would never know them.

He sat down on the dusty floor, his back against the wall, and stared at the photographs until the light through the window began to shift.

---

The system had been thorough.

He tested it over the next hour, searching through the building for evidence of fabrication, for the seams where a constructed history might show its stitches. He found none.

The photographs were real—actual prints, with the fading and wear of genuine age. The documents in a drawer downstairs were real: business records from the shop, handwritten in Japanese that predated his supposed birth, tracking sales and inventory in the patient columns of someone who took their work seriously. There were letters, too, folded into envelopes with stamps that matched their postmarks, correspondence between Tsukino family members that spanned decades.

He found a small box in the back of one drawer, wrapped in cloth that had once been blue but had faded to gray. Inside were personal items: a pocket watch that no longer worked, a woman's hair ornament made of lacquered wood, a child's drawing on paper gone brown with age. Treasures, clearly. Things that someone had saved not for their value but for their meaning.

The drawing showed a house—this house, probably—with stick figures in front. A man, a woman, a child. The child had drawn himself larger than his parents, in the way that children often did, his stick arms spread wide in what might have been joy or simply the difficulty of drawing proportional limbs.

Sheldon held the drawing for a long moment, feeling the weight of all the lives that had passed through this space.

He put it back in the box, wrapped the cloth around it carefully, and returned it to its drawer.

If this was fabrication, it was fabrication on a scale that staggered him.

More likely, the system had simply... inserted him. Found a family line that had ended without heirs, slotted him into the empty space, arranged the paperwork so that anyone checking would find exactly what they expected to find. The last Tsukino—the old man in the photograph—had apparently died without children, without close relatives, leaving his property to whatever distant connection the legal system could locate.

That connection was now Sheldon.

The implications were profound. If the system could do this—could create or appropriate an entire family history, complete with physical evidence spanning decades—what else could it do? What other aspects of this world had been adjusted to accommodate his presence?

He thought about the conversation in the kitchen that morning. Katsuhito's easy acceptance of a stranger who had appeared from nowhere with a convenient story. Tenchi's immediate attachment to someone he had just met. Were these natural reactions, or had something been done to smooth his way?

He had no way to know. The system was silent, and the world gave him no answers.

All he could do was proceed as though everything were real. As though the people around him were exactly who they appeared to be, and their reactions were genuine, and the history he had inherited was as meaningful as any history could be.

Because the alternative—doubting everything, trusting nothing, living in a state of perpetual suspicion—was no way to live at all.

He explored the rest of the building. The kitchen, small but functional, its fixtures outdated but intact. A pantry with empty shelves and the faint smell of old spices. A back door that opened onto the overgrown courtyard, where a single tree had grown wild and untended, its branches reaching toward the sky as though trying to escape the walls that surrounded it.

The courtyard had been a garden once. He could see the bones of it beneath the weeds: raised beds for vegetables, a small pond that had silted in, a stone lantern that leaned at a precarious angle. Neglect, not destruction. The kind of decay that came from absence rather than violence.

He could fix this. Given time and effort, he could restore the garden to something functional. Could clear the weeds, repair the pond, straighten the lantern. Could plant vegetables in the raised beds and herbs along the borders and create something that lived and grew and produced.

But not today. Today was for observation. Today was for understanding what he had inherited and what it would require of him.

---

The village was busier when he emerged from the property, the main street populated with people going about their daily business.

1989.

The differences from his own time were everywhere once he started looking. No cell phones, obviously—no one walking with heads bowed over screens, no constant low murmur of one-sided conversations. But more than that. The cars were different, boxy shapes that predated the streamlined designs of later decades. The fashion was different, hair and clothing styles that he vaguely recognized from old photographs. The advertisements in shop windows were hand-painted or printed on simple paper, not the glossy digital displays he was used to.

He passed an electronics shop and paused to look at the display.

VCRs. Cassette players. A television that must have weighed fifty pounds, its cathode ray tube encased in wood paneling. Prices in yen that seemed absurdly low until he remembered to adjust for inflation and exchange rate. A sign in the window advertised the newest technology: a compact disc player, displayed like a treasure.

Thirty-six years before his death. Before the internet. Before smartphones. Before the technological acceleration that had defined his adult life.

He was going to have to learn to live without instant access to information. Without the ability to look up any question that occurred to him. Without the thousands of small conveniences that he had not even realized he was relying on until they were gone.

The thought was more liberating than he expected.

He walked further into the village, following streets that curved and branched in patterns that had nothing to do with grid planning. The buildings grew older as he moved away from the main road, their architecture shifting from post-war practical to pre-war traditional. Tile roofs darkened with age. Wooden walls that had been standing for a century or more. Gardens glimpsed through gaps in fences, carefully tended spaces that represented generations of accumulated care.

A temple appeared around one corner, its gate marked with characters he could read: Mountain Spirit Temple. Buddhist, from the style of the architecture. A smaller structure than the Shinto shrine on the hill, but well-maintained, its grounds neat and its incense burners recently used.

He paused at the gate but did not enter. There would be time to explore the temple later, to learn its history and meet its priest. For now, he was simply mapping. Learning the geography of his new home.

Beyond the temple, the road narrowed and began to climb. Houses became sparse. Fields appeared, terraced into the hillside with the patient engineering of centuries. A farmer worked in one of the fields, bent over rows of what might have been vegetables, his movements slow and rhythmic.

Sheldon watched for a moment, appreciating the scene. This was what Japan had looked like for hundreds of years. What it would continue to look like, he suspected, long after the cities had transformed themselves beyond recognition. The rural areas held onto their traditions with a grip that modernization could not easily break.

He turned back toward the village center, his mental map expanding with each step.

---

The grocery store was small and well-stocked, its shelves organized with careful attention.

Fresh vegetables in wooden crates. Fish on ice behind a glass counter. Rice in large bags, graded by quality and price. The smell was clean and organic, nothing like the antiseptic sameness of American supermarkets.

Sheldon browsed without buying, learning the layout, noting prices, filing information away for future reference. The shopkeeper—a middle-aged woman with a round face and curious eyes—watched him without pretense.

"You are the one staying at the shrine," she said when he approached the counter. It was not a question.

"Yes. My name is Tsukino Sheldon."

Her eyebrows rose at the surname. "Tsukino? Like old Tsukino-san who had the shop on Third Street?"

"A distant relative. I inherited the property."

"Ah." She nodded, processing this information, fitting it into whatever map she kept of the village and its inhabitants. "He was a good man. Quiet. Kept to himself. The shop closed when he got sick. That was... three years ago now? Maybe four."

"I did not know him well. We were not close."

"Still. Family is family." She tilted her head, studying him with the frank assessment of someone who had spent decades learning to read customers. "You are not Japanese."

"No."

"But you speak well."

"I had good teachers."

She smiled at that, the expression softening her features. "Welcome to Masaki Village, Tsukino-san. I am Ito. If you need anything from the store, you come to me. I will give you a fair price."

"Thank you, Ito-san."

He bought a small bag of rice crackers, more to establish himself as a customer than because he needed them, and left with the sense that his existence in this village had just become slightly more real.

---

The climb back up the three hundred steps was easier than he expected.

Yesterday, he had arrived at the top winded and uncertain. Today, the ascent felt almost natural, his body finding a rhythm that matched the spacing of the stone treads. His legs did not burn. His lungs did not protest. Whatever changes the system had made to his physical form, increased stamina seemed to be among them.

Or perhaps he was simply adjusting. Adapting. Becoming the person this world needed him to be.

The shrine grounds were quiet in the late afternoon light. Katsuhito was not visible, but smoke rose from a small building behind the main hall—a workshop, perhaps, or a forge. Tenchi's voice came from somewhere inside the house, high and animated, apparently engaged in a one-sided conversation with someone or something—Kabutaro, most likely, receiving a detailed account of the day's adventures.

Sheldon crossed to the workshop and looked inside.

It was a combination of toolshed and project space, the walls lined with implements that spanned generations of technology. Hand tools hung in neat rows: saws and hammers and chisels, their handles worn smooth by decades of use. A workbench dominated the center of the room, its surface scarred by countless projects. Shelves held boxes of hardware, labeled in handwriting that had faded with time.

A list was tacked to the wall near the door. Tasks, written in precise characters, each one a small project that needed attention. He had completed several of them that morning. More remained.

Sheldon selected tools from the wall—a hammer, a saw, a level, a measuring tape—and went to continue his work.

---

The west porch had a loose board that needed attention.

A section of the engawa near the corner of the house had developed a slight bounce, the kind of give that suggested a failing support rather than a damaged plank. Sheldon knelt and examined the area, pressing with his hands to feel the flex, listening to the sounds the wood made under stress.

The problem was a cracked joist beneath the decking. Not rotted through, just cracked, probably from stress and age. The previous repairs—and there had been previous repairs, he could see the evidence—had addressed symptoms rather than cause.

He would need to reinforce the joist, not just stabilize the board. That meant access from below, which meant crawling into the space beneath the engawa, which meant getting dirty.

Sheldon went to work.

The crawlspace was tight but navigable, the earth beneath cool and slightly damp. He brought a flashlight from the workshop and positioned himself beneath the problem area, confirming his diagnosis. The crack was worse than he had expected from above, running nearly half the length of the joist.

He spent an hour in the dim space, cutting a sister board to size, positioning it alongside the damaged joist, securing it with screws that bit deep into the old wood. When he finished and crawled back out, his clothes were filthy and his shoulders ached from the awkward positioning.

But the board no longer bounced when he tested it. The repair would hold for years, maybe decades, if the wood stayed dry and no one put unusual stress on the area.

He made a note to check the other joists when he had time. If one had cracked, others might be close behind.

---

Dinner was similar to breakfast: simple, balanced, prepared with the efficiency of long practice.

The meal was grilled fish again—a different type than breakfast, larger and oilier, with a richer flavor that spoke of deeper waters. Rice, of course, always rice. Pickled vegetables in a slightly different preparation. Miso soup with different ingredients, tofu and seaweed instead of the morning's simpler version.

Sheldon was beginning to understand the structure of Japanese home cooking. The same basic elements, recombined and varied, creating a sense of continuity without monotony. It reminded him of jazz, in a way. A shared vocabulary of ingredients and techniques, with endless room for improvisation within the established forms.

Tenchi dominated the conversation, as seemed to be his habit. He had spent the afternoon showing Kabutaro every notable feature of the shrine grounds, narrating each location as though the beetle were a visiting dignitary who required a comprehensive tour.

"The big tree is very old," he explained to Sheldon, apparently believing the beetle had not adequately conveyed this information. "Grandpa says it was here before the shrine. Before everything. He says it remembers things that people have forgotten."

"Trees have long memories," Sheldon agreed.

"Do they really remember? Can they think?"

"I do not know. But they experience things. They respond to their environment. They grow toward the light and send roots toward water. Whether that counts as thinking... that is a philosophical question."

Tenchi's face scrunched in the way that indicated he was processing something beyond his current understanding.

"I do not know what philosophical means."

"It means a question that people have been arguing about for thousands of years without reaching an answer."

"That seems like a waste of time."

"Sometimes the arguing is more important than the answer."

Tenchi considered this, then shook his head. "That does not make sense."

"No," Sheldon admitted. "It often does not."

Katsuhito said nothing, but Sheldon caught the faintest hint of amusement at the corner of his mouth.

"Kabutaro liked the tree," Tenchi continued, returning to his earlier narrative. "He walked around on the bark for a long time. I think he was saying hello."

"Perhaps he was," Sheldon said.

"Do you think the tree said hello back?"

"I think the tree noticed him. Whether that counts as saying hello... that is another philosophical question."

Tenchi sighed dramatically. "Everything is a philosophical question with grown-ups."

"That is because grown-ups have had more time to realize how complicated everything is."

"Is that why Grandpa never gives me straight answers?"

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito, who was studying his rice bowl with sudden intensity.

"I think your grandfather gives you exactly the answers you need," Sheldon said carefully. "Even when they are not the answers you want."

Tenchi considered this, his small face serious. Then he nodded slowly.

"That is probably true. Grandpa is very wise." He paused. "Even if he is also very confusing."

"Wisdom and confusion often go together," Sheldon said.

"That is the most confusing thing you have said yet."

Sheldon laughed, and after a moment, Tenchi laughed too, and even Katsuhito's stern expression softened into something that might almost have been a smile.

---

After dinner, Sheldon helped clear the dishes and then excused himself to the engawa.

The evening was cool and clear, the stars beginning to appear in the darkening sky. The forest below was a sea of shadow, punctuated by the calls of night birds and the steady chirp of insects. Peaceful. Quiet. The kind of peace that came from being far from anything resembling a city.

He thought about the property in the village. The photographs of people he did not know. The documents that constructed a history he had not lived. The system—still mostly silent, still mostly inaccessible—that had arranged all of this without explanation.

He thought about his grandmother, who had died three years before his accident. About the house in Georgia that he had sold because he could not bear to keep it. About the life he had left behind, the research and the colleagues and the quiet satisfactions of work that mattered.

He thought about Tenchi, five years old and already carrying weight. About Katsuhito, sharp and guarded and grieving in ways he did not show. About Kiyone, who had lived in the room where Sheldon now slept, whose absence was felt in every corner of this house.

Tomorrow, he would continue landing. Continue settling. Continue building the life that whatever had brought him here seemed to want him to build.

He was here. He was alive. He had a place to land.

*When things go wrong, you stop, you breathe, you think. Then you act.*

He was acting. Step by step. Day by day. One repair at a time.

In his old life, he had been good at isolation. Had cultivated it, even, telling himself that focus required sacrifice, that achievement required solitude. His grandmother had been the exception, the one person he allowed past his walls. After she died, those walls had grown higher.

Here, he could not afford walls. Could not afford isolation. The very fabric of Japanese rural life demanded connection, community, the slow accumulation of relationships that supported and sustained. A man alone in this place would not survive—not physically, perhaps, but socially, emotionally.

He would have to learn to let people in.

He would have to learn to be the kind of person worth letting in.

The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and ancient. The forest breathed its slow, green breath. Somewhere in the house behind him, Tenchi laughed at something, the sound carrying through the thin walls like a promise.

Tomorrow. Tomorrow would be Day 3.

Sheldon stayed on the engawa until the night grew cold, then went inside to sleep.

⁂

---

## Day 3

---

## Wednesday, April 5, 1989

---

Sheldon woke before the birds.

The room was still dark, the window a rectangle of deep blue against the black of the walls. He lay in the futon and listened to the silence, feeling the weight of the blanket across his chest, the firm support of the tatami beneath him.

His body had adjusted to this schedule with unsettling speed. Three days ago—had it only been three days?—he had been living on Alaska time, his rhythms shaped by the long nights and short days of approaching polar winter. Now he was waking with the sun in rural Japan, his internal clock recalibrated as though the intervening decades and time zones had never existed.

He wondered if that was normal. If bodies could adapt that quickly, or if this was another gift from whoever had rebuilt him.

The warmth stirred at the edge of his awareness, present but unhelpful. It was always there now, a faint pressure behind his thoughts, like a door that was closed but not locked. He had tried again yesterday, before sleep, to engage with it. Had asked questions in his mind, had focused on the sensation, had attempted to will it into communication.

Nothing. Or almost nothing—a flicker of acknowledgment, perhaps, the sense of being heard without being answered. The system, whatever it was, was not interested in conversation.

He had been a scientist. He knew how to test hypotheses, how to design experiments, how to isolate variables and measure outcomes. But how did you run experiments on something that existed only in your mind? How did you measure a warmth that had no temperature, a presence that left no physical trace?

He would figure it out. Eventually. For now, he had other things to focus on.

The birds began their chorus as he dressed, their songs filtering through the shoji screens like an announcement. Dawn was coming. The day was beginning. There was work to do.

---

Katsuhito was already awake when Sheldon entered the kitchen.

The old man sat at the low table, a cup of tea steaming before him, his posture straight despite the early hour. He did not look up as Sheldon appeared in the doorway, but his stillness shifted slightly—the subtle acknowledgment of another presence that Sheldon was learning to recognize.

"Good morning," Sheldon said.

"You are early again."

"I wake when I wake."

A small sound, not quite a grunt, that might have been approval or might have been simple acknowledgment. Katsuhito lifted his tea and sipped, his eyes fixed on something beyond the window.

The kitchen was cool in the pre-dawn darkness, the air carrying the faint smell of last night's cooking and this morning's tea. Sheldon moved to the counter and began preparing breakfast without being asked. Rice from the cooker. Miso soup reheated from the batch Katsuhito had made the day before. Pickled vegetables from a jar in the small refrigerator.

They had not discussed the division of labor. It had simply emerged, over these first days, a pattern shaped by observation and adjustment. Katsuhito cooked dinner. Sheldon handled breakfast and lunch. Both of them cleaned up after themselves. Neither commented on the arrangement.

It was, Sheldon reflected, a very Japanese way of doing things. Nothing explicitly stated. No formal negotiation. Just behavior observed and matched, roles assumed based on what worked rather than what was agreed upon. He had encountered similar dynamics in his work with Japanese colleagues—the unspoken understandings that governed behavior more effectively than any written contract.

He wondered if he would ever fully understand this culture, or if he would always be an outsider trying to read a language he could speak but not feel.

The rice was nearly done when he heard small footsteps in the hallway—Tenchi, awake earlier than expected, probably drawn by the sounds and smells of morning routine.

"Tenchi has school today," Katsuhito said, preempting the boy's arrival.

"I assumed. He mentioned kindergarten yesterday."

"He will need to be ready by seven-thirty. The bus comes to the bottom of the steps."

Sheldon paused, considering the logistics. Three hundred steps. A five-year-old. Half an hour to get down and wait for the bus.

"Does he walk down alone?"

"I walk with him. He is too young to navigate the steps safely by himself." Katsuhito set down his tea. "Today, you will come with us."

It was not a question. Sheldon nodded.

---

Tenchi appeared at seven-fifteen, already dressed in his school clothes: a white shirt, navy shorts, a yellow hat that marked him as a kindergartener. His backpack was shaped like a turtle, its shell bulging with whatever supplies a five-year-old needed for a day of structured play and early learning.

"Sheldon-san!" The boy's face lit up when he saw him. "Are you coming to the bus stop? Grandpa never lets anyone come to the bus stop. He says it is our special time."

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito, who was tying his shoes by the door with studied attention.

"Your grandfather invited me."

"Really?" Tenchi looked between them, his expression shifting through surprise and curiosity and something that might have been hope. "That is very special. Grandpa does not share special times with just anyone."

"Tenchi." Katsuhito's voice carried the weight of gentle warning. "Finish your breakfast. The bus will not wait."

The boy scrambled to the table, where a small bowl of rice and a cup of soup waited. He ate with the focused intensity of a child who had been reminded of a deadline, his chopsticks moving efficiently despite his youth.

Sheldon sat and ate his own breakfast, watching the morning routine unfold. Katsuhito checked Tenchi's bag, confirming the presence of items Sheldon could not identify. Tenchi wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and was immediately corrected, redirected to a napkin. Small negotiations, small corrections, the accumulated rituals of a household learning to function without its missing member.

Kiyone would have done this, Sheldon thought. Would have packed the bag and checked the contents and reminded her son about napkins. Would have walked him down the three hundred steps, holding his hand on the steeper sections, making sure he reached the bus safely.

Now that job belonged to an old man who should have been enjoying retirement, and perhaps to a stranger who had appeared from nowhere three days ago.

Grief was strange. It lived in the spaces between actions, in the gaps where someone should have been and was not.

---

The walk down the steps was slower than Sheldon expected.

Tenchi moved carefully, one step at a time, his small hand gripping the stone railing where it existed and reaching for Katsuhito's hand where it did not. The old man matched his pace to the boy's without apparent effort, his own steps steady and measured despite the uneven terrain.

Sheldon followed a few steps behind, observing.

The morning was cool and bright, the sun just clearing the mountain peaks to the east. Mist hung in the valley below, softening the outlines of the village into something dreamlike. Birds moved through the forest on either side of the stairway, their calls echoing off the stone.

The steps themselves were a marvel of accumulated labor. Each stone had been placed by hand, fitted into the slope with an understanding of weight and weather that spoke to generations of experience. Some steps were worn smooth in the center, polished by thousands of feet over decades or centuries. Others were rougher, replaced more recently, their surfaces still showing the marks of tools.

Sheldon found himself wondering about the history of this stairway. Who had built it? How long had it taken? Had there been a single architect, or had it grown organically, each generation adding to what the previous had begun?

He would probably never know. Some questions did not have answers that survived the passage of time.

"Grandpa," Tenchi said, about a third of the way down, "why are the steps so long?"

"So that people who climb them have time to prepare their hearts."

"Prepare for what?"

"For meeting the kami. For being in a sacred place." Katsuhito's voice was patient, the tone of someone who had answered this question before. "The steps are a journey. The shrine is the destination. But the journey matters as much as the arrival."

Tenchi considered this with the gravity of a child processing adult concepts.

"I think the steps are too long," he concluded. "My legs get tired."

"Your legs will grow."

"When?"

"When you are ready."

Sheldon smiled despite himself. The conversation had the rhythm of a routine, questions and answers that had been exchanged many times before. Tenchi asking why, Katsuhito answering with patience and gentle philosophy, neither of them quite satisfying the other but both of them content with the exchange.

This was what family looked like, he realized. Not grand gestures or dramatic moments, but small conversations on long staircases. The accumulation of ordinary days into something extraordinary.

He wondered if he would ever feel like part of it, or if he would always be the observer, watching from a few steps behind.

---

The bus stop was a small shelter at the base of the steps, a wooden structure with a bench and a faded schedule posted under glass. Two other children were already waiting, accompanied by mothers who looked up with curious eyes as the group from the shrine approached.

One of the children was a girl about Tenchi's age, her hair pulled back in neat pigtails, her uniform identical to his except for a skirt instead of shorts. The other was a boy slightly older, perhaps seven, his manner suggesting the superiority that first-graders often felt over kindergarteners.

"Tenchi-kun!" The girl waved enthusiastically. "You are here!"

"Miki-chan!" Tenchi released Katsuhito's hand and ran to join his classmates, immediately launching into a conversation that seemed to consist entirely of exclamations and incomplete sentences.

Sheldon hung back, letting Katsuhito move ahead. He understood the calculus of small communities: strangers were noticed, assessed, discussed. His presence would generate questions that he would rather not answer in front of children.

The mothers watched him with the particular attention of people trying not to stare. He was used to this, had been used to it his entire life—the awareness of being visibly different, the weight of eyes that tried to categorize and understand. In America, he had been Black in spaces that expected whiteness. Here, he was foreign in ways that went beyond race, a stranger in a culture that had spent centuries perfecting the art of distinguishing inside from outside.

He kept his expression neutral, his posture relaxed. Non-threatening. Patient. Let them look. Let them wonder. Eventually, they would grow accustomed to his presence, or they would not. Either way, he could not control their reactions, only his own.

"Masaki-san." One of the mothers bowed slightly. "Good morning."

"Yamada-san. Kobayashi-san." Katsuhito returned the bow. "A fine morning."

"Very fine." Yamada-san's eyes slid past Katsuhito to where Sheldon stood. "You have a guest?"

"A relative of the Tsukino family. He is staying at the shrine while he settles the property."

The explanation was smooth, rehearsed. Sheldon wondered how many times Katsuhito had already delivered it, or how many more times he would need to.

"Ah, the Tsukino place." Kobayashi-san nodded, her expression shifting to something like sympathy. "Such a shame about old Tsukino-san. He was a kind man."

"He was."

"Your relative—" She hesitated, the question forming but not quite asked.

"American," Katsuhito said. "On his mother's side."

The women exchanged a glance that communicated volumes. American. That explained the skin, the features, the foreignness that stood out so starkly in this homogeneous village. An acceptable foreignness, perhaps, if it came with Japanese family connections.

Sheldon did not correct the story. Did not add details or volunteer explanations. He simply stood and waited and let the narrative that Katsuhito was constructing settle into the community's understanding.

The bus arrived before the conversation could continue, a small yellow vehicle that looked like it had been running these roads for decades. Tenchi climbed aboard with the other children, turning at the door to wave enthusiastically.

"Bye, Grandpa! Bye, Sheldon-san! I will tell you about everything when I come home!"

The doors closed. The bus pulled away. The mothers dispersed to their own mornings, their curiosity temporarily satisfied.

Katsuhito stood watching until the bus disappeared around a curve in the road. Then he turned and began climbing back up the steps.

Sheldon followed.

---

The climb was different without Tenchi.

Faster, for one thing. Katsuhito set a pace that would have been punishing for the boy, his legs finding a rhythm that ate up the steps with deceptive ease. Sheldon matched him without difficulty, his rebuilt body apparently capable of sustained effort that his old body would have struggled with.

The old man moved with a fluidity that belied his age. Each step was placed with precision, his weight shifting smoothly from one foot to the next, his breathing steady and controlled. Sheldon, who had spent years studying the mechanics of motion in various contexts, recognized the quality of that movement. This was not the careless ease of youth. This was mastery—the kind of physical control that came only from decades of practice.

What did a Shinto priest practice that gave him movement like that?

Sheldon filed the observation away. Another piece of the puzzle that was Masaki Katsuhito.

But beyond the pace, the silence was different. With Tenchi present, conversation was unnecessary—the boy filled every gap with questions and observations and the endless narration of childhood. Without him, the silence had weight.

They climbed in that silence for a hundred steps, then two hundred, the forest closing around them, the shrine growing closer above. The morning light filtered through the canopy in shafts and patterns, painting the worn stone with gold and green. Somewhere off the path, a stream gurgled over rocks, its sound a constant murmur beneath the birdsong.

Sheldon found his mind wandering to questions of physics. The stone steps had been here for centuries, worn by millions of footsteps, eroded by countless rainstorms. Each step was measurably smaller than it had been when first placed. Given enough time, the steps would wear away entirely, leaving only the slope they had been cut into.

Entropy, he thought. The universe's slow slide toward disorder. Even stone succumbed eventually.

But these steps were maintained. Repaired. The damage from entropy was counteracted by human effort, by the patient work of generations who valued the stairway enough to preserve it.

That was the other side of the equation, the part that physics alone could not capture. Human beings created order, fought against entropy, built things that outlasted their individual lives. The stairway was not just physics. It was culture, tradition, love made manifest in labor.

"You handled that well," Katsuhito said finally, breaking the silence.

Sheldon waited, unsure which part was being referenced.

"The mothers. They will have questions. They will gossip. That is the nature of small villages." The old man did not slow his pace or turn his head. "But you did not make it worse. Did not volunteer information that would need to be explained later."

"I let you control the narrative."

"Yes." A pause. "That was wise."

They climbed another fifty steps in silence.

"You will need a more complete story," Katsuhito continued. "For the village. For anyone who asks. The bones you have are sufficient—Tsukino relative, American mother, here to settle the property. But bones need flesh. Details that feel true even if they are not."

"I understand."

"Do you?" For the first time, Katsuhito glanced back at him, his eyes sharp. "Creating a history is not simple. The details must fit together. Must explain not just what you are but why you are here, now, in this way. A story with holes invites investigation. A story without holes invites acceptance."

Sheldon considered this as they climbed the final steps.

"You sound like you have experience with this."

Katsuhito reached the top and turned, his breathing barely affected by the climb. His expression was unreadable.

"I am an old man who has lived a long life. I have seen many things." He paused. "Some of those things required careful stories."

He turned and walked toward the shrine, leaving Sheldon to wonder what stories an elderly Shinto priest might need to tell, and why he seemed so comfortable coaching a stranger in the art of constructed identity.

---

With Tenchi at school, the shrine was quiet in a way it had not been before.

Sheldon had not realized how much the boy's presence filled the space until it was absent. The house felt larger without his small footsteps echoing through the hallways. The grounds felt emptier without his voice narrating every discovery. Even the birds seemed subdued, as though respecting the temporary vacancy.

He threw himself into work.

The list in the workshop had grown shorter over the past two days, but there were always more tasks to discover. He spent the first hour walking the shrine grounds with fresh eyes, looking for problems he might have missed on earlier inspections. A systematic approach, the kind he would have used in the lab: document everything, prioritize by severity, address the most urgent issues first.

The roof problem revealed itself during this survey. One of the smaller buildings—a storage structure near the back of the compound—showed signs of water damage on its interior walls. Staining that ran from ceiling to floor, warping in the wooden beams, the faint smell of moisture that should not have been there.

He climbed a ladder to examine the roof from the outside and found the source: tiles that had shifted, opening gaps where rain could penetrate. Not catastrophic damage, not yet, but the kind of slow deterioration that would become serious if left unaddressed.

The repair required climbing onto the roof itself, working carefully on the sloped surface, repositioning tiles that had been dislodged by wind or age.

He was not afraid of heights. Had never been afraid of heights, even as a child. His grandmother had told him once that fear was a choice, and he had chosen not to be afraid of the things that did not deserve fear. Heights were just distance from the ground. Falling was just physics. If you respected the physics and worked within its constraints, there was nothing to fear.

But there was something different about working on a roof in 1989, without safety harnesses or fall protection, without anyone to call if something went wrong. Just him and the tiles and the long drop to the ground below.

He thought about his grandmother as he worked. About the way she had taught him to approach dangerous tasks. "You don't rush," she used to say. "You don't get distracted. You keep your mind on what you're doing, and you do it right, and then you come home and have dinner."

Simple advice. Practical advice. The kind of wisdom that seemed obvious until you were thirty feet in the air, balanced on century-old tiles, wondering if the next step would hold your weight.

He worked carefully. Methodically. The way she had taught him.

The tiles were heavy and irregular, each one slightly different from its neighbors. Traditional construction, he realized. No factory standardization. Every tile hand-made, hand-placed, fitting into a pattern that existed only in the builder's mind.

He thought about the hands that had originally laid these tiles. How many generations ago? How many people had lived under this roof, trusting it to keep them dry, never knowing the name of whoever had done the work?

That was a kind of immortality, he supposed. Not fame or memory, but function. The tiles would still be keeping rain out long after everyone who remembered his name was gone.

When he finished the roof repair, it was still late morning. He climbed down carefully, put away his tools, and found himself drawn again to the great tree.

---

It stood near the main hall, as it had since before the shrine was built—or so Sheldon assumed. A tree this size did not grow in decades. It grew in centuries. Whoever had established this shrine had done so in the shadow of something already ancient.

He walked around it slowly, studying the trunk from different angles. The bark was deeply furrowed, creating patterns that almost looked deliberate, like writing in a language he could not read. Moss grew in some of the deeper crevices, adding patches of vivid green to the grey-brown of the wood. The roots spread across the ground in great humps and hollows, some of them worn smooth by the passage of feet, others hidden beneath accumulated leaf litter.

At ground level, the tree was simply massive. But as his eyes traveled upward, tracing the trunk to where it began to branch, he felt something else. A sense of... presence, perhaps. Not malevolent, not welcoming, just there. The tree was aware, in whatever way trees could be aware. It had been standing here, growing, existing, for longer than human memory, and it would continue long after he was gone.

He thought of the warmth at the edge of his awareness, the presence that watched but did not speak. Was this similar? Another consciousness that existed on a different scale, with different priorities, unable or unwilling to communicate in ways humans could understand?

He placed his palm against the bark.

It was warm. Warmer than the air, warmer than it should have been in the morning cool. The texture was rough against his skin, alive in a way that seemed more than botanical.

He stood there for a long moment, palm pressed to the tree, feeling its warmth and presence. Then he withdrew his hand and stepped back.

Whatever this tree was, whatever it knew or felt or remembered, it was not ready to share those things with him. And he was not ready to ask.

There would be time. There was always time. The tree had been here for centuries. It would be here tomorrow, and next week, and next year. He could learn its secrets slowly, or not at all. Either way, it would remain.

He bowed slightly—not quite knowing why, just feeling that it was appropriate—and went to find lunch.

---

By the time he finished, the sun was high and his shoulders ached from the awkward positioning. He climbed down carefully, returned his tools to the workshop, and went to find lunch.

---

Lunch was simple: leftover rice, pickled vegetables, a bowl of miso soup reheated from breakfast. Sheldon ate alone at the low table in the main room, the house quiet around him.

He thought about the morning as he ate. The walk down the steps with Tenchi, the small hand reaching for larger ones. The mothers at the bus stop, their curiosity poorly hidden behind polite smiles. The conversation with Katsuhito on the climb back up—both the words and the silences between them.

He was being tested, he realized. Every interaction was an evaluation, every task an opportunity to prove his worth or reveal his failings. Katsuhito was not hostile, but he was watchful. Careful. The kind of man who had learned that trust was earned in small increments, not given in large gestures.

Fair enough. Sheldon would earn it. One repaired roof, one washed dish, one appropriate response at a time.

The food was good. Simple and good, in the way that simple things often were when they were done correctly. The rice was properly cooked, each grain distinct but tender. The vegetables were crisp and flavorful, the pickling liquid balancing salt and sour in proportions that pleased the palate without overwhelming it. The miso soup had developed depth from sitting overnight, the flavors melding into something more complex than the sum of its parts.

He wondered about the economics of this household. The shrine must have some income—donations from visitors, perhaps, or support from whatever administrative body oversaw Shinto shrines. But Katsuhito did not seem wealthy. The household ran on careful management rather than abundance, making the most of what was available rather than buying whatever was wanted.

It reminded him of his grandmother's house. The same philosophy of sufficiency, of making do, of finding satisfaction in what you had rather than always reaching for more. She had grown up during the Depression, had internalized lessons about scarcity and resourcefulness that never left her even when times improved.

Maybe that was a universal lesson. Maybe all cultures that had known hardship developed similar strategies for living within limits.

He finished his lunch, washed his dishes, and returned to work.

---

Katsuhito was in the main hall, sweeping.

The motion was hypnotic: long, smooth strokes that moved dust and debris toward the door in waves. The broom was the same one Sheldon had seen on his first day, its bristles worn but still effective, its handle darkened by decades of use.

Sheldon watched from the doorway, not wanting to interrupt.

"You may enter," Katsuhito said without turning.

"I did not want to disturb your work."

"Sweeping is not work. It is meditation." The old man continued his strokes, the rhythm unbroken. "The body moves. The mind settles. The dust goes where it should go."

Sheldon stepped over the threshold, feeling again that sense of potential he had noticed the day before. The main hall was dimmer at midday than in the morning, the sun having moved past the angle that lit the interior. Shadows pooled in the corners. Incense smoke curled upward from the altar, barely visible in the half-light.

"You repaired the roof," Katsuhito observed.

"The tiles had shifted. Water was getting in."

"I am aware. I have been meaning to address it for some time." The sweeping paused. "You climb well. Confidently. Without fear."

"I have never been afraid of heights."

"That is not the same as not being afraid." Katsuhito turned, leaning on the broom. "A man who is not afraid of heights does not think about falling. A man who climbs confidently thinks about falling and does it anyway."

Sheldon was not sure how to respond to that.

"I saw you up there," the old man continued. "You placed your feet carefully. Tested each tile before putting weight on it. Moved slowly when speed might have seemed more efficient." His eyes narrowed slightly. "You have done dangerous work before."

"I worked in laboratories. Experimental equipment. Things that could kill you if you were careless."

"Ah." Katsuhito nodded slowly. "A scientist who respects danger. That is not as common as it should be."

"My grandmother taught me. She said that the difference between courage and foolishness was whether you came home at the end of the day."

Something shifted in Katsuhito's expression—not quite softening, but a recognition of something shared.

"Your grandmother sounds like a wise woman."

"She was the wisest person I ever knew."

The words came out with more weight than Sheldon had intended, carrying grief that he usually kept contained. Katsuhito studied him for a long moment, then resumed sweeping.

"The dead shape us," the old man said. "We carry them with us, whether we choose to or not. Their words become our thoughts. Their habits become our habits. Their wisdom, if we are fortunate, becomes our wisdom."

Sheldon thought about the room where he slept. About the dust-shadows of photographs removed. About the absence that lived in every corner of this house.

"You carry someone too," he said.

It was not a question, but Katsuhito answered anyway.

"I carry many. My parents. My teachers. My wife." A pause, the broom stilling. "My daughter."

Kiyone. The name hung between them, unspoken but present.

"Tenchi carries her too," Sheldon said. "Even if he does not know it yet."

"He knows." Katsuhito's voice was quiet. "Children know more than we give them credit for. They feel the shape of absence, even if they cannot name it."

The silence stretched, comfortable in a way it had not been before. Something had shifted between them—not trust, exactly, but the beginning of understanding. Two men who had lost people they loved, finding common ground in the geography of grief.

"Lunch," Katsuhito said finally. "Then there is more work to do."

Sheldon nodded and followed him out of the hall.

---

The afternoon passed in productive quiet.

Sheldon worked on smaller tasks: tightening loose hinges, oiling doors that had begun to stick, replacing worn ropes on the temple bell. Each task was simple in itself, requiring minutes rather than hours, but together they added up to visible progress.

He discovered a rhythm to the work that felt almost meditative. The physical labor engaged his body while freeing his mind to wander. He thought about physics problems he had been working on before the accident—theoretical frameworks that now seemed almost quaint, given what he had experienced. He thought about the nature of his new existence, the questions that multiplied faster than he could answer them. He thought about the family photos in the Tsukino property, the generations of faces that were supposedly now his ancestors.

The temple bell was an interesting project. The rope that hung from it was frayed and weathered, clearly original equipment from whenever the bell had been installed. Replacing it required finding appropriate rope—there was some in the workshop, coiled and waiting as though someone had planned this repair years ago—and then figuring out how to attach it to the bell's mounting bracket without damaging the mechanism.

The bell itself was beautiful. Cast bronze, weathered to a deep green patina, inscribed with characters he could read but not fully understand. Sutras, perhaps, or prayers. The language was formal, archaic, the kind of Japanese that had been used centuries ago and survived only in religious contexts.

He struck the bell once, gently, when the repair was complete. The sound that emerged was deep and resonant, a tone that seemed to come from everywhere at once, filling the shrine grounds before gradually fading into silence.

Katsuhito looked up from his own work, his expression unreadable.

"It has been a long time since that bell was rung," the old man said.

"The old rope was not safe. Someone could have been hurt."

"Perhaps." Katsuhito returned to his work. "Or perhaps it was waiting for someone who knew how to ring it."

Sheldon was not sure what to make of that. He moved on to the next task.

---

Katsuhito worked nearby, doing his own maintenance on the grounds. They did not speak often, but the silence between them was no longer awkward. It was the silence of people working toward a common goal, each trusting the other to do their part.

At three o'clock, Katsuhito set down his tools.

"The bus will return soon. Tenchi will be hungry and full of stories."

"Should I come to the bus stop?"

"No. This afternoon is for the two of us." He paused. "But tomorrow, perhaps. He would like that."

Sheldon nodded, understanding the boundaries being drawn. The morning walk had been a statement, an introduction of the newcomer to the village routine. The afternoon pickup was still sacred, grandfather and grandson time that would not be shared until more trust had been earned.

He watched Katsuhito descend the steps, the old man's pace steady and unhurried, and then returned to his work.

---

The system responded to nothing.

He tried again in the quiet of late afternoon, sitting on the engawa with his eyes closed, reaching for that warmth at the edge of his awareness. He asked questions: What am I supposed to do? Why am I here? What are the rules? He tried commands: Status. Menu. Help. Interface. Inventory. Character. Stats. He tried emotions: gratitude, frustration, curiosity, surrender, anger, acceptance.

Nothing. The presence was there, he was certain of it. He could feel it watching, waiting, existing in some space adjacent to his conscious mind. But it would not engage. Would not explain. Would not give him the roadmap that every isekai story had promised.

He tried a more systematic approach.

First, he tested physical abilities. He stood and performed a series of movements: jumping, stretching, bending, twisting. His body responded perfectly, every motion smooth and controlled. He ran a short distance along the engawa, testing his speed, and found that he was faster than he remembered being—not superhuman, but noticeably improved. His stamina seemed enhanced as well; he was not tired after a day of physical labor that would have exhausted his old body.

Second, he tested mental abilities. He closed his eyes and tried to recall information—formulas, dates, names of people and places. His memory was sharp, perhaps sharper than before, but not impossibly so. He could not suddenly recite pi to a thousand digits or remember books he had only glanced at. Whatever improvements had been made, they were subtle rather than dramatic.

Third, he tested perception. He looked at the world around him and tried to see more than usual—energy fields, hidden information, anything that might indicate supernatural awareness. He saw nothing out of the ordinary. Just trees and sky and the solid reality of the physical world.

The system, whatever it was, had given him a healthier body and a clearer mind. Beyond that, he had no special abilities that he could identify. No magic. No superpowers. Nothing that would set him apart from any other healthy young man except the knowledge that he should not be here at all.

He was a physicist. He understood systems, understood the way complex mechanisms could be analyzed and understood through careful observation. But this system—if it even was a system—defied his every attempt to understand it.

Perhaps that was the point.

Perhaps he was not supposed to understand. Perhaps he was supposed to simply live, to make choices without guidance, to discover whatever he needed to discover through experience rather than instruction.

It was a frustrating hypothesis. But it was the only one that fit the available evidence.

He opened his eyes as footsteps sounded on the stairs below. Tenchi's voice carried up through the trees, high and excited, already launching into an account of his day.

Sheldon stood and went to meet them.

---

"—and then Sato-kun fell in the sandbox, and Yamada-sensei said we had to be more careful, and I was careful, but Sato-kun was not careful, and then we had snack time, and I had the apple slices, and Miki-chan wanted to trade but I said no because I like apples—"

Tenchi's recounting of his day was exhaustive and non-linear, jumping from topic to topic without clear connection, each detail apparently as important as every other. Sheldon listened with what he hoped was appropriate attention, nodding at what seemed like the right moments.

"—and the teacher said we are going to learn about numbers tomorrow, and I already know numbers, Grandpa taught me, but I did not tell her because that would be bragging, and bragging is not nice—"

"That was thoughtful of you," Sheldon offered.

"I know." Tenchi beamed. "Grandpa says being thoughtful is important. More important than being smart." He paused, his small face scrunching in concentration. "Are you thoughtful, Sheldon-san?"

"I try to be."

"I think you are. You fixed the porch without anyone asking. And you made eggs for breakfast. Those are thoughtful things." He nodded firmly, having resolved the question to his satisfaction. "You are thoughtful."

"Thank you, Tenchi."

"You are welcome." The boy skipped ahead toward the house, his turtle backpack bouncing against his shoulders. "I am going to check on Kabutaro! He might be hungry!"

He disappeared inside, leaving Sheldon and Katsuhito alone on the path.

"He likes you," Katsuhito observed.

"He likes everyone."

"No." The old man's voice was quiet but certain. "He is friendly to everyone. Polite. Well-mannered, when he remembers. But he does not like everyone. Not truly." He looked at Sheldon with an expression that was difficult to read. "He liked his mother. He likes his father, when he visits. He likes me." A pause. "Now he likes you."

"I have not done anything to earn it."

"You showed up. You stayed. You fixed things and made breakfast and listened to his stories." Katsuhito began walking toward the house. "For a child who lost his mother eight months ago, that is enough."

---

Dinner was fish again, grilled with salt and served with rice and pickled vegetables.

The menu in this household was simple but varied, each day bringing slight changes in preparation or accompaniment while maintaining the core structure of rice, protein, and vegetables. It was the kind of cooking that came from deep familiarity with ingredients and technique—not flashy or experimental, but deeply satisfying in its consistency.

Sheldon ate with appreciation, his body grateful for the fuel after a day of physical work. He was beginning to understand the rhythms of Japanese meals: the smaller portions that somehow left you satisfied, the emphasis on quality and freshness over quantity, the way each component of the meal contributed to a balanced whole.

Tenchi continued his narration of the day, adding details he had forgotten in the first telling, circling back to correct earlier statements, building an increasingly complete picture of kindergarten life in rural Japan. He had opinions about his classmates (mostly positive), his teacher (strict but fair), the curriculum (too easy), and the playground (not enough swings).

"Yamada-sensei says we are going to grow flowers," he announced between bites. "Each of us gets a pot and seeds and we have to take care of them. If the flower grows, we get a star on the wall."

"What kind of flowers?" Sheldon asked.

"Morning glories. They are blue." Tenchi's face scrunched in thought. "Or purple. I forget which. Maybe both."

"Morning glories can be many colors. Blue and purple and pink and white."

"Really?" The boy's eyes widened. "Maybe I will get a pink one. Pink is Mom's favorite color."

The statement landed with unexpected weight. Tenchi did not seem to notice—he had already moved on to another topic—but Sheldon saw Katsuhito's hand pause over his rice bowl, just for a moment, before continuing.

Small moments. That was where grief lived. In the casual mentions that assumed presence instead of absence. In the future tense applied to someone who no longer had a future.

"I am sure your mother would love whatever color you grow," Sheldon said carefully.

Tenchi nodded, already absorbed in his next thought. But Katsuhito's eyes met Sheldon's across the table, and something passed between them—acknowledgment, perhaps, or gratitude for navigating the moment without making it larger than it needed to be.

"When I am bigger," Tenchi announced, apparently having processed through several intervening topics, "I am going to build a playground with many swings. And a slide that goes very high. And a sandbox that never gets wet."

"That is an ambitious goal," Sheldon said.

"What does ambitious mean?"

"It means big. A plan that takes a lot of work to accomplish."

"Oh." Tenchi considered this. "Then yes. It is ambitious. But I can do it. I can do anything if I work hard enough." He looked at Katsuhito. "Right, Grandpa?"

"Hard work is necessary," the old man said carefully. "But it is not always sufficient. Some things require not just effort but wisdom. Knowing what to work toward, and when to change direction."

Tenchi's face scrunched in the way that indicated he was processing something beyond his current understanding.

"I do not know what that means."

"You will. When you are ready."

"You say that about everything."

"Because it is true about everything."

The boy sighed dramatically, the kind of sigh that only children could produce, full of exasperation at the mysteries adults insisted on keeping.

"Grown-ups are very confusing," he declared.

"Yes," Sheldon agreed. "We are."

---

Later, after Tenchi had been put to bed and the dishes had been cleaned, Sheldon found himself on the engawa again.

The night was clear and cool, the stars brilliant above the dark mass of the forest. The sounds of evening surrounded him: insects, night birds, the distant bark of a dog in the village below. Peaceful sounds. Safe sounds. The kind of sounds that had not existed in Fairbanks, where winter meant silence and summer meant mosquitoes and nothing meant quite this level of natural symphony.

He thought about his grandmother's porch in Georgia. The way she had sat there on summer evenings, rocking in the chair her father had built, watching fireflies rise from the lawn like sparks from an invisible fire. He had sat beside her on many of those evenings, not talking, just being. Just existing in the same space, breathing the same air, watching the same slow spectacle of a rural night.

She would have understood this, he thought. Would have recognized the peace of it, the way time moved differently when you were not fighting it. She had never been to Japan, had never left the South except for brief visits to relatives in Chicago, but she would have understood the quality of this silence.

He missed her with an ache that had not diminished, even now, even with the impossible gulf of time and space that separated them. She had died three years before his accident, and he had thought he was learning to live with her absence. But here, in this strange new life, he found himself reaching for her wisdom constantly.

What would she say about all this? About the dying and the waking and the impossible second chance he had been given?

*Use it well*, probably. She was never one for elaborate philosophy. *Don't waste what you've been given. Make it count.*

He was trying. Day by day, he was trying.

He thought about the day. About the bus stop and the mothers' curious eyes. About climbing on the roof and testing tiles. About the conversation in the main hall, the unexpected intimacy of shared grief. About Tenchi's declaration that he was thoughtful, delivered with the absolute confidence of a child who had not yet learned to doubt his own judgments.

Three days. He had been here three days.

It felt like longer. It felt like no time at all. Time moved strangely when everything was new, when each moment required attention because nothing was automatic yet. The shrine, the village, the routines—all of it was still being learned, still being mapped, still being fitted into a framework that could make sense of his impossible situation.

But he was settling. He could feel it. The edges of strangeness were beginning to soften. The questions about why and how were beginning to fade behind the more immediate concerns of what and when.

He was here. He was staying. He would figure out the rest as he went.

The warmth at the edge of his awareness pulsed once—acknowledgment, perhaps, or encouragement—and then went still.

Sheldon smiled slightly and went inside to sleep.

⁂

## Day 4

## Thursday, April 6, 1989

---

Sheldon woke to the sound of rain.

Not heavy rain—just the gentle patter of droplets against the paper screens, the kind of steady drizzle that could last all day without ever becoming a storm. The light filtering into the room was gray and diffuse, the world outside softened by moisture and cloud.

He lay still for a moment, listening.

Four days. That was how long he had been here. Four days of waking in this room, in this body, in this life that was not quite his but was becoming more familiar with each passing hour. The disorientation was fading, replaced by something that might have been acceptance, or might have been simply the mind's capacity to adapt to circumstances it could not change.

The birds were quieter this morning, their songs muted by the rain. The smell of the tatami was stronger in the damp air, that sweet grass scent mingling with something like petrichor from the open window. He had left the screen cracked the night before, wanting the fresh air, and now the room held a pleasant coolness that made the futon feel even more comfortable.

He did not want to get up.

The thought surprised him. In his old life, he had never been one to linger in bed—there was always too much to do, too many experiments to run, too many papers to write. His alarm would sound and he would be up and moving within minutes, his mind already racing through the day's tasks.

But here, in this quiet room, with rain falling and no deadlines pressing, the simple pleasure of lying still felt like permission. Like a gift he had forgotten how to accept.

He allowed himself five more minutes. Then ten. Then he heard movement in the kitchen—Katsuhito preparing breakfast—and guilt drove him from the futon's embrace.

---

The morning routine was becoming familiar.

Bathroom first: cold water on his face, the shock of it clearing the last cobwebs of sleep. His reflection in the mirror was still strange—that young face with its unlined skin and clear eyes—but he was learning to look at it without flinching. This was his face now. This was who he was.

He took longer at the sink this morning, examining himself more carefully than he had in days. The skin beneath his eyes showed no sign of fatigue despite the short nights. His hair needed attention—the coils were starting to compress where he slept on them, and he had no proper products to maintain them. He added that to the mental list: find a way to care for this hair, to maintain the texture his grandmother had taught him to cherish.

His grandmother had oiled his hair every Sunday morning when he was young. Had worked through it with patient fingers, section by section, talking about life and family and the importance of caring for yourself. Those mornings had been some of his happiest memories—not for any particular thing that happened, but for the simple presence of love made tangible through touch.

He missed her. The ache of it caught him off guard sometimes, rising up from depths he thought he had sealed away. Three years since her death, in his timeline. Thirty-nine years before her birth, in this one.

She was not yet born. His mother was not yet born. The chain of events that would eventually create him had not yet begun.

The thought was dizzying if he let himself dwell on it. So he didn't.

Clothes from the closet: simple work clothes, practical for whatever the day might bring. He was running low on options; the clothing that had been provided was adequate but limited. The work pants were getting worn at the knees from crawling under porches and kneeling on stone paths. The shirts were holding up better, but even they would need replacement eventually.

Another item for the mental list that grew longer each day. Hair products. Clothes. The materials to build a life from scratch.

Kitchen: Katsuhito was already at the stove, his movements precise and unhurried. Rice steamed in its cooker. Miso soup simmered in a pot. The old man did not turn when Sheldon entered, but his posture shifted almost imperceptibly—acknowledgment without interruption.

"The weather," Katsuhito said.

"Rain."

"All day, probably. Not good for outdoor work."

"What would you suggest instead?"

Katsuhito turned, a ladle in one hand. His expression was thoughtful, as though he had been considering this question before Sheldon arrived.

"Your property. In the village. You have not yet made it habitable."

"No. I've only looked at it once."

"Today would be a good day to begin cleaning it. To assess what work it needs. The rain will keep you inside, which is where you would want to be anyway."

It was sensible advice, practically stated. But something in Katsuhito's tone suggested there might be more to it.

"You want me to establish myself there," Sheldon said. "Not just as someone staying at the shrine, but as someone with roots in the village."

Katsuhito's eyebrows rose slightly. "You are perceptive."

"You are not subtle. At least, not as subtle as you think you are."

For a moment, silence hung between them. Then Katsuhito's mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close.

"Perhaps not. But my reasoning is sound. A man with property is treated differently than a man without. If you intend to stay—and I believe you do—it would be wise to give the village reasons to accept you."

"Beyond just helping the shrine?"

"The shrine is my domain. The village is its own. The two overlap, but they are not the same." Katsuhito returned to his cooking. "Today, you should go to town. There is a bus in two hours. Buy supplies for the house—cleaning materials, basic necessities. The hardware store in Kurashiki will have what you need."

"Kurashiki?"

"The nearest town with proper shops. Forty minutes by bus." Katsuhito turned back briefly. "I have made a list."

---

Breakfast was rice, miso soup, and grilled fish—the standard morning fare that Sheldon was coming to appreciate for its simplicity and balance. Tenchi joined them partway through, stumbling into the kitchen with his hair wild and his eyes still half-closed.

"'Morning," the boy mumbled, dropping onto his cushion.

"Good morning, Tenchi." Sheldon pushed a bowl of rice toward him. "You look tired."

"I had a dream. A weird dream." Tenchi rubbed his eyes. "There was a lady in it. A lady with really long hair. She was sad."

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito, but the old man's expression revealed nothing.

"Dreams can be strange," Sheldon said carefully. "Do you remember anything else?"

Tenchi shook his head, already reaching for his chopsticks. "No. Just the lady. She was very pretty but very sad. Like she was waiting for something."

"Sometimes dreams are just dreams," Katsuhito said. His voice was calm, but something flickered in his eyes—something Sheldon could not quite identify. "Eat your breakfast. You have school."

The subject was closed. Sheldon filed the moment away, adding it to the growing collection of observations that suggested there was more to this place than met the eye.

---

The bus stop was a small shelter on the main road, barely large enough to accommodate a bench and a weathered schedule board. Sheldon arrived early, the list Katsuhito had provided tucked into his pocket along with money that seemed like more than he would need.

The rain had settled into a steady drizzle, not heavy enough to require an umbrella but persistent enough to dampen everything. Sheldon stood under the shelter's roof and watched the village wake up around him.

Masaki Village in the rain was a different place than Masaki Village in the sun. The colors were muted, the contrasts softer. Smoke rose from chimneys that had been cold the day before, residents seeking warmth against the damp chill. A farmer in a straw hat trudged along the road, leading a small tractor toward fields that would be too wet to work. A woman with a basket hurried past the bus stop, nodding briefly at Sheldon before disappearing into a shop whose door chimed as it opened.

People were starting to recognize him. Not warmly, not yet—he was still a stranger, still an oddity in a place where oddities were rare—but with the beginning of familiarity. He was becoming a known quantity, a fixture of the landscape rather than an anomaly passing through.

The bus arrived on time, a battered vehicle that looked older than some of the buildings it passed. The driver was a middle-aged man with a weathered face and patient eyes; he accepted Sheldon's fare without comment and gestured toward the seats behind him.

Sheldon found a place near the window and settled in to watch the landscape unfold.

---

The journey to Kurashiki took forty minutes of winding mountain roads.

The bus descended gradually from the highlands where Masaki Village nestled into the broader valley below. The terrain changed as they went: forests giving way to terraced fields, small clusters of houses becoming larger settlements, the road widening and straightening as it approached the town.

Sheldon watched it all with the attention of someone learning a new world. The rice paddies were flooded, their surfaces silver in the gray light, waiting for the planting season that would come in a few weeks. Farmers worked at the edges of fields, doing whatever farmers did to prepare for the growing season. An old man stood at the edge of one paddy, smoking a cigarette and watching the rain fall, his posture suggesting a lifetime of patient waiting.

The houses changed as the bus descended. Up in the mountains, they were traditional: wooden construction, tile roofs, the compact efficiency of homes built for climate and culture. Down in the valley, modernity began to intrude: concrete buildings, metal roofs, the occasional Western-style structure that looked out of place among its neighbors.

Other passengers boarded at stops along the way. An elderly woman with a shopping basket claimed the seat across the aisle from Sheldon, her eyes lingering on him for a moment before she turned away. She smelled of something floral—lavender, perhaps—and her hands, when they adjusted the basket on her lap, were spotted with age and work.

A young man in work clothes sat in the back, reading a newspaper whose headlines Sheldon could not quite make out from this distance. Something about the economy, probably. Japan in 1989 was at the peak of its bubble, drunk on prosperity that would not last. This young man, reading his newspaper with casual attention, had no idea that the world he knew was about to change.

A mother with a toddler struggled to manage both child and bags until Sheldon rose to help, earning a grateful smile and a bow of thanks. The toddler—a girl, perhaps two years old—stared at him with frank curiosity. 

In rural Japan in 1989, a Black man was an uncommon sight. Sheldon had understood this intellectually before arriving, but the reality of it was still sometimes jarring. Children stared openly, having not yet learned the polite avoidance that adults practiced. Adults glanced and looked away, their expressions ranging from curiosity to confusion to occasional wariness.

He smiled at the child, who hid behind her mother's leg and then peeked out again, giggling. This, at least, was universal: the game of peek-a-boo that transcended language and culture.

"She has not seen many foreigners," the mother said apologetically.

"It is fine. She is curious. Curiosity is good."

"You speak Japanese very well."

"Thank you. I had good teachers."

The conversation faded into comfortable silence, and Sheldon returned to watching the window as the bus approached Kurashiki.

The rain continued to fall, steady and patient, washing the landscape in shades of gray and green. It was the kind of rain that felt permanent, as though it had always been falling and always would be. Sheldon found himself oddly comforted by it. Rain was the same everywhere, in every time. This, at least, was something he understood.

---

The town was larger than he had expected.

Not a city by any means, but substantial: a proper downtown with shops and restaurants, a train station connecting it to the broader world, streets busy with cars and bicycles and pedestrians going about their daily business. After the quiet of Masaki Village, the activity felt almost overwhelming.

Sheldon stepped off the bus and stood for a moment, orienting himself.

Katsuhito's directions were clear: the hardware store was three blocks from the bus station, near the river. A simple route, easily followed. But Sheldon found himself wanting to wander first, to explore this town that would be his nearest connection to the wider world.

He had time. The bus back to Masaki did not leave for four hours.

The hardware store could wait.

---

Kurashiki's historic district was built around a canal lined with willows.

White-walled warehouses, dating back centuries, had been converted into shops and galleries and museums. Tourists wandered along the waterway, their umbrellas forming a colorful canopy against the gray sky. Tour boats glided past, their guides narrating the history of this place in voices that carried across the water.

Sheldon walked slowly, taking it all in.

The rain had driven most casual visitors indoors, leaving the canal relatively quiet. Water dripped from the willow branches, creating concentric ripples that spread and merged and disappeared. The white walls of the warehouses were striped with dark patterns where centuries of rain had left their marks. A crane—gray and elegant—stood motionless at the canal's edge, waiting for fish with the patience of its kind.

This was Japan as foreigners imagined it: picturesque, historic, preserved with careful attention to aesthetic detail. The reality of rural life—the dusty shops and aging infrastructure and slow decline of villages like Masaki—was nowhere in evidence. Here was beauty, curated and maintained for consumption.

And yet it was not entirely artificial. The buildings were genuinely old, their walls weathered by centuries of sun and rain. The canal had served real purposes once, moving goods and people before the age of automobiles. The willow trees had been planted by hands long since returned to earth, their descendants swaying in the spring breeze as they had for generations.

He stopped at a bridge that arched over the canal, leaning against the railing to watch the water flow. A tour boat passed beneath, the guide's voice carrying snatches of history: merchant families, rice trade, the Edo period when this town had been a center of commerce. The tourists in the boat looked up at him as they passed, probably wondering what a Black man was doing alone on a bridge in the rain.

He wondered the same thing, sometimes.

History was not just the past. It was the past continuing to live, layer upon layer, each generation adding to what came before.

Sheldon thought about his own layers now. A physicist from 2025. A man who had died in a laboratory accident. A body rebuilt in the image of youth. An identity constructed—or repurposed—from a family that no longer existed.

He was becoming part of history too. His presence here, in 1989, would ripple outward in ways he could not predict. Every conversation he had, every relationship he built, every small change he made to the world around him would become part of the fabric of time.

The thought was terrifying.

It was also liberating.

The bookstore was a narrow building wedged between a pottery shop and a gallery selling local art.

Inside, shelves stretched from floor to ceiling, crammed with volumes in Japanese and English and other languages Sheldon could not immediately identify. The smell of paper and ink filled the air, that particular perfume of accumulated knowledge that felt the same in every bookstore he had ever entered.

He browsed for nearly an hour.

The section on local history yielded three books he wanted: a comprehensive guide to Okayama Prefecture, a history of the shrines and temples in the region, and a slim volume on traditional crafts that included a chapter on woodworking techniques. The section on Japanese culture provided two more: a guide to Shinto practices and a book on seasonal festivals and their significance.

In the English section—smaller, clearly intended for tourists—he found something unexpected: a copy of Thoreau's *Walden*, its pages yellowed but intact.

He had read it in college, a lifetime ago. Had found it pretentious then, the musings of a privileged man playing at simplicity while his mother did his laundry. But now, standing in a bookstore in a country not his own, contemplating a life of deliberate isolation in a mountain shrine, the book felt different.

He bought it anyway.

The clerk was an elderly man with spectacles perched on his nose and the careful manner of someone who had spent his life surrounded by books.

"An interesting collection," he said, examining Sheldon's selections. "History. Religion. Crafts. Philosophy. You are trying to understand something."

"Several things, probably."

"That is how it begins. One question leads to another, which leads to another. Before you know it, you have a library." The old man smiled. "Do you read Japanese well, or just speak it?"

"I read it. Better than I expected to, actually."

"The mind has hidden depths. Sometimes we discover we know more than we thought we did." He wrapped the books in brown paper, his movements practiced and precise. "You are visiting Kurashiki?"

"I live in Masaki Village. I came for supplies."

"Masaki!" The clerk's eyebrows rose. "A quiet place. Beautiful, though. The shrine there is very old."

"You know it?"

"I visited once, many years ago. There was a ceremony—a wedding, I think. The priest was a formidable man. Sharp eyes. Very traditional."

"Katsuhito-san. He is still there."

"Is he? Good. Places like that need people who care for them. Otherwise..." He shrugged expressively. "You understand."

"I do."

Sheldon paid for the books and tucked them into his bag, adding their weight to the growing collection of things he was accumulating in this new life.

---

The hardware store was exactly where Katsuhito had said it would be: a substantial building near the river, its windows displaying tools and materials that ranged from traditional to modern.

Inside, the aisles were narrow but well-organized. Sheldon pulled out Katsuhito's list and began working through it systematically.

Cleaning supplies: buckets, brushes, cleaning solutions in bottles whose labels he had to read carefully to make sure he was getting the right products. The brands were unfamiliar—the future had not yet homogenized everything into a few global corporations—but the purposes were clear enough.

Basic tools: a saw, a hammer, chisels in various sizes, a plane for smoothing wood. The shrine had tools, but the property in the village would need its own set. A man should not have to borrow every time he needed to fix something.

Materials for repairs: wood putty for filling cracks, sandpaper in various grits, paint for the exterior trim, oil for preserving wood that had been neglected too long. The house would need work—he knew that from his brief visit—but with the right materials, it could be made livable again.

Bedding: a new futon set, because the one in the house had been sitting unused for years and was almost certainly home to things he did not want to share his sleep with. Cotton sheets, a pillow, a blanket for the cool nights.

The cart filled quickly. Sheldon added items that were not on the list but seemed necessary: a basic toolkit, a flashlight, batteries, a first aid kit. He had learned long ago that preparation was the difference between inconvenience and disaster.

The clerk who rang up his purchases was a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and the efficient manner of someone who had worked retail for decades.

"Setting up a new house?" she asked, tallying the items.

"Cleaning an old one. My family's property in Masaki Village."

"Ah, you are the Tsukino heir!" Her face brightened with recognition. "Ito-san at the grocery store mentioned you. She said you were polite and spoke good Japanese."

News traveled fast. Sheldon was beginning to understand the interconnected web of rural commerce, where shopkeepers knew each other and shared information about unusual customers.

"Ito-san was very helpful."

"She would be. Her mother grew up near Masaki. She considers it almost home." The clerk finished tallying and gave him the total. "The larger items—the lumber, the futon—we can deliver next week. Tuesday work for you?"

"Tuesday would be fine."

"We'll need an address."

Sheldon gave her the address of the Tsukino property, and she wrote it down carefully, confirming the characters twice to make sure she had it right.

"The old Tsukino General Store," she said. "I remember when it was open. My mother used to shop there when she visited relatives in Masaki. She said old Tsukino-san was very particular about his stock. Only carried the best."

"I did not know him well. We were distant relatives."

"Still. Family is family." She smiled, echoing Ito-san's words from days before. "Welcome to the area, Tsukino-san. I hope the house treats you well."

Lunch was udon at a small restaurant near the canal.

The restaurant was called "Tsuru-ya"—crane house—and a painted crane adorned the noren curtains that hung in the doorway. Inside, the space was warm and steamy, fragrant with dashi broth and the yeasty smell of fresh noodles. Sheldon removed his shoes at the entrance and was guided to a small table near the window by a server who barely glanced at his face.

The noodles were handmade—he could see the chef working in the open kitchen, rolling and cutting with practiced efficiency. When his order arrived, the noodles were thick and chewy, served in a broth that was rich with dashi and soy. Tempura on the side: shrimp and vegetables, crispy and light, the batter shattering at the touch of chopsticks. A simple meal, but satisfying in a way that went beyond mere nutrition.

The broth was particularly good. Sheldon found himself drinking every drop, tilting the bowl to get the last of it, the warmth spreading through his chest and pushing back the chill of the rainy day. His grandmother would have approved—she had always said that a good soup was medicine for both body and soul.

He ate slowly, watching the other diners.

The restaurant was crowded with locals on their lunch break: office workers in white shirts and dark ties, their jackets hung on hooks by the door; shopkeepers taking a rest from their counters, their aprons folded in their laps; elderly couples who had probably been eating here for decades, their conversation comfortable and unhurried.

A group of high school girls occupied a corner table, their uniforms matching and their laughter bright. They glanced at Sheldon occasionally, whispering to each other, probably speculating about who he was and what he was doing here. He pretended not to notice, which seemed to disappoint them slightly.

The conversation around him was a comfortable buzz, fragments of discussion about weather and business and family. Someone's daughter was getting married. Someone else's son had failed his university entrance exams. The economy was strong, the future was bright, and everyone seemed confident that tomorrow would be much like today.

He could follow most of it. His Japanese was better than it had been—better than it should have been, probably, another gift from whatever had reconstructed him. But there were still gaps, cultural references he did not catch, slang that dated to this specific moment in history.

He was an outsider here, in ways that went beyond his appearance.

But he was also, slowly, becoming less of one. Each meal he ate in a local restaurant, each purchase he made at a local shop, each conversation he had with a local person added a thread to the web that connected him to this place. He was building a life, one small interaction at a time.

When he paid his bill, the server—an older woman with a kind face—asked if he was enjoying his visit to Kurashiki.

"Very much. The udon was excellent."

"You should come back in spring," she said. "When the cherry blossoms bloom along the canal. It is very beautiful."

"I will try," he said. And meant it.

After lunch, he wandered through the historic district again, pausing at shops that caught his attention.

An antique store sold items that looked genuinely old: pottery from different eras, wooden furniture worn smooth by generations of use, scrolls with calligraphy he could not quite read. He browsed without buying, but the shopkeeper—a woman perhaps his grandmother's age—told him stories about some of the pieces, their origins and their journeys to this small store in Kurashiki.

"This bowl," she said, holding up a simple ceramic piece with an uneven glaze, "came from a temple in Kyoto. It was used for tea ceremonies for two hundred years before the temple closed. The monk who cared for it gave it to my grandmother as a gift, when she was young."

"It's beautiful," Sheldon said, and meant it. The bowl's imperfections—the slight wobble in its shape, the places where the glaze had pooled and darkened—gave it a character that a perfect piece would have lacked.

"Beauty and imperfection are the same thing, sometimes," the old woman said. "The Japanese call it wabi-sabi. The beauty of things that are incomplete, impermanent, imperfect." She smiled. "You understand, I think. You have that look."

"What look is that?"

"The look of someone who has learned that perfection is not always the goal."

Sheldon did not know how to respond to that, so he simply nodded and continued browsing. He found himself drawn to the older pieces, the ones with visible histories. A wooden chest with scratches on its surface, evidence of decades of use. A writing box whose lacquer had cracked with age, revealing the wood beneath. A pair of chopsticks, their tips worn smooth by countless meals.

Each item was a fragment of a life, a story condensed into physical form. Someone had eaten with those chopsticks, had stored treasures in that chest, had written letters and poems using that box. They were gone now, whoever they had been, but these objects remained, carrying their memory forward into a future they could not have imagined.

In the end, he bought the writing box. It cost more than he had intended to spend, but something about it called to him. Perhaps he would use it for its original purpose—he would need to write letters eventually, to establish himself in this world. Or perhaps he would simply keep it, a reminder that the past was never truly gone.

The old woman wrapped it carefully in cloth and paper, her movements practiced and precise.

"Take care of it," she said. "It has been waiting a long time for someone who understands."

A gallery nearby displayed local artists' work: landscapes mostly, scenes of the canal and the surrounding countryside rendered in watercolor and oil. Some were traditional in style, following conventions that dated back centuries. Others were more modern, experimenting with form and color in ways that would have been impossible in earlier eras.

Sheldon stood for a long time before a painting of mountains in mist, something in it capturing the quality of the view from the shrine, that sense of layers upon layers fading into distance. The artist had captured not just the appearance but the feeling of those mountains—the way they seemed to hold secrets, the way they made you feel small and ancient and temporary.

"You have good taste," a voice said behind him.

Sheldon turned to find a young man—perhaps thirty, dressed in paint-stained work clothes—watching him with curiosity.

"This is your work?"

"It is. Painted last autumn, from a spot about an hour north of here." The artist tilted his head. "You are not a tourist."

"I live in Masaki Village. At the shrine."

"Ah! I know that place. I painted there once, years ago. The great tree." He made a gesture suggesting something vast and ancient. "There is something about that tree. I could not capture it, no matter how hard I tried. The painting never looked right."

"Some things are difficult to capture."

"Yes. The most important things, usually." The artist smiled. "If you ever want your portrait painted, come find me. I have never painted a face quite like yours. It would be an interesting challenge."

Sheldon declined politely, but he took the artist's card—hand-printed, slightly smudged with ink—and tucked it into his pocket. Perhaps, someday.

He did not buy the painting. But he thought about it later, on the bus home.

---

The rain had strengthened by the time he boarded the return bus.

Sheldon found a seat by the window and watched the water stream down the glass, the landscape outside blurring into impressionist patches of green and gray. The bus was less crowded than the morning trip; most of the seats were empty, and the few other passengers sat in their own private silences.

He thought about time.

Thirty-six years. That was how far he had traveled, from the moment of his death in 2025 to this rainy afternoon in 1989. Thirty-six years of history that had not happened yet, of technologies that had not been invented, of events that had not occurred.

He knew things. Not everything—his knowledge of history was patchy at best, focused on scientific developments rather than political or cultural events—but he knew some things. He knew that the Berlin Wall would fall later this year, in November. He knew that Japan's economic bubble would burst within a few years, plunging the country into what they would eventually call the "Lost Decade." He knew about the internet, about smartphones, about the digital revolution that would reshape human society in ways that the people around him could not imagine.

He knew that planes would fly into buildings on a September morning in 2001, and that the world would never quite be the same afterward.

But what could he do with that knowledge?

The question had been nagging at him since he arrived, lurking beneath the surface of his thoughts. He had access to information that could, theoretically, be used to predict markets, to prepare for disasters, to change the course of events.

And yet.

He was one person, with limited resources and limited credibility. Even if he wanted to warn people about coming catastrophes, who would believe him? A Black man in rural Japan, claiming to know the future—he would be dismissed as crazy at best, investigated as suspicious at worst.

More importantly, he was not sure he should try to change things. The future he remembered had not been perfect, but it had been his future. The people he had known, the discoveries that had been made, the relationships that had formed—all of that had happened because history unfolded in a particular way. If he changed something, anything, he might erase the good along with the bad.

And there was another consideration, one that felt more personal.

He was not here to save the world. He was here to live a life.

Whatever had brought him to this place, whatever purpose the warmth intended for him, it did not feel like a mission to alter history. It felt like a gift: a second chance, a new beginning, an opportunity to build something meaningful in a world where he had nothing to lose and everything to gain.

The bus rounded a curve and Masaki Village came into view, nestled at the base of the mountain, small and quiet and waiting.

His grandmother's voice, unbidden: *Don't try to be a hero, baby. Just try to be good. The heroes in stories are always dying for their causes. The good folks, they stick around. They raise their children and tend their gardens and fix what's broken. That's worth more than any grand gesture.*

She had been talking about his father, he realized now. About the man who had died in a car accident when Sheldon was three, racing to something he thought was important, leaving behind a wife and child who needed him more than any emergency ever could.

Heroes died. Good folks stuck around.

Sheldon was going to try to be good.

---

Katsuhito met him at the bus stop with an umbrella.

"You found everything?"

"Everything on the list, and a few things that weren't." Sheldon held up the bag of books, heavy with his purchases. "Reading material."

"Ah. A man who reads. Good." The old man fell into step beside him as they walked toward the shrine steps. "Tenchi has been asking when you would return. I told him you would be back before dinner, but I am not certain he believed me."

"He worries."

"Yes. He does." Katsuhito's voice was soft, carrying undertones that Sheldon was learning to recognize. "He has reason to worry. People he loves have left and not come back."

"I came back."

"Today. Let us see if you continue to come back."

The words were testing, but the tone was not unkind. Katsuhito was protecting his grandson the only way he knew how: by not allowing hope to outpace evidence.

They climbed the steps in silence, the rain falling gently around them, the familiar path winding up through the forest. The trees were different in the rain, their leaves darker, their bark almost black with moisture. Steam rose where warm air met cold water, giving the forest an ethereal quality.

By the time they reached the top, Sheldon's legs were tired and his clothes were damp despite the umbrella Katsuhito had shared. But something that might have been happiness had settled into his chest, warm and unfamiliar.

Tenchi was waiting on the engawa, his face pressed against the screen, watching for their arrival.

"Tsukino-san!" He burst through the door and ran across the wet stones, bare feet splashing in puddles, throwing himself at Sheldon with complete abandon. "You came back! I told Usagi-chan you would come back and you did!"

Sheldon caught the boy automatically, lifting him out of the rain and holding him against his chest. The child was lighter than he expected, his small body warm against the chill of Sheldon's damp clothes.

"I told you I would be here when you got back from school."

"But you were gone when I got back! Grandpa said you went to town! I didn't know if you would come back from town!"

"I went to town, and I came back. That is what people do."

Tenchi pulled back enough to look at Sheldon's face, his expression intensely serious for a five-year-old. "Promise you will always come back?"

Sheldon considered lying. Considered giving the child the simple reassurance he so obviously needed. But his grandmother had taught him better than that.

"I cannot promise always. No one can promise always." He set the boy down gently, keeping one hand on his shoulder. "But I can promise that I will try. And I can promise that I will tell you if I have to go somewhere."

Tenchi's face scrunched in thought, processing this more complicated answer. Then he nodded slowly.

"Okay. That is a good promise. Grandpa says you should only make promises you can keep."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"You always say that!"

"Because it is always true."

---

Dinner that evening was the curry Sheldon had made the day before, reheated and served with fresh rice.

Tenchi had requested it specifically: "The Tsukino-san curry, not the Grandpa curry," which earned him a raised eyebrow from Katsuhito but no actual objection. The boy ate two helpings, declaring each one "the best curry" with an enthusiasm that suggested he had forgotten saying the same thing yesterday.

"Tell me about school," Sheldon said, as they ate. "What did you learn today?"

"We learned about fish. All the different kinds of fish. There's so many! Did you know there's a fish that can shock you like electricity?"

"Electric eels? Or perhaps torpedo rays?"

Tenchi's eyes went wide. "You know about them?"

"I know a little. Electric fish use special cells to generate electricity. Some use it to stun prey, some use it to navigate, some use it to communicate with other fish."

"Communicate? Fish can talk to each other?"

"In a way. Not with words like we use, but with electrical signals. It is like having a secret language that only other electric fish can understand."

Tenchi considered this, his chopsticks pausing halfway to his mouth. "That is very cool. I wish I could have a secret language."

"You do have one. Everyone does. The way you move your face, the sounds you make without words, the things you do without thinking about them. Other people learn to read those signals, and you learn to read theirs. It is a kind of language, even if you do not think of it that way."

The boy's face scrunched in concentration. "That is confusing."

"Most interesting things are, at first."

"That is so cool." The boy turned to his grandfather. "Grandpa, did you know about electric fish?"

"I have heard of them."

"Why didn't you tell me?"

"You did not ask."

Tenchi considered this, then shrugged and returned to his curry. "Tsukino-san knows about everything," he announced.

"Not everything. Just some things."

"You know about electric fish and Alaska and curry and secret languages. That is a lot of things."

"The world has many more things than that. I am still learning."

"Grown-ups still learn?"

"The best ones do. Learning does not stop when you finish school. It just changes shape."

Tenchi looked thoughtful, processing this information. Then: "Takeshi's older brother says learning is stupid and only babies go to school."

"Takeshi's older brother," Sheldon said carefully, "may find that the world is more complicated than he currently believes."

Katsuhito made a sound that might have been a suppressed laugh. Tenchi looked between them, clearly aware that something was funny but not sure what.

"Is Takeshi's brother going to be okay?" Tenchi asked, suddenly worried. "You sounded serious."

"He will be fine. Everyone has to learn in their own way, in their own time. Some people just take longer to figure out that learning is important."

"Oh." Tenchi seemed relieved. "Good. Takeshi would be sad if his brother was not okay. Even though his brother is annoying."

"That is how brothers work, I think. Annoying but important."

"Do you have a brother?"

The question caught Sheldon off guard. He had not thought about his family—his real family, the one in the future—in days. The answer came slowly.

"No. I was an only child."

"That sounds lonely."

"It was, sometimes. But I had my grandmother, and she was worth ten brothers."

Tenchi nodded seriously, accepting this. "Grandpa is worth ten grandpas. So I understand."

Katsuhito's eyebrow rose, but he said nothing. Sheldon suspected the old man was pleased, in his own understated way.

After dinner, the boy was sent to do his homework while the adults cleaned the kitchen. Katsuhito washed; Sheldon dried. They worked in comfortable silence for a while, the rhythm of the task creating its own kind of communication.

The kitchen felt smaller in the evening, more intimate. Steam from the wash water fogged the windows, making the outside world disappear. The sound of rain on the roof was constant, a reminder that the world beyond these walls was wet and cold, while here was warm and dry.

"You bought things in town," Katsuhito said. It was not quite a question.

"Supplies for the house. Cleaning materials, bedding, some tools. The larger items will be delivered next week."

"You are serious about making that place habitable."

"It seems wise. You said yourself—a man with property is treated differently."

Katsuhito nodded slowly, his hands still moving in the soapy water. "And books. I saw you brought books."

"History. Religion. Local knowledge." Sheldon dried a bowl and placed it in its cupboard. "I am trying to understand where I am."

"Understanding comes slowly."

"I know. But reading is a start."

They continued working in silence. A comfortable silence, the kind that did not need to be filled. Sheldon was learning that Katsuhito preferred this—the communication that happened between words, in gestures and glances and shared tasks.

"The trial period," Katsuhito said finally. "I am extending it."

Sheldon's stomach dropped. "I see."

"No, you do not." The old man's eyes met his, sharp and serious. "I am extending it because I want you to stay longer. Not because I am uncertain about you, but because I want to be certain about the arrangement before we make it permanent."

"Oh."

Relief flooded through him, unexpected in its intensity. He had not realized how much he had come to depend on this place, these people, until the possibility of losing them had appeared.

"A month. Stay for a month, work as you have been working, and at the end of it we will discuss terms for something more permanent." Katsuhito paused, hands still in the soapy water. "If that is acceptable."

"It is more than acceptable. Thank you."

"Do not thank me yet. A month is a long time. Many things can change." 

"But you believe they won't."

Katsuhito's eyebrow rose. "You are presumptuous."

"I am observant. There is a difference."

For a long moment, the old man simply looked at him. Then, unexpectedly, he smiled—a real smile, not the carefully measured expressions Sheldon had seen before.

"Perhaps there is," Katsuhito said. "Perhaps there is."

And when Tenchi came running in to show them a drawing he had made of electric fish—with lightning bolts shooting out of their mouths and a small human figure fleeing in terror—even Katsuhito laughed.

---

That night, in Kiyone's room, Sheldon opened one of the books he had bought.

The writing box from the antique store sat on the shelf beside his futon, its lacquered surface gleaming faintly in the lamplight. He had placed it there without thinking, as though it had always belonged in this room. Perhaps, in some strange way, it had. Perhaps everything was finding its place, himself included.

The history of Okayama Prefecture was dry and academic, but it was filled with details about the region he now called home. He read about the geography—mountains and rivers and the Inland Sea that connected Japan to the wider world. About the climate—hot summers, mild winters, the rainy season that would arrive in a few months and would test every roof and gutter he had repaired. About the traditional industries—rice cultivation, fishing, crafts that had been practiced for centuries.

The chapter on local shrines and temples was particularly interesting. It described the relationship between communities and their sacred spaces, the way shrines had served as centers of social and spiritual life for generations. The rituals that marked the passage of the year. The festivals that brought communities together. The quiet, daily practices that kept the sacred alive in an increasingly secular world.

The Masaki Shrine was mentioned briefly, a single paragraph noting its age and its connection to a local family that had maintained it for generations. Nothing remarkable, nothing that would draw attention from the casual reader.

But Sheldon knew there was more to this place than a single paragraph could capture. He had felt it in the great tree that dominated the shrine grounds, the warmth he sensed when he stood before it. In the way Katsuhito moved with the careful precision of someone trained for more than sweeping paths. In Tenchi's dream of a sad woman with long hair, a dream the old man had dismissed too quickly.

He thought about Tenchi's dream as he read. A woman with long hair, very pretty but very sad, waiting for something. It could have been nothing—children had strange dreams all the time, and a boy who had lost his mother might dream of women for reasons that had nothing to do with anything supernatural.

But in a world where Sheldon himself had died and been reborn, where some force had reconstructed his body and dropped him in the past, where a tree radiated warmth that had nothing to do with temperature...

Perhaps not all dreams were just dreams.

There were secrets here. Mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

He thought about the system, silent since that first moment in the field. The warmth that wrapped around him when he slept, offering no explanations, no guidance, no answers to questions that multiplied faster than he could formulate them. Was it testing him? Waiting for something? Simply absent, its work done?

He did not know. He could not know. All he could do was live the life he had been given and trust that understanding would come in its own time.

The second book—the one on Shinto practices—proved equally interesting. He read about kami, the spirits that inhabited all things: trees and rivers, mountains and storms, even human-made objects that had accumulated significance through use. He read about the rituals used to honor these spirits, the offerings and prayers and festivals that kept the relationship between humans and kami alive.

It was a different way of seeing the world than he was used to. His scientific training had taught him to look for mechanisms, for cause and effect, for explanations that could be tested and verified. But Shinto did not seem to require that kind of understanding. It simply acknowledged that the world was full of presences, of forces and entities that humans could relate to even if they could not fully comprehend them.

Perhaps that was not so different from physics, at its deepest level. The quantum world was full of phenomena that defied intuition, that could be described mathematically but never truly understood. Particles that existed in multiple states simultaneously. Forces that operated across distances that should have precluded any connection. The universe, at its foundations, was strange in ways that science was only beginning to appreciate.

Maybe the kami were another way of describing that strangeness. Another framework for relating to forces beyond human comprehension.

Or maybe they were something else entirely. Something that his old worldview had no category for.

He read until his eyes grew heavy, then set the book aside and lay back on the futon. Rain still pattered against the screens, a soft percussion that made the silence feel comfortable rather than empty.

Four days. He had been here four days.

It felt like longer. It felt like no time at all.

Tomorrow he would go to the property in the village and begin the work of making it habitable. Tomorrow he would take another step toward building a life in this place that had somehow become his home.

But tonight, he would rest. Tonight, he would let the rain sing him to sleep and trust that tomorrow would bring whatever it was meant to bring.

The warmth found him as consciousness faded, wrapping around him like a blanket woven from starlight. It asked nothing. It demanded nothing. It simply was, present and patient and waiting.

Sheldon let himself sink into it and slept without dreams.

## Day 5

---

## Friday, April 7, 1989

---

Sheldon woke to sunlight and the sound of birds arguing.

Not singing—arguing. Two of them, perched somewhere just outside his window, exchanging sharp calls in a pattern that sounded distinctly like a disagreement. He lay in the futon and listened, trying to identify the species by their voices alone.

His grandmother would have known. She had grown up on a farm in rural Georgia, and she could name every bird that visited her feeder by sight or sound. She had tried to teach him, during those long summer visits when he was young enough to think that knowing things was more important than understanding them. He had memorized the names dutifully—cardinal, blue jay, mockingbird, wren—but the knowledge had faded over the years, replaced by equations and theoretical frameworks that seemed more important at the time.

Now, in this new life, he found himself wishing he had paid more attention.

The birds concluded their dispute and flew off, their calls fading into the general morning chorus. Sheldon rose, folded his futon with the precision that had become habit, and went to greet the day.

---

The kitchen was already busy when he arrived.

Katsuhito stood at the stove, his attention divided between a pot of rice and something sizzling in a pan. Tenchi was already at the table, still in his pajamas, his hair sticking up in three different directions. The boy looked up when Sheldon entered, and his face split into a grin.

"Tsukino-san! Today is Friday!"

"I am aware."

"Friday means tomorrow is Saturday. Saturday means no school. No school means I can help you all day!"

Sheldon settled onto his cushion and accepted the cup of tea Katsuhito placed before him. The old man's expression suggested that he had already heard this reasoning several times this morning.

"That is true," Sheldon said carefully. "Though helping all day is quite a lot of helping. Perhaps we should discuss what you might help with."

"Everything! I want to help with everything." Tenchi bounced on his cushion, apparently too excited to sit still. "Can we go to the house today? Can I see the room with the pictures? Can I help clean? Can I—"

"Eat your breakfast," Katsuhito said, setting a bowl of rice and a plate of grilled fish in front of the boy. "Plans can wait until stomachs are full."

"But Grandpa—"

"Eat."

Tenchi subsided with theatrical reluctance, but his eyes kept darting to Sheldon between bites, communicating volumes of barely contained enthusiasm.

Breakfast was the same simple fare that had defined every morning of the past week: rice, fish, pickled vegetables, miso soup. The repetition should have been boring, but Sheldon found it comforting. There was wisdom in routines. They anchored you to the present, provided structure when everything else was uncertain.

He ate slowly, savoring each element, watching the interplay between grandfather and grandson. Katsuhito corrected Tenchi's posture three times—"Sit up straight, you are not a sack of rice"—and reminded him twice to chew with his mouth closed. The corrections were delivered without heat, part of an ongoing campaign that both parties seemed to accept as normal.

"I have been thinking," Katsuhito said, after Tenchi had finally cleared his plate. "About the house."

Sheldon set down his chopsticks. "Yes?"

"You cannot do all the work yourself. The cleaning, yes. The basic repairs, yes. But the tatami will need replacing, and the roof should be inspected properly, and the plumbing..." He shook his head. "There are people in the village who do this work. Craftsmen. It would be wise to consult them."

"I had planned to do as much as I could myself."

"A reasonable plan, for someone with your skills. But there is a difference between capable and qualified. For certain work—work that must be done correctly or the house will fail—you should hire professionals."

Sheldon considered this. In his old life, he would have researched contractors online, read reviews, compared prices. Here, in this time and place, the process would be different. Word of mouth. Personal recommendations. Trust built through community connections he did not yet have.

"Would you be willing to make introductions?"

"I would." Katsuhito's expression suggested this was the answer he had hoped to hear. "There is a roofer in the village—Tanaka. His family has been doing this work for generations. And for the tatami, there is only one person worth consulting: Hashimoto, in Kurashiki. He supplies the shrine. His work is excellent."

"I appreciate the guidance."

"Guidance is free. The craftsmen are not." A hint of amusement in the old man's eyes. "Do you have the resources for this kind of work?"

Sheldon had been avoiding this question, even in his own mind. The bank account the system had provided seemed substantial, but he had no real sense of how far it would stretch. He had been spending cautiously, uncertain of when—or if—he would be able to earn more.

"I believe so. For essential repairs, at least."

"Good. Then we will begin with introductions. But not today." Katsuhito rose, gathering dishes. "Today, you clean. Tomorrow, you meet Tanaka. Sunday, perhaps, if the weather holds, we assess what the roof truly needs."

---

The morning work at the shrine had become a comfortable routine.

Sheldon started with the tasks Katsuhito had outlined: clearing debris from the drainage channels that ran along the edges of the main buildings, checking the condition of the stone lanterns that lined the approach, sweeping the main courtyard clear of the leaves and twigs that accumulated daily.

The drainage channels were an ongoing concern. The shrine sat on a mountainside, which meant water was constantly trying to find its way downhill. Without proper channels to guide it, that water would undermine foundations, rot wood, and turn paths into mudslides. Keeping the channels clear was not glamorous work, but it was essential.

He crawled along the length of each channel, removing leaves and twigs and the occasional small animal that had found its way in and not found its way out. A dead mouse in one section, already decomposing. A frog, still alive, which he relocated to the forest with a gentle nudge. The accumulated detritus of nature's endless cycle.

His grandmother had kept drainage channels around her house too—simpler than these, just shallow trenches lined with gravel—and she had taught him to clean them every spring. "Water's patient," she had said. "It'll find a way through eventually. But if you give it an easy path, it'll take that instead of the hard one."

The stone lanterns were next. There were seven of them along the main approach, ranging from modest to substantial, their shapes weathered by decades of exposure. Some were cracked, hairline fractures that let water in to freeze and expand in winter. He noted each one, planning repairs that would need to happen before the cold weather returned.

The largest lantern, near the torii gate, had shifted slightly on its base. Not enough to be dangerous, but enough to notice. He examined it carefully, trying to understand what had caused the movement. Settling foundation? Root pressure from a nearby tree? The slow creep of geology over years?

He would need to mention it to Katsuhito. This was the kind of thing that got worse if ignored, and worse faster than anyone expected.

The courtyard sweeping was almost meditative—long, slow strokes with a bamboo broom, gathering debris into piles, collecting the piles into a basket for disposal. The rhythm was hypnotic, the physical motion freeing his mind to wander.

He thought about the house in the village—what it would take to make it livable, what it might become once the work was done. He thought about the people Katsuhito had mentioned—Tanaka the roofer, Hashimoto the tatami maker—and wondered what they would make of the stranger who had inherited Tsukino Hideo's property.

He thought about the repair shop idea that had begun to crystallize in his mind. A place where people could bring things that needed fixing. A service the village had lost when Hideo got too old to continue. A way to be useful, to be needed, to build connections in a community that was still deciding whether to accept him.

And he thought, as he often did, about his grandmother.

She would have loved this, he realized. The quiet morning, the useful work, the sense of belonging to a place that needed tending. She had spent her whole life tending things—her garden, her house, her community, the grandson who showed up every summer with a suitcase full of books and too many questions. She had never seemed to resent the work, never complained about the endless cycle of maintenance and repair that defined rural life.

"There's always something that needs doing," she had told him once, when he asked why she spent so much time on tasks that would only need to be done again. "That's not a burden—that's a blessing. It means you're needed. It means you have a purpose."

He had not understood then. He had been young, ambitious, certain that purpose meant discoveries and publications and the advancement of human knowledge. Fixing a fence or weeding a garden had seemed like a waste of time, maintenance that distracted from more important work.

Now, scraping moss from the cracks between flagstones, he understood.

---

Tenchi found him near the main hall, apparently having completed whatever morning tasks Katsuhito had assigned.

"Are you done yet?" the boy asked, bouncing from foot to foot.

"Almost. I need to finish these stones, and then check the gutters on the storage building."

"That sounds boring."

"Most maintenance work is boring. That does not make it less important."

Tenchi considered this philosophical point with the seriousness he brought to all new information. "Grandpa says that too. He says boring work is still work, and work is how we take care of the things that matter."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"You always say that."

"Because it is always true."

The boy settled onto a nearby stone, apparently content to watch Sheldon work. He had brought Kabutaro in his jar, and the beetle provided a focus for a running commentary about the insect's opinions on various topics.

"Kabutaro thinks the stones look better without the moss. He says moss is for forests, not for shrines."

"I agree with Kabutaro."

"But he also says that you are working too slowly. He says if he had hands, he could do it faster."

"Kabutaro is welcome to try. Although I suspect his hands—or rather, his legs—are not well-suited to this particular task."

Tenchi peered into the jar, as though consulting with his pet. "He says he was joking. He knows you are doing your best."

"That is gracious of him."

The beetle, for its part, remained exactly as expressionless as beetles always were. But Sheldon had learned not to underestimate the depth of meaning Tenchi could extract from a creature with no apparent capacity for communication.

They worked in companionable near-silence for a while, Sheldon scraping and sweeping while Tenchi provided commentary on behalf of Kabutaro. The morning warmed as the sun rose higher, and by the time Sheldon finished the last of the stones, both of them were ready for a break.

"Lunch?" Tenchi asked hopefully.

"Lunch," Sheldon agreed.

---

They ate on the engawa, rice balls that Sheldon had prepared earlier and pickled vegetables from the jar in the kitchen. The view stretched down over the forest and the village below, the landscape softened by the haze of a warm spring day.

"Can we go to the house now?" Tenchi asked, between bites.

"After lunch. And after you help clean up."

"I always help clean up."

"Then this should be easy."

The boy finished his rice ball in three large bites—earning a distant correction from Katsuhito, who was apparently monitoring from inside—and immediately began gathering empty containers. His enthusiasm for the task was transparently strategic, but Sheldon appreciated the effort nonetheless.

They walked down together, just the two of them this time. Katsuhito had work at the shrine that could not be postponed, but he had given his approval for the afternoon expedition.

"Be back before dark," he had said. "And do not let Tenchi lift anything heavy."

"I can lift heavy things!" Tenchi had protested.

"You can lift things that seem heavy to you. That is not the same."

The boy had accepted this distinction with the reluctance of someone who knew he was being outwitted but could not quite identify how.

The three hundred steps were easier now, Sheldon's body continuing to adapt to the daily routine. Tenchi raced ahead, then circled back, then raced ahead again, his energy apparently unlimited by the constraints that affected adult bodies.

"Why do you walk so slow?" he called back from twenty steps ahead.

"I walk at a sustainable pace. You run in bursts and then have to rest."

"I do not have to rest!"

"You will by the time we reach the bottom."

Tenchi took this as a challenge, of course, and spent the rest of the descent proving that he could maintain his pace without stopping. He arrived at the bottom slightly out of breath and visibly triumphant.

"See? I did not rest."

"You are breathing heavily."

"That is different from resting."

Sheldon decided not to argue the point.

---

The village was busier on their return, late afternoon bringing people out for errands before shops closed for the evening.

As they passed Ito-san's grocery store, the shopkeeper called out from her doorway.

"Tsukino-san! A moment?"

Sheldon paused, gesturing for Tenchi to wait. The boy found a low wall to sit on, apparently content to rest after the afternoon's exertions.

"I heard you were at the house today," Ito-san said. Her tone was conversational, but her eyes were sharp with curiosity. "People are talking."

"I imagine they are."

"They are wondering what you intend to do with it. Whether you will live there, or sell it, or..." She let the sentence trail off, inviting him to fill in the gap.

"I intend to restore it," Sheldon said. "To make it livable again. Beyond that, I am still considering my options."

"Options." She nodded, processing this. "Some of the older residents remember Hideo-san's shop. What it was like when it was open. They miss having a place like that in the village."

"What kind of shop was it?"

"General goods, mostly. But Hideo-san was handy—he would fix things for people too. Small repairs, nothing fancy. Useful things." Her expression shifted into something like hope. "There has not been anyone like that since he closed. People have to go to the city now for repairs."

Sheldon thought about the conversation with Katsuhito the night before. The tinker who had traveled from town to town, fixing things. The respect such a person had earned. The gap that had been left when he died.

"I have been thinking about something similar," he admitted. "A repair shop, perhaps. Somewhere people could bring things that need fixing."

Ito-san's face lit up. "That would be... that would be very welcome, Tsukino-san. Very welcome indeed."

"It is just an idea, for now. The house needs a great deal of work before it could be used for anything."

"Of course, of course. But if you do decide to open something—please, let me know. I will spread the word."

"I will. Thank you, Ito-san."

"And thank you. For bringing life back to that place. It has been sad, seeing it empty."

---

They were almost to the shrine steps when another voice called out.

"Masaki-kun!"

An elderly man was approaching from a side street, moving with the careful steps of someone whose joints no longer cooperated fully. He was dressed in work clothes—simple but clean—and carried a wooden cane that he clearly needed for support.

"Nakamura-san!" Tenchi ran to meet him. "Are you okay? You look tired."

"I am always tired, child. That is what happens when you get old." But the man's voice was warm, his eyes crinkling with affection. "I heard your grandfather has a visitor. This must be him."

Sheldon bowed politely. "Tsukino Sheldon. Pleased to meet you."

"Nakamura Kenji. I knew your... relative, I suppose. Hideo-san."

"You knew him?"

"We were friends, once. When we were both younger and had more time for friendship." The old man studied Sheldon with interest. "You do not look like him."

"I am a distant connection. Very distant."

"So I assumed. Still, it is good that someone has come to claim what he left behind. He worried, toward the end, about what would happen to the house."

"Did you see him often? Before he died?"

"Not as often as I should have. He kept to himself, those last years. Would not accept help even when he needed it." A shadow crossed the old man's face. "Pride, perhaps. Or shame at needing help at all. Hard to say."

"I am sorry you lost your friend."

"As am I. But that is the nature of old age—watching friends leave, one by one, until you are the only one left standing." He shook off the melancholy with visible effort. "But enough of that. The boy tells me you are fixing up the house?"

"Starting to. It will take time."

"Good. Good things usually do." Nakamura-san nodded firmly. "If you need stories—about the house, about Hideo-san, about the village as it used to be—come find me. I am usually in the garden, if these old bones will allow."

"I would like that very much."

They parted with bows, Nakamura-san continuing on his slow way, Sheldon and Tenchi turning toward the shrine steps.

"He's nice," Tenchi said. "But also sad."

"Many old people are both. They have seen more than young people, learned more, lost more. It is hard to carry all of that without some sadness."

"Will you be sad when you get old?"

"Probably. But hopefully I will also be happy, sometimes. That is all anyone can ask for—moments of happiness between the sad parts."

"That sounds like something Grandpa would say."

"I take that as a compliment."

---

The house looked the same as it had on his first visit: old, neglected, waiting.

Tenchi approached cautiously, his earlier enthusiasm tempered by the reality of the building's condition. The weathered wood, the dusty windows, the weeds growing through cracks in the paving stones—all of it spoke to years of abandonment.

"It looks sad," the boy said quietly.

"Sad?"

"Like it is waiting for someone to come home. But no one comes."

Sheldon looked at the house through Tenchi's eyes and saw what he meant. There was something mournful about empty buildings, a quality that had nothing to do with their physical condition. Houses were meant to be lived in. When they weren't, they seemed to know.

"Someone is coming now," he said. "I am going to make it a home again."

"Promise?"

"I promise to try."

Tenchi considered this, then nodded. "Trying is important. Grandpa says that people who do not try cannot succeed. But people who try might."

"Your grandfather is—"

"Wise. I know. You always say that." But the boy was smiling.

---

They started with the back rooms, which they had not touched during the previous visit.

The layout was simple: the main shop space at the front, a small kitchen and storage area behind, and two rooms upstairs that had served as living quarters. Yesterday they had focused on the shop space, sweeping and airing it out. Today, Sheldon wanted to assess the rest.

The kitchen was small but functional. A traditional Japanese layout: a place for the portable stove, a preparation area, storage cabinets built into the walls. Everything was covered in dust, the accumulated grime of years without occupants, but the structure underneath seemed sound.

He ran his hand along the walls, feeling for soft spots that might indicate water damage or rot. The plaster was intact, cool and smooth beneath his fingers. The wood of the cabinets was solid, old-growth timber that had been cured properly before use. Tsukino Hideo had known what he was doing when he maintained this house.

"It smells funny," Tenchi observed.

"Old houses have their own smell. Dust and wood and time."

"Time has a smell?"

"In a way. When things sit long enough without being disturbed, they develop a particular quality. Your nose learns to recognize it."

Tenchi sniffed experimentally. "I think it smells like the storage room at the shrine. The one with all the old festival things."

"That is probably the same smell. Age and dust and objects waiting to be used again."

Sheldon opened cabinets methodically, cataloging their contents. Most were empty, their previous contents cleared out by whoever had handled Hideo's affairs after his death. But a few held remnants: a set of cooking chopsticks, their tips darkened with use. A ceramic bowl with a chip in the rim. A tin that had once held tea, its label faded to illegibility. A small ceramic jar that, when opened, proved to contain desiccated pickles long past any reasonable consumption date.

"Yuck!" Tenchi recoiled from the jar. "That smells terrible!"

"That is what happens to food left too long. It was probably fine when it was sealed, years ago."

"Why would anyone leave food?"

Sheldon considered the question. "When someone dies, the people who clean up after them do not always check everything. They take the obvious things—clothes, valuables, papers. Small items in cabinets get overlooked."

"That's sad."

"It is. But it also tells us something about how Hideo-san lived. He made pickles. He kept them in this particular jar, in this particular cabinet. Small details, but they help us understand him."

Tenchi nodded solemnly, apparently accepting this as another piece of the ongoing lesson in how adults understood the world.

The storage area behind the kitchen was more cluttered. Shelves lined the walls, holding a miscellaneous collection of items: old newspapers tied in bundles, wooden crates that had once held vegetables, broken tools waiting for repairs that had never come, fabric scraps folded neatly as though someone had intended to use them for something.

"What's this?" Tenchi had found something in a corner, half-hidden behind a cabinet.

Sheldon crossed to look. It was a wooden box, roughly the size of a large book, its surface dusty but its construction solid. He lifted it carefully, feeling the weight, and carried it to where the light was better.

Inside, wrapped in cloth that had once been white but had yellowed with age, was a set of carpentry tools.

Not the cheap mass-produced tools he had bought in Kurashiki, but hand-forged instruments of obvious quality. Chisels with edges that still looked sharp. A small plane, its wooden body smooth from decades of handling. Measuring implements marked in traditional units. A saw with a blade so thin it was almost translucent, designed for cuts of surgical precision.

"These belonged to Hideo-san," Sheldon said, more to himself than to Tenchi. "These were his tools."

He lifted one of the chisels, feeling the balance, examining the craftsmanship. The blade was still true, the edge still clean. The handle was wrapped in leather that had darkened with age and use, conforming to the shape of the hand that had held it countless times.

Tools like these were not purchased casually. They were acquired over a lifetime, selected for specific purposes, maintained with religious devotion. A craftsman's tools were an extension of his ability, and these tools spoke of serious skill.

"Can you use them?" Tenchi asked.

"I... maybe. With practice." Sheldon set the chisel back in its place, handling it with the respect it deserved. "These are very fine tools. Better than anything I could buy. They require knowledge I do not fully have."

"But you can learn?"

"I can learn. That is what tools like these are for—to be learned from, to be mastered over years of practice."

"Then you should keep them."

"I intend to. And I will try to be worthy of them."

---

They cleaned for three hours, working through the kitchen and the storage area and then moving upstairs.

The upper floor was in better condition than Sheldon had expected. The two rooms had been living spaces—one for sleeping, one that seemed to have served as a combination study and sitting area. Both were dusty but structurally sound, their tatami mats faded but not yet ruined.

"This is where he lived," Tenchi said, with something like awe in his voice. "All by himself."

"Yes. For many years, after his wife died."

"Wasn't he lonely?"

Sheldon considered the question. "Probably, sometimes. But some people prefer solitude. It is not the same as being lonely."

"Grandpa says he likes solitude. But I think he gets lonely sometimes too. That's why he lets me talk so much."

"You might be right."

They swept and dusted, opened windows to let in air that had been stale for years, assessed what could be saved and what would need to be replaced. The tatami in the sleeping room was beyond salvaging—soft with age and spotted with what might have been mildew or might have been something worse. But the tatami in the other room was merely faded, potentially usable if properly cleaned.

The photographs were still where Sheldon had left them on his first visit, arranged on the low shelf near the window. Tenchi studied them with interest.

"Is that him? Hideo-san?"

"That's him when he was young. And this is probably his wife, and this their son."

"They look happy."

"Photographs usually show people looking happy. That was the point of taking them—to remember the good times."

"Do you have photographs? Of your family?"

Sheldon's chest tightened. "Not anymore. They were lost."

Tenchi absorbed this information with the gravity children brought to adult sorrows they did not fully understand. "That's sad. You should get new photographs. Of us. Of Grandpa and me and you. Then you'll have a family again."

The words hit harder than Tenchi could have known. A family again. As though it were that simple, as though people could be substituted one for another, as though the ache of loss could be healed by new connections.

And yet.

"Maybe you're right," Sheldon said quietly. "Maybe I should."

---

Around three o'clock, they took a break, sitting on the back step and sharing the water Sheldon had brought from the shrine.

The courtyard behind the house was a disaster—overgrown with weeds, choked with debris, whatever garden had once existed completely buried under years of neglect. But Sheldon could see the bones of it: the stone border that had defined the beds, the remains of a small pond now silted in, the ghost of a path leading to what might have been a work area in the back.

"This could be nice," Tenchi said, following Sheldon's gaze. "With flowers and stuff."

"It could. It will take a lot of work."

"I like work. Work is how we take care of things that matter." The boy recited this like a mantra, something he had been taught to repeat.

"Your grandfather again?"

"Mom, actually. She said that." Tenchi's voice was matter-of-fact, the way children sometimes talked about the dead when they had processed enough of the grief to speak casually. "She used to work in the garden at the shrine. Before she got sick."

Sheldon waited, not pushing, letting the boy share at his own pace.

"She grew vegetables. And flowers. The prettiest flowers. Grandpa kept some of them alive after she died, but not all of them. He says he doesn't have her touch."

"It takes skill to grow things well. Not everyone has it."

"Mom had it. She could make anything grow." A pause. "I hope I have it too. But I won't know until I try."

"Would you like to help with this garden? When I get to it?"

Tenchi's face lit up. "Really?"

"Really. It will take a while—the house comes first—but eventually I want to restore the garden. Having help would be good."

"I'll help! I'll help every day! I'll be the best helper!"

"Let's start with 'sometimes' and see how it goes from there."

---

The climb back up the three hundred steps was harder in the late afternoon, tiredness settling into legs that had already done a full day's work.

Tenchi, who had been convinced of his inexhaustible energy earlier, was noticeably slower now. He still chattered as they climbed—about the house, about the tools they had found, about what he wanted to do tomorrow—but there were longer pauses between bursts of speech.

"Are you tired?" Sheldon asked, around step two hundred.

"No!"

"Your legs seem to think otherwise."

"My legs are fine. My legs are very strong."

"I see."

They continued in silence for another fifty steps. Then Tenchi asked, in a smaller voice:

"Would you carry me? Just for a little while?"

Sheldon stopped and crouched, letting the boy climb onto his back. Tenchi wrapped his arms around Sheldon's neck and his legs around his waist, settling into place with the practiced ease of a child who had been carried before.

"Do not tell Grandpa," Tenchi said. "He says I am too old to be carried."

"I will not tell."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

They continued up the steps, Sheldon's legs protesting the added weight but his heart warming at the trust implied. Tenchi's head settled against his shoulder, the boy's breathing gradually evening out as exhaustion caught up with him.

By the time they reached the top, Tenchi was asleep.

---

Katsuhito met them at the entrance to the house, his expression shifting from neutral to something softer when he saw the sleeping child.

"He wore himself out," Sheldon said quietly.

"He does that. He has more energy than sense." But there was affection in the words, not criticism. "I will put him to bed. He can have a proper bath in the morning."

He lifted Tenchi from Sheldon's back with the ease of long practice, cradling the boy against his chest. Tenchi stirred but did not wake, his arms wrapping automatically around his grandfather's neck.

"Thank you," Katsuhito said. "For taking him. For including him."

"He is good company."

"He is. Though he does not always know when to stop." The old man turned toward the house, then paused. "Dinner in an hour. You should rest."

Sheldon nodded and watched them go, grandfather and grandson disappearing into the house that had become, improbably, a kind of home.

He used the hour to wash up and change clothes, then sat on the engawa with one of his books.

The evening was mild, the air carrying the scent of spring flowers and distant cooking. The great tree dominated the landscape, its branches dark against the fading sky. Birds settled into its canopy, their calls gradually quieting as dusk approached.

The tree seemed different every time he looked at it. Not physically—it was always the same massive trunk, the same spreading branches, the same rope marking its sacred status—but in feeling. Sometimes it felt ancient and indifferent, like a mountain or an ocean, too vast to care about human concerns. Other times it felt watchful, aware, as though something behind those layers of bark was paying attention.

Tonight it felt... welcoming. Like a grandfather settling into a chair by the fire, inviting others to sit and share the warmth.

He was projecting, probably. Reading meaning into patterns that were really just patterns. But he could not quite shake the sense that the tree knew he was there, and approved.

He was reading the Marcus Aurelius—the old translation he had found in the Kurashiki bookshop. The pages were foxed and the binding was loose, but the words still held power.

*When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive—to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love.*

He had read these words before, in another life. Had agreed with them intellectually without feeling them viscerally. Now, sitting on a wooden porch in rural Japan, breathing air that smelled of cedar and possibility, he understood.

*Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.*

His grandmother had said something similar, in her own way. "Don't talk about being good—be good. Actions speak. Words are just air."

She had lived that philosophy. Had never preached or lectured or made grand pronouncements about morality. Had simply done the right thing, day after day, until doing the right thing became so natural that people forgot it was a choice.

Could he live that way? Could he become the kind of person who did not need to think about being good because goodness had become automatic?

He did not know. But he could try.

Every morning was a gift. Every breath was borrowed time. Every moment of peace was something to be treasured, not squandered.

He had died. He had been given a second chance. He would not waste it.

---

Dinner was fish and rice and vegetables, prepared by Katsuhito with his usual efficiency.

The meal was simple—grilled mackerel, rice that had been cooking since late afternoon, pickled vegetables from a jar in the cold storage—but Sheldon had come to appreciate the elegance of simplicity. Every element was necessary. Nothing was wasted. The flavors complemented each other without competing.

Tenchi had woken enough to eat, though his usual energy was dimmed by tiredness. He sat quietly through most of the meal, contributing only the occasional observation about the day's activities.

"We found tools," he told his grandfather. "Old tools, in a box. Tsukino-san says they were the carpenter's tools."

"Hideo-san was known for his carpentry," Katsuhito confirmed. "Before he ran the shop, he built things. Houses, furniture. He was skilled."

"Very skilled, from what I could tell. The tools are exceptional quality."

"He learned from his father, who learned from his father. Traditional techniques, passed down through generations." Katsuhito paused to pick a bone from his fish. "Such knowledge is becoming rare. Young people want modern tools, modern methods. They do not have patience for the old ways."

"The old ways often produced better results."

"Sometimes. Not always. But they produced results with more care. More attention. More understanding of the materials and the process." The old man's eyes met Sheldon's. "Do you think he would mind if I used his tools?"

"I think he would prefer they be used rather than sit in a box. Tools that are not used lose their edge. Skills that are not practiced fade."

"Then I will try to honor them."

"Good."

Tenchi yawned enormously, his jaw cracking with the force of it.

"Bed," Katsuhito said. "No arguments."

"But I'm not—" Another yawn interrupted the protest. "...okay. Maybe a little bit tired."

He trudged off toward his room, pausing at the doorway to look back.

"Thank you for today, Tsukino-san. I had fun."

"So did I. Sleep well, Tenchi."

"You too."

After dinner, Sheldon helped clean up, washing dishes while Katsuhito dried, falling into the rhythm of shared labor. The kitchen was quiet except for the splash of water and the soft clink of ceramics being stacked.

"The boy enjoyed himself," Katsuhito observed.

"He is good company. Energetic, but thoughtful."

"He asks too many questions."

"Questions are how people learn. My grandmother encouraged me to ask questions, even when the answers were uncomfortable."

"Your grandmother sounds like a wise woman."

"She was. I miss her."

They finished the dishes in silence, the confession hanging in the air between them. It was the most personal thing Sheldon had revealed, and he was not sure why he had said it. Something about the quiet evening, perhaps. Something about the trust that was slowly building.

"Loss shapes us," Katsuhito said finally. "We can let it break us, or we can let it strengthen us. There is no third option."

"Which did you choose?"

The old man was quiet for a long moment.

"I chose to survive. For Tenchi. For the shrine. For the memory of those who trusted me to carry on." He set down the dish towel with precise care. "Some days, survival is all we can manage. That is enough."

"Yes. It is."

"The house," Katsuhito said, when the last dish was put away. "How does it look?"

"Better. The cleaning is progressing. Another few days and I can begin proper repairs."

"And the idea you mentioned—the repair shop?"

Sheldon paused, considering how to explain. "It is becoming more concrete. Ito-san mentioned that people miss having someone in the village who can fix things. Apparently Hideo-san used to do small repairs, before he got too old."

"He did. I remember." Katsuhito's expression was thoughtful. "It was a valuable service. People trusted him."

"She seemed to think there might be demand for something similar."

"There might be. Though you would have to earn that trust yourself."

"I know. That is what concerns me."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "It should concern you. Trust is not given—it is earned. But the fact that you understand that..." He paused. "It speaks well of you."

They stood in silence for a moment, the kitchen quiet around them.

"Get some rest," Katsuhito said finally. "Tomorrow we meet Tanaka. He will assess the roof. And then you will have a clearer picture of what lies ahead."

---

That night, in his room, Sheldon took out the photographs he had brought back from the house.

He had not looked at them since his first visit—had felt, somehow, that he was not ready. But tonight, with the day's work still warm in his muscles and the conversations with the villagers fresh in his mind, he felt the need to understand.

The faces looked back at him from across decades. Hideo as a young man, strong and proud, dressed in work clothes with tools in his belt. His wife—Miyako, according to the documents Sheldon had found—seated beside him in their wedding portrait, her expression serious but her eyes warm. Their son as an infant, wrapped in white cloth, held in his mother's arms.

More photographs, spanning what must have been fifty years. The boy growing up—first steps, first day of school, graduation ceremonies. The parents growing older—gray appearing in hair, lines deepening around eyes. A wedding portrait of the son, and then photographs of grandchildren, and then fewer photographs as the collection approached the present.

The last photograph was Hideo alone, standing in front of the shop, old and tired but still standing. His wife was gone by then—Sheldon could see it in the way he held himself, the particular quality of solitude that came from losing a life's companion.

Nakamura-san had called him a friend. Had said he worried about what would happen to the house.

Sheldon wondered what Hideo had wanted. Had he hoped someone would come to continue the shop, to preserve what he had built? Or had he simply not wanted to see his life's work demolished, carted away, replaced by something modern and characterless?

Either way, the answer was the same. Someone had come. Someone would preserve what could be preserved. Someone would try to be worthy of the legacy.

"I met one of your friends today," Sheldon said quietly, to the photograph of Hideo. "Nakamura-san. He misses you."

The photograph did not respond. But the warmth stirred at the edge of his awareness, acknowledging something—his words, his intention, the choice he was making.

He thought about Tenchi's suggestion: taking photographs of their new family. Capturing this moment in time, this improbable arrangement of people who had somehow become important to each other.

It would not replace what he had lost. Nothing could replace his grandmother, his colleagues, the life he had left behind. But it could be something new. Something that mattered in its own right.

Tomorrow, he would meet Tanaka the roofer. Would begin to understand the scope of the work that lay ahead. Would take another step on the long road from stranger to resident, from outsider to community member.

And eventually—maybe—he would have photographs of his own to place on shelves. Evidence that he had lived here, had belonged here, had been part of something larger than himself.

He set the old photographs aside and prepared for sleep. The room was quiet, the house settling around him with its familiar creaks and sighs. Somewhere outside, an owl called—a sound he was learning to recognize, another piece of this world becoming familiar.

The warmth found him as always, gentle and encompassing, carrying him down into dreams where voices he almost recognized whispered encouragement in languages he almost understood.

His grandmother was there, in those dreams. Not speaking directly—she never did—but present nonetheless. Watching. Approving. Adding her blessing to whatever path he chose to walk.

"I'm trying," he told her, in the way you tell things to people in dreams. "I'm trying to be what you taught me to be."

She smiled, in the dream. And he felt, somehow, that she was proud.

He was alive. He was here. He was making something that mattered.

Day by day. Step by step. One repair at a time.

For now, that was more than enough.

## Day 6

---

## Saturday, April 8, 1989

---

Sheldon woke to the sound of wood striking wood.

The rhythm was steady, precise, coming from somewhere outside the house. Two beats, a pause, two beats, a pause. The pattern of practice, of repetition, of muscles learning movements until they became automatic.

He lay in the futon and listened, trying to identify the source. The sound was muffled by distance and walls, but it carried the particular quality of bamboo—lighter than solid wood, with a resonance that suggested hollow construction.

Bokken, he realized. Wooden practice swords. Katsuhito was training.

He rose and dressed quickly, curiosity pulling him toward the window. The morning light was soft and golden, the sky clear after yesterday's clouds. Through the gap in the shoji screens, he could see part of the courtyard, but the source of the sounds was hidden behind the main hall.

The clock in his mind—still adjusting to this new schedule—suggested it was early, perhaps six-thirty. Katsuhito had been awake for at least an hour, based on the methodical nature of the sounds. This was not warming up; this was serious practice.

Sheldon dressed and went to investigate.

---

He found Katsuhito in a small clearing behind the main hall, an area Sheldon had not yet explored.

The space was simple—just a circle of packed earth surrounded by trees, with a small wooden rack at one edge holding several practice swords. Morning mist still clung to the ground, swirling around Katsuhito's feet as he moved.

The old man stood in a fighting stance, a wooden sword held in both hands, his attention focused on an invisible opponent. He moved through a sequence of strikes with a precision that seemed almost mechanical—until you watched closely and saw the subtle adjustments, the micro-corrections that transformed rote repetition into something alive.

The strikes came in patterns: high, low, diagonal, thrust. Each movement flowed into the next without pause or hesitation, the bokken cutting through the morning air with a sound like whispered breath. Katsuhito's footwork was precise, each step placed exactly where it needed to be, his weight shifting smoothly between attacks.

This was not the movement of an old man exercising to stay healthy. This was the movement of a warrior maintaining skills that had been honed over decades. Every gesture spoke of thousands of hours of practice, of muscles that had learned movements so thoroughly they no longer required conscious thought.

Sheldon found himself analyzing the biomechanics—the way Katsuhito's center of gravity remained constant even during complex maneuvers, the efficiency of motion that wasted nothing, the way his breathing synchronized with his strikes. As a physicist, he could appreciate the elegance of the system. As a human being, he could only marvel at the dedication it represented.

He stood at the edge of the clearing and watched, careful not to interrupt.

The sequence lasted perhaps five minutes. When it ended, Katsuhito lowered his sword and stood in stillness, breathing slowly, his eyes still focused on something Sheldon could not see. Then, without turning:

"You are up early."

"I heard the sounds. I was curious."

"Curiosity is not always wise. Some things are private."

"I apologize. I can leave."

"No." Katsuhito turned, finally, to face him. His expression was neutral, but something in his eyes had shifted—an assessment, perhaps, of how Sheldon would react to what he had seen. "You are part of this household now. You should understand what happens here."

He gestured to a wooden bench at the edge of the clearing. Sheldon sat.

"The sword," Katsuhito said, "is not merely a weapon. It is a path. A way of understanding oneself and the world."

"Kendo?"

"In part. But what I practice is older than kendo, and less... organized." The old man set his bokken on a rack that held several others, each slightly different in length and weight. "The Masaki style has been passed down through our family for generations. It is not taught in dojos. It is not competed in tournaments. It exists only here, and only for those who are worthy of learning."

"Tenchi mentioned that he trains with you."

"He does. He has aptitude—more than he knows. But he is young, and impatient, and does not yet understand what the sword requires." Katsuhito's expression softened slightly. "That understanding will come. It always does, for those who persist."

Sheldon considered asking more, but something told him that this was not the time. Katsuhito had revealed something personal—the depth of his martial skill, the family tradition that he maintained in isolation—and pushing for more would be an intrusion.

"Thank you for showing me," he said instead.

"I did not show you. You observed. There is a difference." But the words were not harsh, and when Katsuhito walked past him toward the house, he added: "Breakfast in thirty minutes. Today we meet Tanaka."

---

Tenchi was already in the kitchen when they returned, standing on his step stool and attempting to reach the container of rice crackers on the top shelf.

"Those are for after breakfast," Katsuhito said, appearing behind him so silently that Tenchi jumped and nearly fell off the stool.

"I was just looking at them!"

"You were looking with your hands."

"Hands can look too. That's called touching."

"Touching is not looking. Touching is touching. And the crackers are for after breakfast."

Tenchi sighed with the dramatic weariness of a child who had tried this argument before and lost. He climbed down from the stool and slumped into his seat at the table.

"What are we doing today?" he asked, directing the question at Sheldon. "Can we go to the house again? Can I help more? I was a very good helper yesterday."

"You were an adequate helper," Katsuhito corrected. "Good helpers do not need to be reminded to stay focused."

"I stayed focused mostly."

"Mostly is not entirely."

Sheldon intervened before the debate could continue. "Today we are meeting a craftsman. Someone who repairs roofs. He is coming to look at the house."

Tenchi's eyes widened. "A real craftsman? Like in stories?"

"A real craftsman. Tanaka-san. He lives in the village."

"Can I watch? Can I ask him questions? Grandpa says I ask too many questions but Mom always said questions are how we learn."

The mention of his mother was casual, almost offhand, but Sheldon caught the slight tightening around Katsuhito's eyes. The old man did not correct or redirect; he simply continued preparing breakfast with his usual efficiency.

"You may watch," Sheldon said. "And you may ask some questions, if they are good questions."

"All my questions are good questions."

"That is debatable."

"That's what Grandpa says too."

---

Breakfast was rice and miso soup and pickled vegetables, the same simple fare that had defined every morning of the past week. But there was something different about this meal—a sense of anticipation, perhaps, or the awareness that the day would bring something new.

They ate in the comfortable silence that had become their custom, punctuated only by Tenchi's occasional observations about the food, the weather, and his plans for the weekend.

"I want to build a fort," he announced, between bites of rice. "A real fort, like in the stories. With walls and a roof and a place to keep my treasures."

"Where would you build this fort?" Katsuhito asked.

"In the forest. Near the big tree. There is a good spot between two rocks where nobody goes."

"Nobody goes there because it is on a slope and difficult to reach."

"That's what makes it a good spot for a fort! Forts should be hard to find."

Sheldon found himself smiling at the logic. There was something pure about a child's reasoning—the way goals were stated simply and obstacles were merely challenges to be overcome.

"Perhaps Tsukino-san can help you with the fort," Katsuhito said. "After the roof assessment. And after morning chores."

Tenchi's face lit up. "Would you? Would you help me build a fort?"

"If there is time. And if we can find appropriate materials."

"There are lots of materials! Sticks and leaves and rocks and... and..." He trailed off, apparently reaching the limits of his construction knowledge.

"We will see what we can find," Sheldon said.

---

After breakfast, Sheldon walked to the village alone.

Katsuhito had tasks at the shrine—preparations for a ceremony later in the week, he had mentioned—and Tenchi had been assigned morning chores that he claimed were "very important and definitely not punishments for trying to get crackers." The arrangement left Sheldon free to meet Tanaka without distractions.

The walk down the three hundred steps was becoming routine. His body had fully adjusted to the daily climbs, his legs no longer protesting the descent or the return. The steps themselves had become familiar—he knew which ones were worn smooth, which had cracks where water pooled, which required extra care when wet.

He had walked this path perhaps a dozen times now. It was starting to feel like his path.

The village was quiet in the early morning, most residents either inside or working in the fields beyond the built-up area. A few people nodded as he passed—recognition without familiarity, the acknowledgment of someone who was becoming known but not yet truly known.

The Tsukino property waited at the end of its small lane, looking the same as it had yesterday: old, weathered, waiting. But today Sheldon approached it differently. Today, it would be assessed by someone who understood traditional construction, who could tell him what needed to be done and what could wait.

Tanaka arrived precisely at nine o'clock, just as Katsuhito had said he would.

---

He was a compact man in his sixties, with the weathered skin and calloused hands of someone who had spent his life working outdoors. His clothes were simple—work pants, a faded shirt, sturdy boots—and he carried a wooden ladder that looked handmade, its rungs worn smooth by years of use.

"Tsukino-san?" His voice was gruff but not unfriendly.

"Yes. Thank you for coming, Tanaka-san."

"Masaki-san asked. I came." He set down the ladder and studied the house with the assessing eye of a professional. His gaze moved systematically across the structure—first the roofline, then the eaves, then down the walls to where they met the foundation. "This is Hideo's place."

"You knew him?"

"Everyone knew him. Good carpenter. Stubborn man. Refused to let anyone help with the roof when he should have." Tanaka shook his head, the motion carrying decades of accumulated frustration. "Told him ten years ago the tiles were shifting. He said he would handle it. He never did."

"Why do you think he refused?"

Tanaka considered the question, his eyes still on the house. "Pride, maybe. Or denial. Old men do not like admitting they can no longer do what they once did easily. The body fails, but the spirit refuses to accept it." He glanced at Sheldon. "You are young. You do not understand this yet."

"Perhaps not. But I am trying to learn."

Something in his tone made Tanaka pause. The roofer studied him for a moment with the same careful assessment he had given the house.

"Masaki-san said you were different," Tanaka said finally. "He did not explain how. I begin to see what he meant."

"How bad is it?"

"That is what we will find out."

Tanaka set his ladder against the front wall and began to climb, his movements careful but confident. He tested each rung before committing his weight, not from uncertainty but from long habit—the caution of a man who knew that a single moment of carelessness could end a career.

Sheldon watched as he reached the eave, pulled himself onto the roof with an ease that belied his age, and began a systematic inspection that covered every visible inch of the surface.

The inspection was methodical, almost ritualistic. Tanaka moved in a grid pattern, testing each tile with his fingers, checking the mortar between them, examining the overlaps where water might seep through. He paid special attention to the valleys where different roof planes met, and to the ridge line at the top.

Twenty minutes passed. Thirty. Tanaka moved across the tiles with the sure-footed grace of someone who had spent a lifetime at heights, occasionally stopping to examine something more closely, sometimes making notes in a small book he carried in his pocket. Once, he lay flat on the tiles to examine something near the eave, staying in that position for several minutes before rising again.

A neighbor walked past the property, paused to observe the inspection, nodded to Sheldon, and continued on. Word would spread, he knew. By evening, the village would know that the American was having the roof assessed. Opinions would be formed, judgments made.

When Tanaka finally descended, his expression was unreadable.

"Well?" Sheldon asked.

"It is not as bad as I feared. But it is not good." Tanaka pulled out his notebook and flipped to the pages he had written. "The tiles on the north side have shifted. Three are cracked and will need to be replaced. The underlayment in one corner has failed—water is getting through. If it is not addressed before the rainy season, you will have rot in the rafters."

"Can it be fixed?"

"Everything can be fixed. The question is whether the fixing is worth the cost." Tanaka studied him for a moment. "This house has good bones. Hideo built it well, and he maintained it well until he got too old to climb. The problems are surface problems, not structural. If you address them now, the house will last another fifty years. If you wait..." He shrugged. "Water finds a way."

"How much?"

Tanaka named a figure. It was substantial, but not ruinous—less than Sheldon had feared, more than he had hoped.

"That includes materials?"

"Materials and labor. I do not cut corners. The work will be done right, or it will not be done at all."

Sheldon extended his hand. "When can you start?"

Tanaka's eyebrows rose slightly—perhaps at the quick decision, or perhaps at the Western gesture. But he shook Sheldon's hand firmly.

"Monday. I have other work today and tomorrow. But Monday morning, I will be here with my crew."

"Thank you, Tanaka-san."

"Do not thank me yet. Wait until the work is done."

---

After Tanaka left, Sheldon walked through the house alone.

The morning light was stronger now, slanting through the dusty windows to reveal details he had missed on previous visits. The grain of the wood in the floors, running in patterns that spoke of careful selection and patient curing. The subtle curves of the plastered walls, shaped by hands that understood how to create surfaces that would last. The proportions of the rooms, designed for the particular rhythms of Japanese life.

Tsukino Hideo had been a craftsman, Tanaka had said. A good carpenter. The evidence was everywhere, if you knew how to look.

Sheldon found himself in the storage room, standing before the box of tools he had discovered with Tenchi. He opened it again, examining each implement with greater attention than before.

The chisels were not merely sharp—they were perfectly balanced, the weight distributed to allow precision without fatigue. The plane's blade was set at an angle he did not immediately recognize, but when he tested it against a scrap of wood, the shaving came off thin and even, almost translucent.

These were not tools for ordinary work. These were tools for excellence.

"I don't know if I'm worthy of you," he said quietly, to the tools. "But I'm going to try."

He closed the box and set it aside for transport to the shrine. These tools deserved better than to sit unused in an empty house. They deserved to be maintained, to be practiced with, to be used for the purpose they had been created.

And perhaps, in using them, he would learn something of the man who had wielded them for so many years.

---

He returned to the shrine to find Tenchi waiting at the top of the steps, vibrating with impatience.

"You took forever!"

"I took exactly as long as I needed to."

"That's what forever means. Can we build the fort now? Grandpa said you would help me when you got back. You're back now."

Sheldon took a moment to catch his breath—the climb was still demanding, even if his body had adapted. "How were your morning chores?"

"Finished. All of them. I swept the main hall and helped Grandpa fold the ceremonial cloths and fed the koi and everything." Tenchi bounced on his heels. "Can we go now?"

Sheldon looked at the sun, gauging the time. Perhaps two hours until lunch. "Show me this spot you have in mind."

Tenchi grabbed his hand and pulled, leading him past the main buildings, past the great tree with its sacred rope, into the forest beyond. The path—if it could be called a path—wound between trees and over roots, climbing gradually toward the slope of the mountain.

The forest was different here than at the lower elevations. The trees were older, their trunks thicker, their canopies forming a cathedral-like ceiling overhead. Ferns grew in the shadows, and moss covered everything that held still long enough to host it. The air was cooler, damper, with a green smell that spoke of growth and decay in equal measure.

Tenchi moved through this environment with the confidence of someone who had explored it countless times. He knew where the stable ground was, where the treacherous patches lay, where you could step safely and where you needed to find another route.

"I come here a lot," he said, noticing Sheldon's observation. "When Grandpa is busy and I want to be by myself. Well, by myself with Usagi-chan. She likes it here too."

"The stuffed rabbit accompanies you on forest expeditions?"

"She likes adventures. She says she used to have lots of adventures before she came to live with me."

"Did she tell you about them?"

"Some of them. But she says the best adventures are secrets."

The spot Tenchi had chosen was, as promised, difficult to reach. Two large boulders formed a natural corner, their surfaces weathered by centuries of rain and wind, covered with patches of lichen in green and orange. The ground between them was relatively flat, a natural shelf where soil had accumulated over the years. The trees overhead offered protection from rain while still allowing dappled light through.

"See?" Tenchi said proudly. "It's perfect."

Sheldon surveyed the area with a carpenter's eye—or at least, with the beginnings of one. The ground was stable, the soil compacted by time. The boulders would provide natural walls on two sides, eliminating half the construction challenge. The slight overhang of one boulder offered additional weather protection.

"It is a good location," he admitted. "Better than I expected."

Tenchi beamed. "I found it last summer. I was looking for beetles and I got lost and then I found this and I wasn't lost anymore because now I knew where something was."

"That is an interesting way to think about being lost."

"Grandpa says you're only lost if you don't know where anything is. But if you know where one thing is, you can find everything else from there."

"Your grandfather is—"

"Wise. I know." Tenchi grinned. "You always say that."

They spent the next two hours gathering materials and beginning construction.

Sheldon showed Tenchi how to select fallen branches that were sturdy but not rotten—pressing his thumbnail into the wood to test its firmness, checking for signs of insect damage, avoiding anything that felt soft or punky. They collected armfuls of suitable pieces, carrying them back to the building site and sorting them by size.

"The framework needs to be strong," Sheldon explained, demonstrating how to lay the first pieces. "These larger branches will carry the weight of everything else. If they fail, the whole structure fails."

"Like bones?"

"Exactly like bones. The skeleton holds everything up."

Tenchi nodded seriously, absorbing the lesson with the intensity he brought to anything he deemed important. He helped position the main supports, holding them steady while Sheldon lashed them together with strips of bark and flexible vines.

The basic framework took shape slowly. Two main poles leaned against the larger boulder, meeting at a point near the top. Crosspieces connected them, creating a triangular frame that would eventually support a covering of leaves and brush. It was not complex architecture—just a simple lean-to structure—but the principles were the same as any building.

"Why do we tie them like that?" Tenchi asked, watching Sheldon bind two poles together.

"The wrapping distributes the pressure. If you just stack the poles, they will slide apart. But if you wrap them, the friction of the binding holds them together."

"Like holding hands?"

"In a way, yes. The poles are holding hands so they do not fall down."

Tenchi considered this, then nodded with satisfaction. "I like that. Poles that hold hands."

By the time they finished the main framework, both of them were dirty and tired and thoroughly pleased with their progress. The structure did not look like much yet—just a skeleton of interlocking branches propped against rock—but the shape was there, the potential visible to anyone who knew how to see it.

"This is going to be the best fort ever," Tenchi declared.

"It will be a fort. Whether it is the best ever remains to be seen."

"It will be. Because we built it together." He said this with the simple certainty of a child who had not yet learned to doubt.

Sheldon handed him a rice ball and watched him eat.

"Tanaka-san came to look at the roof this morning," he said. "He is going to fix it next week."

"Does that mean the house will be ready soon?"

"It means the house will be one step closer. There is still a lot of work to do."

"But eventually you'll live there? In the village?"

"Eventually, yes. When it's ready."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, processing this. "Will you still come to the shrine?"

"Of course. The village is not far. I can walk up the steps every day if I need to."

"Promise?"

"Tenchi..." Sheldon set down his rice ball and met the boy's eyes. "I am not going to disappear. Even when I move to the village, I will still be nearby. I will still visit. I will still help with the shrine. The only thing that will change is where I sleep."

"That's what grown-ups always say. 'Things will be the same.' But things are never the same. Things always change."

"You're right. Things do change. But some things—the important things—can stay constant even when the surface changes. My caring about you, about your grandfather, about this place... that will not change just because I sleep in a different house."

Tenchi considered this, his small face serious. Then he nodded slowly.

"Okay. But you have to keep promising. Every time I ask."

"That seems excessive."

"Mom used to say that important things deserve to be said more than once."

"Your mother was wise."

"Everyone says that. But I already knew it."

---

The afternoon was spent on shrine tasks.

Katsuhito had a list, as always—written in his precise hand on a sheet of paper that he handed to Sheldon without comment. The gutters on the main hall needed cleaning—leaves and debris had accumulated despite Sheldon's earlier efforts. The stone lanterns needed their lamps refilled with oil. A section of fence behind the guest quarters had developed a lean that needed correcting. The moss on the north-facing stones had grown too thick and should be scraped back.

Sheldon worked methodically through each task, his mind drifting as his hands handled the familiar labor.

The gutters were the most tedious work—climbing a ladder, reaching into narrow channels, pulling out handfuls of decomposed leaves and the occasional dead insect. The debris had compressed into a dark, moist mass that smelled of earth and decay. But clearing it was essential; clogged gutters meant water running down walls, seeping into foundations, causing damage that would be expensive to repair.

He thought about the roof assessment as he worked, about Tanaka's professional competence and the respect the roofer had shown for Hideo's craftsmanship. There was a culture here, he was learning, a web of relationships between craftsmen and clients that stretched across generations. Tanaka had known Hideo. Katsuhito knew Tanaka. The connections were not just economic but personal—trust built over years of reliable work and fair dealing.

He thought about his grandmother, who had believed that work was a form of meditation. "When your hands are busy," she had told him, "your mind is free. Let it wander. Let it find what it needs."

His mind found memories. The lab in Alaska, the blue light of the experiment, the moment before everything changed. The field in Japan, the warmth in his chest, the disorientation of waking in a body that was not quite his own.

And then the shrine. The steps. The old man and the small boy who had, improbably, become his people.

The stone lanterns were easier work—simply a matter of opening each one, checking the oil level, refilling from a can he found in the storage shed. But there was a meditative quality to the task, a rhythm of open, check, fill, close that left space for thought.

Seven lanterns lined the main approach to the shrine. Each was slightly different—different sizes, different ages, different styles of carving. The oldest, near the torii gate, bore inscriptions so worn by weather that they were nearly illegible. Sheldon traced them with his fingers, wondering what they had said, who had carved them, what prayers they had once announced.

The fence repair required more attention—diagnosing the cause of the lean (a post had rotted at the base), selecting a replacement from the pile of lumber behind the storage building, cutting it to length, digging out the old post, setting the new one in concrete mixed from a bag he found on a shelf.

Tenchi appeared halfway through this process, having apparently completed whatever afternoon activities he had found for himself.

"Can I help?"

"You can hold the post straight while I pack the concrete around it."

The boy took his position seriously, gripping the post with both hands and maintaining its vertical alignment through sheer determination. When Sheldon checked it with a level, it was nearly perfect.

"Good," he said. "You have steady hands."

"That's what Grandpa says. He says it's important for the sword."

"It is important for many things."

They worked together until the concrete was set, then cleaned the tools and put everything away properly. The simple act of sharing a task had a bonding quality that Sheldon was learning to appreciate—the way joint labor created connection without requiring words.

Was this what the warmth had intended? This quiet life, this slow building, this accumulation of connections and responsibilities? It seemed so modest compared to the cosmic strangeness of his arrival. A dead man, resurrected and transported through time, reduced to cleaning gutters and building forts and mixing concrete.

But perhaps that was the point.

Perhaps the grand gestures—the scientific breakthroughs, the theoretical advances, the work that was supposed to change the world—had never been the measure of a life well lived. Perhaps the measure was smaller and simpler: the people you helped, the things you fixed, the moments of connection that accumulated into something meaningful.

His grandmother had lived that way. Had never sought fame or recognition, had never published papers or won awards. Had simply tended her garden and maintained her house and loved the people who came into her life. And she had been, by any measure that mattered, a success.

Could he learn to live that way? Could he let go of the ambition that had driven him in his first life, the need to be important, to matter, to leave a mark on the world?

He was not sure. But he was starting to think he wanted to try.

Dinner was simple: rice, grilled fish, miso soup, pickled vegetables. The same elements as every other meal, recombined in slightly different proportions, creating continuity without monotony.

Sheldon helped with the preparation tonight—washing rice, chopping vegetables, learning the particular rhythm of Katsuhito's kitchen. The old man moved through the space with the efficiency of someone who had cooked in this room for decades, reaching for implements without looking, adjusting heat by instinct rather than measurement.

"You watch carefully," Katsuhito observed, as Sheldon noted the exact timing of when he added ingredients to the soup.

"I am trying to learn."

"Learning to cook, or learning something else?"

"Both, perhaps. The way someone cooks tells you something about who they are."

Katsuhito made a small sound that might have been approval. "And what does my cooking tell you?"

"That you value efficiency without sacrificing quality. That you understand the importance of preparation. That you have done this long enough that the mechanics are automatic, leaving your mind free for other things."

"And what things occupy my mind while I cook?"

Sheldon considered. "I do not know. But I suspect they are the same things that occupy your mind at other times. Your grandson. The shrine. The responsibilities you carry."

Katsuhito was silent for a moment, stirring the soup with slow, deliberate motions.

"You see more than most," he said finally. "That is useful. But it can also be dangerous."

"Dangerous how?"

"People do not always wish to be seen clearly. They prefer their surfaces, their presentations. The person who sees beneath..." He shook his head. "It creates complications."

"I will try to be tactful."

"See that you do."

Tenchi dominated the dinner conversation, as he often did. He described the fort in elaborate detail—its current state, its planned expansions, the improvements he wanted to make. He outlined the treasures he intended to keep there (a growing list that included the coin from the Tsukino house, several interesting rocks, the feather he claimed was from a magical bird, and now a smooth piece of bark that he had found during their building session).

"The bark is shaped like a boat," he explained, holding it up for inspection. "If I put it in water, it will float. I tested it."

"When did you test it?"

"In the bath last night. Grandpa did not know." He glanced at his grandfather. "Until now."

"I knew," Katsuhito said mildly. "I also know about the rocks you put in your pockets and the beetle you tried to hide in the storage building."

Tenchi's face fell. "How did you know about the beetle?"

"I know everything that happens in this shrine. It is my responsibility to know."

"That seems like a lot of knowing."

"It is. That is why I need helpers." Katsuhito's gaze shifted to Sheldon, and something passed between them—an acknowledgment, perhaps, of the role Sheldon was increasingly playing in this household.

After dinner, while Tenchi was sent to prepare for bed, Sheldon helped clean up. The rhythm of washing and drying was becoming familiar now, another routine in the pattern of days.

"The roof assessment went well?" Katsuhito asked, though he had already heard the summary at dinner.

"Yes. Tanaka is a careful man. He took his time."

"He learned from his father, who learned from his grandfather. Three generations of roofers in that family. They have maintained half the houses in this village."

"He mentioned that Hideo was stubborn about accepting help."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "Hideo was proud. Too proud, some would say. He came from a time when a man was expected to handle his own affairs without assistance." He set down the dish he was drying. "That kind of pride has its place. But it can also become a prison."

"Did you know him well?"

"Well enough. We were not friends, exactly—our worlds did not overlap much. But we respected each other. He maintained the shrine's outbuildings for many years, when I was younger and had less time for such things."

"I found his tools. In the house."

"Ah." Something shifted in Katsuhito's expression—recognition, perhaps, or memory. "He was very particular about his tools. Would not let anyone else touch them."

"They are remarkable. The craftsmanship is exceptional."

"His father was a toolmaker. Before the war, before everything changed. He made those tools for Hideo when Hideo was young—a gift, to start his career. They are the only things Hideo had left of his father, afterward."

The weight of that statement settled over the kitchen. Tools that carried memory, that connected a man to a past that had been otherwise destroyed. Sheldon understood, suddenly, why Hideo had been so particular about them.

"I will take care of them," he said quietly. "I will try to be worthy of them."

"That is all any of us can do. Try to be worthy of what we are given."

They finished the dishes in silence, the weight of the conversation filling the space between them. When everything was put away, Katsuhito turned to face him.

"The boy likes you."

"I like him too."

"That is obvious. What is less obvious is why." Katsuhito's gaze was direct, assessing. "You are not obligated to him. You could treat him with polite distance, as a guest might. Instead, you build forts. You answer his endless questions. You carry him when he is tired."

"He is a good child. He deserves attention."

"Many children deserve attention and do not receive it. What makes you willing to give it?"

Sheldon thought about the question—really thought, not just reaching for an easy answer. "I had a grandmother who gave me that kind of attention. Who made me feel seen, valued, important. I did not appreciate it at the time. But I understand now what a gift it was."

"And you wish to pass that gift along."

"If I can. If I am able."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "That is a good reason. Perhaps the best reason."

"There is another reason too," Sheldon admitted. "He reminds me of myself, at that age. Curious about everything. Full of questions. Not quite fitting into the world around him."

"You do not fit in?"

"I never have. In my previous—" He caught himself. "In my earlier life, I was always slightly apart. Observing more than participating. Understanding ideas more easily than people."

"And now?"

"Now I am trying to learn. To connect. To be part of something instead of just watching it from outside."

Katsuhito was quiet for a long moment.

"That is a hard thing to learn," he said finally. "But it can be learned. I have seen people do it."

"Have you?"

"Yes." A pause. "I was one of them."

It was the most personal thing Katsuhito had revealed—a window into a past that Sheldon was only beginning to glimpse. The old man did not elaborate, and Sheldon did not push. Some revelations needed time to unfold.

---

That evening, after Tenchi had been sent to bed and the house had settled into quiet, Sheldon sat on the engawa and looked at the stars.

The sky was clear, the Milky Way a faint band of light stretching across the darkness. He could see constellations he recognized—Orion rising in the east, the Big Dipper wheeling around the North Star—and others he was still learning to identify. The Japanese names for the stars were different from the ones he had grown up with, and he was slowly adding them to his vocabulary.

The great tree was a dark mass against the star-field, its branches reaching toward the sky like outstretched arms. In the darkness, it seemed even larger than it did in daylight—a presence that commanded attention, that demanded acknowledgment.

He wondered, not for the first time, what the tree really was. A sacred object, clearly—the rope and offerings marked it as spiritually significant. But Katsuhito's reverence suggested something more, something beyond ordinary religious observance. And the warmth that stirred in Sheldon's chest when he stood near it... that was not imagination.

There were mysteries here. Layers beneath layers, truths that were not yet ready to be revealed. He was learning patience—learning to wait for understanding to come in its own time rather than forcing it.

The warmth stirred at the edge of his awareness, present but quiet. It had been like this since his arrival—a constant presence that offered no guidance, no instructions, no explanation. Just... companionship, perhaps. The sense that he was not entirely alone.

He had stopped trying to communicate with it directly. Whatever the warmth was, it operated on its own schedule, revealing what it wanted to reveal when it was ready. Pushing for more only led to frustration.

Instead, he simply acknowledged it. Included it in his awareness the way he might include the sound of crickets or the smell of cedar. Another element of this life that he was learning to accept.

"One week," he said quietly, to the stars or the warmth or simply to himself. "One week in this world."

It seemed impossible. The days had been so full, so dense with new experiences and new relationships, that they felt like months. And yet they had also passed quickly, each one flowing into the next without clear boundaries.

He thought about the people he had met in that week. Katsuhito, with his layers of mystery and dry wisdom. Tenchi, with his endless questions and boundless energy. Ito-san at the grocery store. Nakamura-san, who remembered Hideo. Tanaka the roofer. The women at the bus stop. The shopkeepers in Kurashiki.

A web of connections, still thin but growing stronger. Each interaction a thread, each conversation a strand woven into something larger.

In his old life, he had been isolated. Had preferred it that way, or so he had told himself. Research required focus, concentration, freedom from distraction. Social connections were time-consuming, emotionally draining, ultimately less important than the work.

But the work was gone now. The lab, the experiments, the theoretical frameworks—all of it lost to time and circumstance. What remained was this: a body, a place, and the opportunity to build something new.

Was he building well? He did not know. Could not know, really, until years had passed and the results became visible. But he was trying. That had to count for something.

Tomorrow would be Sunday. Another day without school for Tenchi, another day of shrine work and house restoration and the slow accumulation of a life.

He thought about what Sunday might bring. More work on the fort, perhaps. Preparations for the week ahead. Maybe a walk to the village to check on the house before Tanaka's crew arrived Monday.

Small things. Daily things. The fabric of an ordinary life, woven one thread at a time.

Monday, Tanaka would come to fix the roof. A concrete step toward making the Tsukino house habitable again. After that, the tatami. Then the plumbing, the electrical, the hundred small repairs that would transform a neglected building into a home.

And eventually, the repair shop. The place where he would put his skills to use, where he would become known as the person who fixed things. The role that would anchor him to this community, that would give him purpose and connection.

It was a modest dream compared to what he had once imagined for himself. No scientific breakthroughs, no papers in prestigious journals, no name remembered by future generations. Just a man in a small village, doing useful work for people who needed it.

But perhaps that was enough. Perhaps it was more than enough.

His grandmother had lived that way. Had found contentment in the simple rhythms of daily life, in the satisfaction of work well done, in the love of people who knew and valued her. She had never sought fame or recognition, and she had died surrounded by people who loved her, mourned by a community that remembered her kindness.

What more could anyone ask for?

The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and ancient. The crickets sang their endless song. The warmth hummed quietly at the edge of his awareness, patient and constant.

Sheldon sat on the engawa until the night grew cold, watching the constellations shift across the sky. He thought about time—the vastness of cosmic time, the brevity of human time, the strange loops and folds of the time he himself had experienced. Thirty-six years from death to birth. A life ended and begun in the same moment, separated by decades.

He did not understand it. Might never understand it. But he was learning to accept it—the mystery, the uncertainty, the not-knowing that was the condition of existence.

Eventually, the cold drove him inside. He prepared for sleep with the methodical care that had become habit: laying out the futon, arranging the covers, setting aside tomorrow's clothes.

Tomorrow would come soon enough. Tonight, he rested.

The warmth found him as always, gentle and encompassing, wrapping around him like a blanket made of starlight. It carried him down into dreams where voices he almost recognized whispered encouragement in languages he almost understood.

His grandmother was there, as she often was in dreams. Not speaking directly, not offering guidance, just present. Watching. Approving.

In the dream, he showed her the shrine. The great tree with its sacred rope. The stone lanterns lining the approach. The boy who reminded him of himself at that age.

She smiled, in the way she had always smiled when he showed her something he was proud of. And though she did not speak, he understood what she would have said:

*You are building something good. Keep building.*

He woke briefly in the middle of the night, the dream still vivid, the message still resonating. Through the window, he could see the stars, still wheeling their slow dance across the sky.

He was alive. He was here. He was making something that mattered.

Day by day. Step by step. One repair at a time.

For now, that was more than enough.

⁂

## Day 7

---

## Sunday, April 9, 1989

---

Sheldon woke before dawn.

This had not been his habit in his previous life—he had been a night owl by preference, staying up late with equations and simulations, sleeping until the last possible moment before dragging himself to the lab. But something about this body, or this place, or perhaps simply the rhythms of rural life, had shifted his internal clock. Now he rose with the light, eager to meet the day.

He lay in the futon for a few minutes, listening to the sounds of the house settling around him. The creak of old wood adjusting to temperature changes. The distant call of birds beginning their morning chorus. The soft whisper of wind through the trees outside his window.

Sunday. The seventh day. A full week since he had woken in that field, confused and disoriented and very much alive when he should have been dead.

It felt like longer. It felt like he had been here forever, and also like he had just arrived. Time was strange that way—stretching and compressing depending on how much happened within it.

He rose, folded his futon, and went to greet the day.

---

The shrine was quiet in the pre-dawn light.

Sheldon walked the main courtyard alone, his footsteps soft on the stone paths. The great tree loomed against the lightening sky, its branches reaching upward like supplicant arms. The stone lanterns he had filled yesterday stood sentinel along the approach, their lamps dark now but ready for evening.

Everything was still. Everything was waiting.

He found himself drawn, as he often was, toward the great tree. Its presence was magnetic—a gravity that pulled at something deep inside him, something the warmth in his chest recognized and responded to.

He stopped at the rope that marked the tree's sacred boundary. Shimenawa, Katsuhito had called it, though he had not explained what it meant or why the tree required such demarcation. The rope was thick and heavy, woven from rice straw, with paper streamers hanging from it at intervals.

The tree was old. Older than the shrine, older than the village, older perhaps than anything else on this mountain. Its trunk was massive—it would take several people with arms outstretched to circle it—and its bark was deeply furrowed, creating patterns that almost looked like writing.

Sheldon stood before it and breathed.

The warmth stirred in his chest, responding to the tree's presence. Not communicating exactly, but... acknowledging. Two things recognizing each other across whatever distance separated them.

"What are you?" Sheldon whispered.

The tree did not answer. But he had not expected it to. Some questions required patience—years of patience, perhaps. He was learning to wait.

He bowed, as he had seen Katsuhito do, and turned back toward the house.

---

Breakfast was different today.

Instead of the usual simple fare, Katsuhito had prepared something more elaborate: rice porridge with pickled plum, grilled fish, tamagoyaki with extra care given to the rolling, a small dish of seasonal vegetables arranged with an artist's eye.

"Today is special?" Sheldon asked, settling onto his cushion.

"Today is Sunday," Katsuhito said, as though that explained everything. "And today we have a ceremony. The shrine has obligations."

Tenchi was already at the table, still in his pajamas, his hair defying several laws of physics. He looked up from his rice porridge with bright eyes.

"Ceremony means visitors! People come from the village!"

"Some people," Katsuhito corrected. "Not many. A small ceremony for the beginning of the planting season."

"What kind of ceremony?" Sheldon asked.

"We ask the kami for favorable weather and good harvests. It is tradition—done every spring, every autumn, at the turning of the seasons." Katsuhito's expression was neutral, but something in his voice suggested depths beneath the simple explanation. "The village depends on the rice crop. The rice crop depends on the weather. The weather depends on..." He paused. "Many things."

"On the kami?"

"On whatever forces govern the world. We give them names, build them shrines, offer them respect. Whether they listen..." A small shrug. "That is beyond our knowledge."

It was a surprisingly agnostic statement from a Shinto priest. Sheldon filed it away for future contemplation.

"Can I help with the ceremony?" he asked.

"You may observe. Participation requires training that you do not have." Katsuhito's tone was not unkind. "But your presence would be... appropriate. You are part of this household now. The village should see you."

"Then I will observe."

---

After breakfast, the preparations began.

Katsuhito moved through the shrine with purpose, checking details that Sheldon had not known were details. The arrangement of offerings on the main altar—rice, sake, salt, water, vegetables. The positioning of ceremonial implements whose names Sheldon did not know. The hanging of fresh shimenawa on smaller shrines scattered throughout the grounds.

"Can I help?" Sheldon asked again, feeling useless.

"You can help by staying out of the way," Katsuhito said, not unkindly. "Tenchi, show him the preparation shed. He can observe the instruments."

Tenchi grabbed Sheldon's hand and led him to a small building behind the main hall—the same direction as the sword training clearing, but not as far into the forest. The shed was simple: one room, roughly the size of a large closet in a Western home, with shelves lining the walls and everything covered in cloth to protect it from dust.

The building itself was old—older than the main hall, perhaps, judging by the style of its construction and the weathering of its wood. But it was well-maintained, the roof sound, the walls solid, the door opening smoothly on oiled hinges.

"Grandpa keeps the special things here," Tenchi explained, with the importance of a child sharing secrets. "The things for ceremonies. I'm not supposed to touch them."

"Then we will not touch them. We will only look."

The shelves held an array of objects: wooden wands with paper streamers attached—harai-gushi, Sheldon's mind supplied, though he did not know where the knowledge came from. Ceramic vessels of various sizes, their glazes showing the particular colors and textures of traditional Japanese pottery. A set of drums arranged from small to large, their drum heads tight and waiting to be struck.

There was a bow and arrows unlike any hunting equipment Sheldon had seen—the bow asymmetrical, longer above the grip than below, with a distinctive curve that suggested ceremonial rather than practical use. The arrows were fletched with feathers that looked ancient, their colors faded but their construction still sound.

Numerous other items lined the shelves: bells on wooden handles, ceremonial mirrors in lacquered frames, folded silk robes in colors that ranged from pure white to deep purple. Some objects Sheldon could not identify at all—their purposes lost to him, their significance hidden behind centuries of tradition.

"What is that?" He pointed to a large wooden structure that looked like a miniature house, standing perhaps two feet tall on its own platform.

"That's the mikoshi. The portable shrine. They carry it in festivals." Tenchi's voice dropped to a whisper, as though the shrine itself might be listening. "There's a special thing inside. A very special thing. Grandpa says it's been in our family for... for..." He screwed up his face, trying to remember. "For longer than anyone can count."

"Do you know what it is?"

"No. Grandpa won't tell me. He says I'll understand when I'm older." The familiar complaint of children everywhere, delivered with the particular frustration of someone who had heard this response too many times. "But I think it's something important. Something... special."

The warmth in Sheldon's chest stirred slightly, as though responding to something in this room. He looked around more carefully, trying to identify the source of the response. Was it the mikoshi? The mirrors? Something else entirely?

He could not tell. The warmth was not specific in its attention—just generally more alert, more present than it had been moments before.

"Can you feel it?" Tenchi whispered.

Sheldon looked at the boy in surprise. "Feel what?"

"The... the something. In here. It's different from outside. Like the air is heavier."

"I... yes. I can feel it."

Tenchi nodded solemnly, as though this confirmed something he had suspected. "Grandpa says some people can feel it and some people can't. Mom could feel it. She said it was like standing near a fire—warm even when you weren't looking at it."

"Your mother was perceptive."

"What does that mean?"

"It means she noticed things. Things that other people missed."

"Oh." Tenchi looked around the shed one more time. "Come on. We should go back. Grandpa will want us ready."

---

The villagers began arriving around mid-morning.

They came in small groups—two or three at a time, walking up the three hundred steps with the measured pace of people who had made this climb many times before. Older couples mostly, dressed in clean but simple clothes, their expressions carrying the particular solemnity of religious observance.

Sheldon stood to the side of the main courtyard, Tenchi beside him, watching as Katsuhito greeted each arrival with formal bows and careful words. The old man had transformed: gone was the dry-witted grandfather, replaced by a figure of genuine authority, his bearing straight, his movements precise, his voice carrying the weight of centuries of tradition.

"He looks different," Tenchi whispered.

"He is being the priest," Sheldon whispered back. "It is a different role than being your grandfather."

"But he's still Grandpa inside, right?"

"Yes. He is still himself. He is just showing a different part of himself."

This seemed to satisfy Tenchi, though his eyes stayed fixed on his grandfather with something like awe.

About twenty people gathered in total—farmers and shopkeepers, elderly couples and a few middle-aged residents. Sheldon recognized some of them: Ito-san from the grocery store, Nakamura-san who had known Hideo, the women from the bus stop. Others were new faces, though several glanced at him with the curiosity of people who had heard about the American stranger.

The ceremony began with a purification ritual.

Katsuhito moved through the gathered crowd with a wand—one of the wooden implements Sheldon had seen in the preparation shed—waving it over each person in turn while speaking words too quiet to hear clearly. The paper streamers caught the light as they moved, creating patterns that were almost hypnotic.

Sheldon watched the faces of the villagers as the purification passed over them. Some had their eyes closed, their expressions inward, focused on whatever prayers or hopes they held. Others watched Katsuhito with a kind of reverent attention, following his movements with the familiarity of people who had seen this ritual many times but still found meaning in it.

A woman near the front was crying, silent tears running down weathered cheeks. Sheldon wondered what she was asking for—what weight she carried that the ceremony helped her lay down, even temporarily.

Then came the offerings. Each element was presented to the altar with precise gestures, accompanied by prayers that Katsuhito chanted in a style of Japanese that sounded older, more formal than modern speech. The rhythms were almost musical, rising and falling in patterns that felt ancient, connected to something deeper than mere words.

The rice was offered first—a small bowl of uncooked grains, white and perfect, representing the crop they hoped to grow. Then sake, poured into a ceramic vessel with careful attention to the amount. Then salt, in a small pile on a wooden tray. Then water, drawn that morning from the well beside the main hall.

Vegetables came next—the first of the spring harvest, small and slightly misshapen but obviously cherished. Each offering was accompanied by prayers, by bows, by the particular gestures that Sheldon was learning to recognize as part of Shinto ritual.

The gathered villagers bowed their heads, their lips moving in silent response. Some held their hands in prayer position. Others simply stood with heads bowed, their bodies still, their attention focused on the altar and the priest who interceded on their behalf.

Sheldon watched, trying to understand not just the actions but the meaning behind them. This was not merely ritual for ritual's sake—he could see that in the faces of the participants. These were people asking for something they genuinely needed. Rain at the right times, sun at the right times, the delicate balance that determined whether crops would flourish or fail.

In an agricultural community, a bad harvest was not an inconvenience—it was a catastrophe. People would go hungry, children would suffer, the elderly might not survive the winter. The stakes were real and immediate, not abstract. When these farmers prayed for good weather, they were praying for survival.

In his previous life, he would have analyzed this anthropologically. Would have seen it as a psychological mechanism for managing uncertainty, a way for communities to feel agency over forces beyond their control. And perhaps it was that. But standing here, watching, he felt something more.

The warmth in his chest responded to the ceremony. Not strongly—not the way it responded to the great tree—but perceptibly. As though it recognized what was happening, acknowledged the reaching out, the asking.

Could prayers actually work? Could words and offerings and collective intention actually influence the world?

He did not know. Could not know, with the limited understanding he had. But he was less certain of his skepticism than he had been a week ago. He had died and been resurrected. He had traveled thirty-six years through time. He had a warmth in his chest that seemed to understand things he did not.

Perhaps the universe was larger and stranger than any scientific model could capture. Perhaps the old ways held truths that modernity had forgotten how to see.

---

The ceremony lasted perhaps an hour.

When it ended, Katsuhito invited the participants to stay for tea and small refreshments—mochi and rice crackers that had been prepared the night before. The formal atmosphere loosened, became social, conversations breaking out among people who had known each other for years.

The transformation was remarkable. Moments before, they had been supplicants before the divine, their faces solemn, their attention focused on matters of life and death. Now they were neighbors catching up on gossip, sharing news, commenting on the weather and the state of each other's fields.

Sheldon found himself reminded of church potlucks in his grandmother's community—the way religious gatherings served social functions beyond their spiritual purpose. The ceremony brought people together, but the tea afterward built relationships.

Several villagers approached Sheldon, their curiosity no longer restrained by ceremonial solemnity.

"You are the one from Alaska?" An elderly man, stooped with age but sharp-eyed. He had been standing near the front during the ceremony, his lips moving in silent prayer.

"A physicist, yes. I am taking time away from research to travel."

"And you inherited Hideo's house?"

"It came to me through family connections. Distant family."

The man nodded slowly, as though processing this. "Hideo was a good man. Stubborn, but good. The village was poorer when he stopped working."

"I hope to continue something of what he did. A repair shop, perhaps."

"That would be useful." The words were simple, but the approval behind them was clear. "We need someone who can fix things. Everything breaks, eventually."

"Yes. Everything does."

They stood in companionable silence for a moment, watching the gathering. The old man's name was Taniguchi, Sheldon learned—a retired farmer whose children had moved to the city but who refused to leave the village where he had spent his entire life.

"The land holds us," Taniguchi said, when Sheldon asked why he stayed. "Even when it would be easier to leave. Even when the body fails and the work becomes too hard. The land holds us."

It was a perspective Sheldon had not considered. His life had been mobile, flexible—moving from school to school, lab to lab, wherever the work took him. The idea of being bound to a place, of belonging so thoroughly that leaving became unthinkable, was foreign to him.

But perhaps it was something he could learn.

Taniguchi moved on, replaced by a woman Sheldon recognized as one of the bus stop mothers—Yamada-san, who had been curious about his Japanese.

"Your Japanese is very good," she said. "For an American."

"Thank you. I had a good teacher."

"Who taught you?"

The question required a careful answer. "I spent time with Japanese colleagues during my research. They helped me learn."

"Ah." She seemed to accept this. "My son is studying English in school. Perhaps... when he is older... you could help him practice?"

"I would be happy to."

"English will be important for his future. The world is changing. Jobs require international skills." Her expression was a mix of pride and worry—the universal look of parents trying to prepare their children for a future they cannot predict.

"The world is always changing," Sheldon agreed. "But some things remain constant. Hard work, kindness, integrity—these matter in any language."

Yamada-san smiled at this, her expression warming. "You sound like Masaki-san. He says similar things."

"I will take that as a compliment."

The conversation continued—small talk, really, the kind of exchange that built familiarity without requiring depth. But Sheldon understood its importance. Each conversation was a thread, a connection, another strand in the web that would eventually make him part of this community.

---

By early afternoon, the visitors had departed.

Katsuhito changed out of his ceremonial robes and back into ordinary clothes, the transformation in reverse. The priest became the grandfather again, though something of that formal bearing remained.

"That went well," Sheldon observed.

"It went as it always does. The ceremony has not changed in generations." Katsuhito began gathering the remnants of the refreshments. "Did you learn anything?"

"I learned that the village respects you. That they take the ceremony seriously. That they are curious about me but willing to withhold judgment."

"All correct observations. What else?"

Sheldon hesitated. "I felt something. During the ceremony. The warmth that I—" He paused, unsure how much to reveal.

Katsuhito's expression did not change, but his attention sharpened. "Go on."

"The warmth in my chest responded. Not strongly, but... it recognized what was happening. As though it understood the ceremony in a way I did not."

The old man was silent for a long moment.

"There are many things in this world that defy easy explanation," he said finally. "Things that science cannot measure, that logic cannot contain. I have learned to accept them without fully understanding them." He met Sheldon's eyes. "You would do well to learn the same."

"I am trying."

"Yes. I can see that." Katsuhito turned back to his cleaning. "Lunch in an hour. After that, you and Tenchi may continue your construction project."

The dismissal was clear, but not unkind. Sheldon withdrew, his mind full of questions that had no answers.

---

Lunch was simple: leftover rice, pickled vegetables, miso soup made from the dregs of the morning's batch. The elaborate breakfast seemed to have exhausted Katsuhito's culinary ambitions for the day.

Tenchi ate quickly, his attention already on the afternoon's activities. "Can we work on the fort now? Please? The frame is almost done and we need to add the roof and then we need to—"

"After lunch," Katsuhito said. "And after you help clean up."

"I always help clean up."

"Then this should be easy."

The familiar exchange, repeated with minor variations every day. Sheldon found it comforting—the predictability of it, the way routines created structure even when everything else was uncertain.

They cleaned up together, the three of them moving through the kitchen with the coordination of people who had learned each other's rhythms. Katsuhito washed, Sheldon dried, Tenchi put things away (with occasional corrections from his grandfather about proper placement).

"The ceremony—" Sheldon began.

"Yes?"

"The prayers. The offerings. Do you believe they work?"

Katsuhito did not answer immediately. He finished washing the last bowl, handed it to Sheldon, dried his hands on a cloth.

"I believe," he said carefully, "that intention matters. That when people focus their hopes on something together, it creates a kind of energy. Whether that energy influences the weather, or the crops, or anything else..." He shrugged. "I do not know. But I know that the village needs the ceremony. They need to feel that they have done something, asked for something, participated in their own fate."

"So it is psychological?"

"Perhaps. Or perhaps the kami are real and they appreciate being asked." A flicker of amusement crossed his face. "I have been doing this for a very long time. I have seen years of good harvests and years of bad ones. They do not seem to correlate with the quality of our ceremonies. But the people who participate... they seem better able to face whatever comes. That, at least, is real."

It was a more nuanced answer than Sheldon had expected. And it echoed something his grandmother had once said, about church: "I don't know if God listens. But I know that asking helps me figure out what I really want."

"Thank you for explaining," he said.

"Thank you for asking." Katsuhito hung up the cloth. "Now go build your fort. Tenchi has been patient long enough."

---

They returned to the construction site in the early afternoon.

The frame stood as they had left it—a skeleton of branches leaning against the boulders, waiting for completion. Tenchi circled it with proprietary pride, checking each joint, testing the stability of the structure.

"It's still good," he announced. "Nothing fell down."

"That is because we built it properly."

"I built it properly. You helped."

Sheldon smiled at the correction. "You are right. You built it properly, with my assistance."

"Exactly." Tenchi nodded with satisfaction. "Now we need the roof."

They had discussed the roofing approach yesterday: layers of leaves and smaller branches, woven together to create a covering that would shed water (mostly) and provide shade (definitely). It was not sophisticated construction—a real shelter would require more durable materials—but it would serve Tenchi's purposes.

"We start with the large leaves," Sheldon explained, demonstrating. "Lay them like fish scales, overlapping so water runs down instead of through. Then we add smaller materials on top to hold them in place."

"Why fish scales?"

"Have you ever seen fish scales up close? They overlap in a pattern that lets the fish move smoothly through water. If they were flat against each other, they would catch the water and slow the fish down. The overlapping pattern—" He paused, seeing Tenchi's expression. "Am I explaining too much?"

"No. I like it when you explain. Grandpa explains too, but he uses different words. Your words make pictures in my head."

"That is... very kind of you to say."

They worked together for the next hour, gathering materials and beginning to lay the roof. Tenchi proved adept at selecting leaves of the right size and condition—not too dry (they would crumble), not too fresh (they would curl as they dried)—and he took obvious pride in his contributions.

"I'm a good gatherer," he said, adding another armload to the pile.

"You are. You have an eye for quality."

"What does that mean?"

"It means you can see the difference between good materials and bad materials. Not everyone can."

Tenchi considered this. "Grandpa says I have good eyes. He says it is important for the sword."

"Eyes are important for many things. For building, for repairing, for understanding how things fit together."

"Do you think I could be a builder? When I grow up?"

"You could be anything you want to be. Builder, scientist, priest—" Sheldon gestured toward the shrine. "Whatever you choose, your skills will serve you."

"What if I want to be everything?"

"Then you will have to live a very long time."

"That's okay. I'm planning to live forever."

Sheldon laughed—a real laugh, surprised out of him. "That is an ambitious plan."

"Grandpa says ambitious is good. He says people who are not ambitious do not achieve things."

"Your grandfather is wise. But even wise people eventually..." He hesitated. How did you explain mortality to a five-year-old who had already lost his mother?

Tenchi seemed to understand the hesitation. "I know people die," he said, his voice matter-of-fact. "Mom died. But maybe there's a way not to. Maybe if you're good enough, or smart enough, or something."

"Maybe," Sheldon said quietly. And he thought about his own death, and his strange resurrection, and wondered if maybe—just maybe—Tenchi was onto something.

---

By late afternoon, the roof was half complete.

They stood back to assess their progress. The fort looked more substantial now—still rough, still clearly the work of amateurs, but recognizable as a structure with purpose. The roof section they had finished hung at a slight angle, not quite symmetrical, but stable enough to stay in place.

The leaves they had gathered created a mottled pattern of greens and browns, already beginning to dry and curl slightly at the edges. In a few weeks, they would need to be replaced. But for now, they provided coverage—protection from the sun, at least partial protection from rain.

"It's really a fort now," Tenchi said, his voice filled with wonder. "Before it was just sticks. Now it's something."

"That is how building works. You start with materials that are not useful by themselves. But when you put them together correctly, they become more than the sum of their parts."

"The sum of their parts?"

"It means... each stick on its own is just a stick. But all the sticks together, arranged the right way, become a shelter. The shelter is greater than the individual sticks."

Tenchi considered this. "Like a family?"

The observation startled Sheldon with its insight. "Yes. Exactly like a family. Each person alone is just a person. But together, supporting each other, they become something stronger."

"Mom used to say that. She said our family was small but mighty."

"She was right."

"Tomorrow we can finish the rest," Sheldon said. "And then we can add walls, if you want."

"Walls would be good. For protection."

"Protection from what?"

"From enemies." Tenchi's voice was serious. "Every fort needs protection from enemies."

"What enemies do you have?"

"I don't know yet. But when I have some, I'll be ready." He paused, thinking. "And maybe... maybe the walls can protect other things too. Not just from enemies."

"What other things?"

"From being alone. If I'm in the fort, I'm not alone. The fort keeps me safe and keeps the loneliness out."

The words hit Sheldon like a physical blow. Such wisdom from such a young mouth—such understanding of the deep human need for shelter, not just from weather but from the more existential storms.

"That is very insightful, Tenchi."

"What does that mean?"

"It means you see things clearly. Things that many adults miss."

"Oh." The boy shrugged, as though he had not said anything particularly profound. "Can we come back tomorrow? I want to finish."

"We will finish. I promise."

The logic was impeccable.

They gathered their tools—such as they were—and headed back toward the house. The afternoon light was golden, slanting through the trees, and the forest smelled of spring: new growth, damp earth, the indefinable green scent of things coming alive.

A deer stood in the path ahead of them, its head raised, its dark eyes watching. It was young—a yearling, probably—its coat still showing traces of the spotted pattern it had worn as a fawn.

"Don't move," Tenchi whispered, though he was already frozen in place.

They stood there for what felt like minutes but was probably only seconds. The deer studied them with that particular mixture of curiosity and caution that marked prey animals. Then, apparently deciding they were not threatening, it turned and walked unhurriedly into the underbrush.

"That was beautiful," Tenchi breathed, once it was gone.

"It was."

"Do you think it lives near here?"

"Probably. The shrine grounds are safe—no hunting allowed. Animals learn where they can live without fear."

"That's why the birds are so tame too?"

"Yes. They have learned that humans here will not hurt them."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, processing this. "The shrine protects things," he said finally. "Not just people. Animals too. And the trees and the plants and everything."

"That is what a sacred place does. It creates space for life to flourish."

"I like that. I want to protect things too, when I grow up."

"I believe you will."

"Tsukino-san?" Tenchi's voice was thoughtful.

"Yes?"

"Why do you like building things?"

Sheldon considered the question as they walked. "I like understanding how things work. When you build something, you have to understand all the pieces and how they fit together. It is like a puzzle, but one you create yourself."

"That makes sense." A pause. "Why do you like fixing things?"

"Fixing things is similar. But there is something else, too." He searched for words that a five-year-old could understand. "When something is broken, it cannot do what it was made to do. When you fix it, you give it back its purpose. You make it whole again."

"Like healing?"

"Yes. Very much like healing."

"Is that why you came here? To fix things?"

The question cut deeper than Tenchi could have known. Why had he come here? He had not chosen this destination—the warmth, the system, whatever it was had placed him here. But perhaps there was intention behind that placement. Perhaps he had been sent to fix something.

Or perhaps he was the thing that needed fixing.

"I came here because I needed a place to be," he said finally. "And because this place needed things fixed. It seemed like a good match."

"I think it was a good match too," Tenchi said. "I'm glad you came."

"So am I."

---

Evening brought a different rhythm.

After dinner—another simple meal, leftovers stretched with creativity—Katsuhito announced that he would be meditating and should not be disturbed. He disappeared into a room at the back of the house that Sheldon had not yet explored.

This left Sheldon and Tenchi alone in the main room, the evening stretching before them.

"What do you want to do?" Sheldon asked.

"Tell me a story?"

"What kind of story?"

"A true story. About when you were little."

Sheldon settled onto his cushion, Tenchi arranging himself nearby with the expectant attention of a child waiting for entertainment. The low lamp cast warm shadows across the tatami, creating an atmosphere that invited storytelling.

"When I was little," he began, "I spent summers with my grandmother. She lived in a place called Georgia, in America. It was very different from here—hot and humid, with red dirt and pine trees and insects that made noise all night long."

"What kind of noise?"

"Chirping, mostly. Crickets and tree frogs. And cicadas—do you know what cicadas are?"

"The loud bugs that come in summer? With the shells?"

"Yes. In Georgia, they were everywhere. So loud you could barely hear yourself think. But after a few nights, you got used to it. It became like a lullaby—a song the world sang to help you sleep."

"I like the idea of the world singing."

"My grandmother liked it too. She used to sit on her porch in the evenings, listening. She said the insects were praying—giving thanks for another day, asking for another tomorrow."

"Did you like it there?"

"I loved it there. My grandmother's house was old and full of books and there was always something interesting happening. She had a garden where she grew vegetables, and chickens that laid eggs, and a cat named Marmalade who was very fat and very lazy."

"Why was he called Marmalade?"

"Because he was orange. Like marmalade jam. He had fur the exact color of the marmalade my grandmother made every autumn, from the oranges that grew on a tree by her kitchen window."

Tenchi giggled. "That's a silly name for a cat."

"Maybe. But it suited him. He would lie in the sunny spots on the floor and look just like a puddle of marmalade that had spilled there." Sheldon found himself warming to the story, memories surfacing that he had not thought about in years. "Every morning, my grandmother would wake me up early. She would say, 'Daylight's burning, no time for sleeping.' And we would eat breakfast—eggs from the chickens, sometimes biscuits she made fresh—and then we would work."

"Work like what?"

"Garden work. House work. Whatever needed doing. The tomatoes needed staking, or the fence needed mending, or the gutters needed cleaning. There was always something." He smiled at the memory. "She taught me how to fix things—pipes and doors and anything that broke. She said a person who could fix things would never be useless."

"Grandpa says that too. He says being useful is important."

"He is right. Your grandfather and my grandmother would have understood each other very well. They had the same philosophy about work—that it was not just about accomplishing tasks, but about being the kind of person who could be counted on."

"What else did she teach you?"

Sheldon considered. "She taught me to cook—not fancy cooking, but the kind that fills your stomach and satisfies your soul. She taught me about plants, which ones were food and which ones were medicine and which ones would make you sick. She taught me about weather, how to read the clouds and the wind and know when storms were coming."

"That sounds like a lot of teaching."

"It was. Every day, all summer. And at the time, I thought it was boring sometimes. I wanted to read my books and do my equations. But she insisted." He met Tenchi's eyes. "Now I understand why. She was giving me something more valuable than any book—she was giving me the ability to take care of myself and others. That is a gift that never stops giving."

They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the lamp flickering, the house quiet around them.

"What happened to her?" Tenchi asked. "Your grandmother?"

"She died. A few years ago." The pain was distant now, softened by time and the strange circumstances of his new existence. "She was very old, and she had lived a good life, and when it was time to go, she was ready."

"Were you sad?"

"Very sad. I still miss her." He met Tenchi's eyes. "But I also carry her with me. The things she taught me, the way she treated people, the love she gave me. That does not go away."

Tenchi nodded slowly, his expression thoughtful. "That's what Grandpa says about Mom. He says she's still with us, even though we can't see her."

"Do you believe that?"

"Sometimes. When I dream about her, it feels true. When I'm awake, it feels..." He trailed off, searching for words. "Hard to believe."

"That is normal. Believing and feeling are different things. You can believe something in your head and still feel something different in your heart."

"Is that why grown-ups are confusing?"

Sheldon laughed softly. "That is exactly why grown-ups are confusing."

---

Bath time came next—Tenchi's splashing audible from the main room—and then the quiet process of preparing for bed. Sheldon helped the boy into his pajamas, supervised the brushing of teeth, settled him onto his futon with Usagi-chan clutched to his chest.

The room was dim, lit only by the hallway light spilling through the partially open door. Shadows pooled in the corners, and the sounds of the house settling around them created a gentle backdrop of creaks and sighs.

"Good night, Tenchi."

"Good night, Tsukino-san." A pause. "Will you be here tomorrow?"

"I will be here."

"And the day after?"

"Yes."

"And the day after that?"

"Yes, Tenchi. I will be here."

The boy's eyes were heavy with sleep, but he fought to keep them open. His small hand reached out from under the covers and found Sheldon's larger one.

"I'm glad you came here," he said, his voice drowsy. "Everything feels better when you're here."

"Everything feels better for me too."

"Really?"

"Really. You and your grandfather... you have made me feel welcome. You have made me feel like I belong somewhere."

"You do belong. Here. With us."

The simple certainty of the statement cut through any defenses Sheldon might have raised. This child, who had every reason to be cautious about attachment, who had lost his mother and been left with only an elderly grandfather—this child was choosing to trust again.

"Promise?" Tenchi murmured, the word almost lost to sleep.

"I promise to try. Remember what I said? I cannot promise forever. But I promise to try."

"That's good enough," Tenchi said. And then he was asleep, his breathing evening out, his small body relaxing into rest, his hand still loosely holding Sheldon's.

Sheldon sat with him for several minutes, watching him sleep. The trust in that small face was overwhelming—the vulnerability of a child who had already lost so much, who was slowly learning to let another person in.

He thought about his own childhood, about the distance he had maintained even from people who cared about him. He had told himself it was self-sufficiency, independence, strength. Now he recognized it for what it was: fear. Fear of loss, fear of betrayal, fear of caring too much and being hurt.

Tenchi was braver than he had been. Was braver, perhaps, than he was even now.

He would not betray that trust. Whatever else happened, whatever the warmth had planned for him, he would not disappear from this boy's life without warning. He would be what Tenchi needed—a constant presence, a reliable adult, someone who showed up day after day until showing up became so natural that neither of them questioned it anymore.

---

Later, on the engawa, Sheldon watched the stars.

The week was complete. Seven days in this new life, this new world. He had arrived with nothing—no possessions, no connections, no understanding of where or when he was. Now he had a house being repaired, a place in a household, relationships with people who were beginning to know him.

It was more than he had had in his previous life, in some ways. More connection, more community, more sense of belonging. The scientific work had been fulfilling, but lonely. The long hours in the lab, the focus on research to the exclusion of everything else—it had left him isolated without realizing what he had given up.

Here, isolation was not possible. The shrine required tending. Tenchi required attention. Katsuhito required respect. The village required presence. The web of obligations was also a web of connection, each thread binding him more firmly to this place and these people.

Was this what the warmth had intended? This second chance at belonging?

The stars offered no answers. But then, they never did. They simply shone, ancient light from ancient fires, reminding him of his smallness in the vast machinery of the universe.

That smallness had once troubled him. Had driven him to seek importance through discovery, to leave a mark on the cosmos that would outlast his brief existence. Now it felt different. Comforting, almost. If the universe was so vast, then his struggles and failures were equally small. What mattered was not cosmic significance, but the more modest achievements: a day's work done well, a child comforted, a house made whole.

His grandmother had understood this. Had never sought to be remembered by history, only by the people whose lives she had touched. And she had touched so many lives, in her quiet way. Had made a difference that rippled outward in ways she probably never knew.

Could he do the same? Could he learn to measure his life by that smaller, truer scale?

He was beginning to think he could.

The night deepened around him. The stars wheeled their slow circuit. The crickets sang their ancient songs.

Tomorrow was Monday. Tanaka would come to fix the roof. The next phase of restoration would begin. Life would continue, day by day, step by step, one moment at a time.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside. Then he prepared for sleep, the routines of this new life becoming automatic, natural, right.

The warmth found him as always, gentle and constant, carrying him down into dreams.

In those dreams, his grandmother stood beside the great tree, her hand resting on its bark, her expression peaceful.

"You're doing well," she said. "Keep going."

He woke in the night, the dream still vivid, the words still echoing.

*Keep going.*

He would. He was. Day by day, building a life worth living.

One week down. A lifetime to go.

⁂

---

## Day 8

---

## Monday, April 10, 1989

---

The second week began with rain.

Sheldon woke to the sound of it on the roof—a steady drumming that had started sometime in the night and showed no signs of stopping. The grey light filtering through the shoji screens spoke of heavy clouds and a day that would be spent mostly indoors.

His first thought was of Tanaka and the roof repairs. Would rain delay the work? Probably. Roofing required dry conditions, both for the safety of the workers and the integrity of the materials. The start date might need to be pushed back.

His second thought was of Tenchi, who would be less than pleased about walking to the bus stop in the rain.

He rose, dressed, and went to join the morning routine.

---

The kitchen was warm and bright against the grey day outside.

Katsuhito stood at the stove, stirring something that smelled of miso and green onion. Tenchi was already at the table, dressed for school but looking distinctly unhappy about the weather visible through the window.

"It's raining," the boy announced, as though this were news.

"I noticed," Sheldon said, settling onto his cushion.

"I don't like rain."

"You said the same thing last week."

"I still don't like it. It makes everything wet and cold and my shoes get soggy and then my feet are uncomfortable all day."

"Perhaps you should wear different shoes. Ones that keep water out."

"I don't have different shoes. I have school shoes. School shoes are not waterproof."

Katsuhito set bowls of soup before them without comment, though the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth suggested he was enjoying the exchange.

"The rain will stop eventually," Sheldon offered.

"That's what Grandpa always says. But eventually is not now." Tenchi poked at his soup with his spoon, his expression suggesting that the weather had personally betrayed him.

They ate in relative quiet, the sound of rain filling the silences between conversation. After breakfast, Tenchi gathered his school things with the reluctance of someone facing an ordeal, and the three of them prepared for the walk to the bus stop.

---

The three hundred steps were treacherous in the rain.

Water ran down the stone surfaces in small streams, pooling in the worn spots, making each step a potential hazard. Sheldon went first, testing footing, while Katsuhito followed with Tenchi between them.

"Slowly," Katsuhito said, when Tenchi tried to hurry. "A fall on these steps could be serious."

"I know. You tell me every time it rains."

"And yet you still try to hurry."

They made it to the bottom without incident, though all three of them were thoroughly damp by the time they reached level ground. The village was quiet in the rain, most residents staying inside, the usual morning activity subdued.

The bus stop shelter—a simple wooden structure with a roof and three walls—provided welcome refuge. The two mothers from the previous week were already there, their children fidgeting beside them.

"Masaki-san," Yamada-san greeted. "Tsukino-san. Miserable day."

"The rice farmers will be pleased," Katsuhito observed. "Spring rain is good for the seedlings."

"Spring rain is good for many things. Dry feet are not one of them."

The children huddled together, sharing complaints about the weather with the intensity of people who had discovered a common enemy. Tenchi joined in with enthusiasm, his earlier reluctance forgotten in the face of solidarity.

The bus arrived on time—a minor miracle, given the conditions—and the children boarded with varying degrees of eagerness. Tenchi waved through the window as the bus pulled away, his face already brightening at the prospect of school and friends.

"He forgets quickly," Sheldon observed.

"Children do. It is one of their gifts." Katsuhito turned toward the village. "Come. We should check on the house."

---

The Tsukino property looked different in the rain.

Water ran off the roof in streams, finding paths through the old tiles, pooling in the courtyard where drainage had failed over years of neglect. The building seemed to huddle against the weather, its weathered wood darkening with moisture.

Tanaka was there, despite the rain.

He stood in the courtyard with two younger men—his crew, presumably—all of them in rain gear, examining the building with professional attention. They looked up as Katsuhito and Sheldon approached.

"Masaki-san. Tsukino-san." Tanaka's greeting was brief but not unfriendly. "We came to assess conditions."

"Can you work in this?"

"Not on the roof. Too dangerous—wet tiles are treacherous, and a fall from that height could be fatal." He gestured toward the building. "But we can prepare. There is work to be done inside, and materials to stage. When the rain stops, we will be ready to move quickly."

"What kind of preparation?"

Tanaka led them inside, his crew following. The interior of the house was dim, the rain-grey light filtering weakly through dirty windows. But even in that dimness, Sheldon could see that things had been done.

The main room had been swept clean, the debris they had cleared earlier removed entirely. Tools were arranged along one wall in precise rows—saws and hammers and implements Sheldon did not recognize. Buckets stood near the entrance, ready to catch any water that might leak through.

"We removed the damaged tatami from the upper room," Tanaka explained, leading them up the narrow stairs. "Exposed the floor beneath. There was water damage, as I suspected—you can see here, where the boards have darkened and warped slightly—but it is contained to this corner. We can repair without replacing the entire floor."

Sheldon examined the exposed wood. The damage was visible but not catastrophic—a roughly two-meter square area where water had seeped through over time, staining the boards and causing them to swell slightly. The surrounding floor was sound, the wood still solid and true.

"How do you repair something like this?" he asked.

"We cut out the damaged section completely—follow the joists so we have something to attach to. Then we install new boards, matched as closely as possible to the originals. Sand and finish the entire floor so the repair blends in." Tanaka ran his hand along one of the undamaged boards. "This is good wood. Old growth, properly cured. It has been here for eighty years, perhaps more. With proper care, it will be here for another eighty."

"That is good news."

"Yes. Also, we checked the ceiling in the main room." They descended the stairs again, Tanaka pointing upward. "The water that came through the roof has been absorbed by the ceiling boards. They are stained—you can see the discoloration there, and there—but not rotten. They can be refinished rather than replaced."

"What would refinishing involve?"

"Sanding to remove the stained surface layer. Then treatment with a protective compound—we use a traditional mixture, tung oil and natural resins. It penetrates the wood, seals it against future moisture, and restores something of the original color." Tanaka's voice warmed slightly, the enthusiasm of a craftsman discussing his craft. "The old methods are slower, but they produce better results. Modern sealers sit on the surface. Traditional treatments become part of the wood itself."

Sheldon followed as Tanaka pointed out each area of concern and each silver lining. The roofer's analysis was thorough, practical, delivered with the confidence of someone who had seen hundreds of similar situations and knew exactly what was possible.

One of the younger workers—his name was Hayashi, Sheldon learned—was documenting everything in a notebook, sketching diagrams and noting measurements. The other, Ota, was examining the structural elements with careful attention, testing joints and connections.

"The foundation is sound," Ota reported, emerging from a crawl space Sheldon had not known existed. "Some moisture underneath, but no rot. The supports are solid."

"Good. That was my assessment as well, but it is worth confirming." Tanaka nodded with satisfaction. "This house was built by someone who understood construction. The fundamentals are correct."

"Tsukino Hideo," Sheldon said. "Or his father, perhaps."

"Both, I suspect. You can see different hands in the work—the original construction, then modifications and repairs over the years. Each generation learned from the previous one and added their own knowledge." Tanaka looked around the dim interior with something like respect. "That is how craft is supposed to work. Each generation building on what came before."

"The work will take three days, perhaps four if the weather does not cooperate," Tanaka concluded. "Today and tomorrow, preparation. Wednesday and Thursday, the roof itself. Friday, cleanup and inspection."

"And after the roof?"

"After the roof, you will need to address the tatami. Hashimoto in Kurashiki—Masaki-san knows him—is the best. I have already told him you may call."

Sheldon looked around the dim interior, trying to see past the current state to what the building could become. It was easier now, after a week of imagining. The walls could be cleaned and replastered. The floors could be refinished. The windows could be replaced or repaired. Layer by layer, the neglect could be stripped away, revealing the solid bones beneath.

"Thank you, Tanaka-san. For starting despite the rain."

"Rain does not stop preparation. Only execution." The roofer's expression was almost approving. "You are learning."

---

They left Tanaka and his crew to their work and walked back through the village.

The rain had settled into a steady drizzle, less dramatic than the morning's downpour but no less wet. Few people were out, though Sheldon caught glimpses of activity through windows—a woman folding laundry, an old man reading near a lamp, the ordinary business of life continuing despite the weather.

They passed the grocery store, where Ito-san waved through the window. They passed the temple, where the priest was sweeping the entrance despite the rain. They passed houses and shops and gardens, the fabric of a community that had existed for centuries and would likely exist for centuries more.

"The ceremony yesterday," Katsuhito said, breaking a long silence. "You had questions."

"Many questions. Though I am not sure which ones to ask."

"Start with the one that bothers you most."

Sheldon considered. "The warmth—the presence I feel sometimes—responded to the ceremony. It recognized what was happening, seemed to... approve, perhaps. I do not understand why."

"You assume it is separate from what the ceremony invokes."

"Is it not?"

Katsuhito did not answer directly. Instead, he said: "There are many forces in this world. Some we name, some we do not. Some respond to ritual, some do not. The fact that your warmth responded suggests it recognizes the patterns we use to reach beyond ourselves."

"Patterns?"

"Prayer, offering, focused intention—these are patterns. They have been used by humans for thousands of years, in every culture, in every time. Perhaps they are simply psychological mechanisms, as modern people like to believe. Or perhaps they touch something real, something that exists beyond our understanding."

"You believe the latter?"

"I believe both are possible. I have seen evidence for both." Katsuhito's gaze was distant, looking at something Sheldon could not see. "The shrine has stood for many generations. The rituals have been performed countless times. If they accomplished nothing, would they have persisted?"

"Traditions can persist for reasons other than effectiveness. Social cohesion, cultural identity, the simple comfort of familiar patterns."

"All true. But ineffective traditions tend to fade when circumstances change. The ceremony we performed yesterday has changed very little in centuries. That suggests it serves a purpose that remains relevant."

They walked in silence for a while, the rain pattering on their umbrellas. The street was empty except for them, the village waiting for better weather.

"The warmth in your chest," Katsuhito said finally. "What do you believe it is?"

The question was direct—more direct than anything Katsuhito had asked before. It felt like a test, or perhaps an opportunity.

"I do not know. It came with me when I... when I arrived here. It seems connected to whatever brought me to this place and time." Sheldon paused, considering how much to reveal. "It is not separate from me, exactly. It feels like a part of me that I did not have before. But it also feels like something added, something that has its own awareness."

"Does it guide you?"

"Not explicitly. It responds to things—places, people, moments—but it does not give instructions. It is more like... a companion. A presence that shares my experience without directing it."

"That is unusual," Katsuhito said. "But not unprecedented."

"You have encountered something similar?"

The old man was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was careful, measured—the voice of someone choosing words with precision.

"I have lived a long life. I have seen things that do not fit neatly into modern understanding. I have learned that the world is stranger than we are taught to believe." He met Sheldon's eyes. "I do not know what your warmth is. But I know that you are not a threat. Whatever brought you here, whatever purpose it serves—I believe it is benevolent."

"How can you know that?"

"Because I have watched you for more than a week now. I have seen how you treat my grandson, how you approach your work, how you engage with the world. A person controlled by malevolence would not behave as you do. A person influenced by something dark would show signs of that darkness, even if only in small ways."

"And you see no darkness?"

"I see a man trying to build a life. I see someone who is confused about his circumstances but clear about his values. I see pain—old pain, new pain—but no cruelty. Whatever you carry, it has not corrupted you."

It was, Sheldon realized, a kind of acceptance. Not full trust—that would take longer to earn—but acknowledgment that he had passed some initial test. Katsuhito had been observing him, evaluating him, reaching conclusions based on evidence rather than assumption.

"Thank you," he said.

"Do not thank me. Simply continue as you have begun." Katsuhito's voice softened slightly. "The world is full of mysteries, Tsukino-san. Some are solved; most are not. The presence you carry may remain mysterious forever, or it may reveal itself in time. Either way, what matters is how you live with it."

"How do you suggest I live with it?"

"The same way I suggest everyone live with the mysteries they carry. With attention. With humility. With patience." The old man's pace slowed as they approached the shrine steps. "Accept what you cannot change. Observe what you cannot understand. And act according to what you know is right, regardless of what you do not know."

"That sounds like a philosophy rather than advice."

Katsuhito almost smiled. "All good advice is philosophy. The only question is whether you are willing to apply it."

---

They climbed back up the three hundred steps in the rain.

The ascent was harder than the descent had been—the wet stones required careful placement of feet, and the muscles in Sheldon's legs protested the extra effort of maintaining traction. But they made it without incident, emerging at the top breathless but safe.

The shrine looked different in the rain. The great tree's leaves dripped water in a constant patter, creating a curtain of sound around its trunk. The stone lanterns seemed to glow slightly in the grey light, their surfaces slick and shining. Everything was muted, softened, transformed.

"The shrine is beautiful in the rain," Sheldon said.

"It is beautiful in all weather. But yes, rain reveals a different aspect of its beauty." Katsuhito shed his rain gear at the entrance to the house. "Tea, I think. And then we discuss what work can be done indoors."

---

The morning passed in the rhythm of indoor tasks.

Sheldon helped Katsuhito with shrine maintenance that did not require venturing outside: polishing the metal fittings on ceremonial implements, mending a tear in one of the silk hangings, cleaning the small shrines that dotted the interior of the main hall.

The metal work was particularly interesting. The fittings were brass, mostly—bells and hinges and decorative elements—darkened by age and handling. Katsuhito provided a special polish, a mixture whose formula he said had been passed down for generations, and demonstrated the proper technique: small circular motions, gentle pressure, patience.

"The goal is not to make them new," he explained. "Age has its own beauty. The goal is to remove the dullness while preserving the character."

It was, Sheldon thought, an apt metaphor for many things. Including, perhaps, himself.

The silk hanging was more challenging. The tear was small—perhaps five centimeters—but it occurred in a painted section, where the threads were dyed with colors that had been discontinued decades ago. Simple mending would leave a visible scar.

"We use a technique called kakejiku restoration," Katsuhito said, producing a small kit of tools and materials. "The repair becomes part of the piece's history, but it is done in a way that honors the original work."

He demonstrated, selecting threads from a collection that spanned many colors and weights, finding matches for both warp and weft of the damaged area. The stitching was nearly invisible when complete—not because it was hidden, but because it followed the existing patterns so closely.

"You have done this many times," Sheldon observed.

"The shrine is old. The furnishings are old. Repair is an ongoing process." Katsuhito set aside the completed mending. "This particular hanging was made in the Meiji era—perhaps a hundred years ago. It has been repaired at least three times before. Each repair extends its life while adding to its story."

"Like a ship that has had every plank replaced over time. Is it still the same ship?"

"An ancient question. I believe the answer is yes—the identity persists even as the components change. What matters is the continuity, not the material."

This too felt applicable. Sheldon's body was new, created or modified by whatever force had brought him here. His memories were from another life, another time. Was he still the same person? Or had he become something new that merely remembered being someone else?

He did not have an answer. But the question felt less troubling than it had a week ago. Perhaps identity was not a fixed thing but a process, something you created through your choices rather than something you inherited from your past.

The work was meditative, requiring attention to detail but not intense concentration. Sheldon's hands moved through the tasks while his mind wandered.

He thought about the conversation with Katsuhito, about the warmth and its mysterious origins, about the ceremony and its ancient patterns. He thought about the house in the village, about Tanaka and his crew working despite the rain, about the slow process of restoration that was beginning.

He thought about Tenchi, in school now, probably complaining to his classmates about the weather. About the trust the boy had placed in him, the small hand that had held his as sleep claimed them both.

He thought about his grandmother, and her teachings, and the way she had lived her life. About the continuity between her approach and what he was trying to build here. About the strange gift of a second chance, and the responsibility it carried.

"You are thinking loudly," Katsuhito observed.

"I apologize."

"Do not apologize. Thinking is good. But you should try to think more quietly. It disturbs the calm."

Sheldon was not entirely sure if the old man was joking. He returned his attention to the metal fitting in his hands, trying to empty his mind and simply polish.

"There is a practice," Katsuhito said after a few minutes of silence. "Seishin tōitsu—the unification of spirit. It is the basis of many Japanese arts, from calligraphy to swordsmanship. The idea is to bring the mind into harmony with the task, so that there is no separation between thought and action."

"Like flow state. What psychologists call being 'in the zone.'"

"Perhaps. Though seishin tōitsu is not about achievement or performance. It is about presence. About being fully here, in this moment, with this task. Not thinking about the past or the future, just... being."

"That sounds simple."

"Simple, yes. Easy, no." Katsuhito's polishing never faltered as he spoke. "The mind is like a wild horse. It wants to run where it will, to pursue whatever thought catches its attention. Training it to remain still requires practice and patience."

"How do you train it?"

"The same way you train any skill. Repetition. Attention. Forgiveness when you fail." The old man's voice was gentle. "You are doing it now, in a limited way. Focusing on the motion of your hands, the texture of the metal, the smell of the polish. When your mind wanders, you bring it back. That is the practice."

Sheldon tried to follow the instruction. To narrow his attention to the immediate—the cool brass under his fingers, the faint astringent smell of the polish, the circular motion of the cloth. When thoughts arose (they always did), he acknowledged them and let them go, returning to the sensation of the moment.

It was harder than he expected. His mind kept reaching for something—analysis, evaluation, planning. The habits of a lifetime were not easily set aside. But there were moments, brief and intermittent, when the chatter quieted and there was only this: hands moving, brass warming, light reflecting.

"Better," Katsuhito said, though he had not appeared to be watching. "Much better."

---

Lunch was simple: rice, pickled vegetables, the leftover fish from the previous night's dinner. They ate in the kitchen, the sound of rain providing a constant backdrop.

"This afternoon," Katsuhito said, "I have correspondence to attend to. You are free to use the time as you wish."

"What kind of correspondence?"

"Shrine business. Reports to the regional organization, applications for festival permits, the administrative work that keeps this place functioning." His expression suggested this was not his favorite aspect of priesthood. "Every organization requires paperwork. Even sacred ones."

"I could help, if—"

"Your kanji is improving, but it is not yet sufficient for official documents. Perhaps in a few months." The rejection was gentle, practical. "For now, rest, read, or find other productive activities. The rain should stop by late afternoon. When it does, you might check on the house again."

---

Sheldon spent the early afternoon with his books.

He had accumulated a small collection during his trip to Kurashiki—the history of Okayama Prefecture, the Marcus Aurelius translation, a guide to Shinto shrines, a book about traditional Japanese carpentry that he had found in a second-hand shop. Today he chose the carpentry book, thinking of Hideo's tools and the work that Tanaka was doing on the house.

The book was dense with technical information: joints and joinery, wood selection and treatment, the traditional tools and their proper use. Some of it was familiar—principles that transcended cultural boundaries—and some was completely new. Japanese carpentry, he learned, was a distinct discipline, developed over centuries in isolation, with techniques and approaches found nowhere else in the world.

The joints were particularly fascinating. Western carpentry relied heavily on mechanical fasteners—nails, screws, bolts—to hold pieces together. Japanese carpentry used interlocking joints, cut so precisely that they held through friction and geometry alone. A well-made joint would actually become stronger over time, as the wood settled and the pieces pressed more tightly together.

The book illustrated dozens of these joints, each with its own name and specific application. There were joints for corners and joints for splices, joints that allowed movement and joints that locked pieces rigidly in place. Some were simple, requiring only basic tools and skill. Others were extraordinarily complex, involving multiple interlocking elements that fit together like three-dimensional puzzles.

Sheldon found himself drawn to the diagrams, tracing the lines with his finger, trying to understand how each piece fit with the others. There was a mathematical beauty to them—a sense of problems solved elegantly, of form following function in the most literal way possible.

The most striking difference was the philosophy. Western carpentry, as Sheldon understood it, was primarily about function—building things that worked, that were strong enough and stable enough to serve their purpose. Japanese carpentry was about harmony—building things that worked with their materials, that honored the natural properties of wood rather than forcing it into unnatural shapes.

The selection of wood, for instance, was not simply about finding pieces large enough for the intended purpose. It was about understanding the characteristics of different species, the way grain direction affected strength and flexibility, the way moisture content changed over time. A good carpenter would know where a tree had grown, how it had been oriented, what stresses it had experienced during its life—and would select and position each piece accordingly.

There was a spiritual dimension to the craft, the book explained. Wood was not merely a material but a living thing, with grain and character and preferences. A good carpenter listened to the wood, understood what it wanted to become, and helped it achieve that potential.

This resonated with something deep in Sheldon's understanding. In physics, too, there was a sense of listening—of paying attention to how the universe worked rather than trying to impose your will upon it. The best theories were not inventions but discoveries, revelations of patterns that had always existed.

His grandmother had said something similar about gardening. "The plants know what they want to be," she had told him. "Your job isn't to make them into something else. It's to give them what they need to become themselves."

Perhaps all crafts shared this quality. Perhaps all excellence required a kind of humility—the recognition that you were not creating from nothing but collaborating with forces larger than yourself.

He read until his eyes grew tired, then set the book aside and simply sat, thinking about what he had learned. The rain continued outside, a soft background rhythm, but he barely noticed it. His mind was full of joints and wood and the philosophy of craft.

Could he become a carpenter? Not a master, certainly—that would require years of apprenticeship that were no longer available in the modern world. But perhaps he could learn enough to be competent, to understand what the tools in Hideo's box were for and how to use them properly.

It would be another way of connecting to this place and its traditions. Another thread in the web he was building.

---

The rain stopped around three o'clock.

Sheldon noticed it first as an absence—the constant drumming on the roof fading, the grey light outside brightening slightly. He set aside his book and went to the window to confirm.

The clouds were beginning to break, patches of blue appearing between the grey masses. Sunlight slanted through the gaps, creating beams of gold that swept across the wet landscape. The air would be fresh after the rain, clean and sharp and full of the scent of growing things.

The forest around the shrine sparkled with water droplets, every surface catching the new light and reflecting it back in fragments. Birds emerged from wherever they had sheltered, their calls sharp and bright in the washed air.

He found Katsuhito still at his desk, surrounded by papers covered in characters Sheldon could not yet read. The old man looked up as he entered, his expression suggesting he had been expecting the interruption.

"The rain has stopped. I thought I would check on the house."

"Good. Take an umbrella—it may rain again before evening. Spring weather is unpredictable."

The walk down the steps was easier now, the water having drained away during the afternoon, leaving the stone merely damp rather than treacherous. Sheldon moved carefully nonetheless, conscious of the moss that made certain steps slippery regardless of conditions.

The village was coming back to life. People emerged from their houses, resuming activities that the rain had interrupted. A woman hung laundry on a line, the fabric steaming slightly in the afternoon warmth. An elderly man walked a small dog along the main street. Children's voices echoed from somewhere out of sight, released from indoor confinement.

Several people nodded to Sheldon as he passed—more than had done so a week ago. He was becoming a recognized presence, someone whose face no longer needed to be studied with open curiosity. Progress, of a kind.

The Tsukino property was transformed.

Where this morning there had been pooled water and dripping eaves, now there was organized chaos. Tanaka's crew had been busy: tarps covered the areas where work was being done, protecting materials from any residual moisture. Scaffolding had been erected against the north wall, a framework of bamboo poles and wooden planks that rose to the eave line.

Materials were stacked neatly under protective covers—bundles of tiles, rolls of underlayment, containers of the various compounds that would be used in the repair. Everything was arranged for efficiency, positioned where it would be needed, ready for quick access.

Tanaka himself was on the roof—not working yet, but inspecting, walking the tiles with the careful steps of someone who knew exactly how much weight each surface could bear. His movements were economical, purposeful, the practiced ease of someone who had spent his life at heights.

"Tsukino-san." He acknowledged Sheldon without stopping his inspection. "The rain gave us time. We are ready to begin tomorrow, assuming the weather holds."

"It looks like you accomplished a great deal."

"Preparation is half the work. Perhaps more." Tanaka paused at a spot near the ridge, crouching to examine something closely. "The materials are staged. The damaged areas are marked. The underlayment is ready to be applied. When we start work tomorrow, there will be no delays."

He descended the ladder with the ease of long practice and joined Sheldon in the courtyard.

"Would you like to learn? What we do, why we do it?"

The question was unexpected—craftsmen did not typically invite amateurs into their process. "I would. Very much."

"Then come tomorrow. Early—we start at dawn when the weather is good. Watch and ask questions." Tanaka's expression was difficult to read, but there was something that might have been approval in his eyes. "Not many people care about traditional methods anymore. The young workers want to use modern materials, modern techniques. Faster, they say. Cheaper. But faster and cheaper do not make better."

"You believe the traditional methods are superior?"

"I believe they are appropriate for traditional buildings. Modern materials have their place, but this house was built to work with traditional methods. The tiles, the underlayment, the flashing—all of it was designed as a system. When you replace one element with something modern, you break the system."

It was, Sheldon thought, the same argument that appeared in discussions of heritage and tradition everywhere. The tension between preservation and progress, between honoring the past and embracing the future.

"How do you decide when to use traditional methods and when to use modern ones?"

Tanaka considered the question seriously. "You ask what the building wants. What was it designed for? How was it meant to work? If the original methods still serve the purpose, you use them. If they don't—if circumstances have changed enough that the old ways no longer function—then you adapt. But you adapt carefully, with respect for what came before."

"That sounds like a philosophy rather than a technique."

"It is both. Technique without philosophy produces work that is merely competent. Philosophy without technique produces ideas that cannot be realized." The roofer's voice carried the weight of experience. "You need both. The hands and the heart together."

---

Sheldon stayed for an hour, watching the crew finish their preparations.

They worked with the easy coordination of people who had done this together many times—each person knowing their role, their movements flowing together without need for instruction. Tools were passed without request, tasks were completed without discussion, the entire operation running like a well-designed machine.

He asked questions when appropriate, and Tanaka or one of his crew answered with patience. He learned about the different types of roof tiles, about the underlayment that kept water out even when tiles cracked, about the traditional methods of weatherproofing that had served Japanese buildings for centuries.

It was, he realized, another form of education. His grandmother had taught him practical skills through doing. Tanaka was teaching him through observation and explanation. Different methods, but the same underlying principle: knowledge passed from person to person, generation to generation, accumulating over time into something greater than any individual could create.

When the crew began packing up for the day, Sheldon thanked them and headed back toward the shrine.

---

Tenchi was waiting at the top of the steps.

"You went to the house without me!" The accusation was delivered with five-year-old intensity.

"You were at school."

"I'm not at school now!"

"No. But by the time you got home, I was already there." Sheldon crouched to Tenchi's level. "I went to check on the roof work. Tanaka-san invited me to come back tomorrow to watch them work. Would you like to come too, after school?"

The anger faded, replaced by interest. "Watch them work? On the roof?"

"On the roof. Real craftsmen, doing real work."

"That sounds interesting. Can I ask questions?"

"Some questions. Good questions, as we discussed."

"All my questions are good questions."

"That remains debatable."

They walked back to the house together, Tenchi already full of questions about what Sheldon had seen, what the workers were doing, what the finished roof would look like. The stream of inquiry was constant but no longer overwhelming—Sheldon was learning to navigate it, to answer what he could and deflect what he could not.

"How was school?" he asked, when Tenchi paused for breath.

"It was okay. We learned about maps. And I told Momoko about the fort and she said it sounded stupid but I think she's jealous because she doesn't have a fort."

"Perhaps she could build one."

"I offered to help her but she said forts were for babies. She's wrong, though. Forts are for everyone."

"You are very generous to offer help even after she insulted your fort."

"Mom said you should be nice to people even when they're not nice to you. She said that's how you make them nicer."

"Your mother was wise."

"Everyone says that." Tenchi's voice was matter-of-fact, but there was something softer beneath it. "I wish she could see the fort. I think she would have liked it."

"I think so too."

---

Dinner was fish and vegetables, prepared by Katsuhito with Sheldon's assistance.

The routine was becoming familiar: the preparation of rice, the selection of ingredients, the quiet coordination of tasks. Sheldon was learning the rhythm of this kitchen, the particular way Katsuhito liked things done, the subtle signals that indicated what was needed without words.

Tonight they had fresh fish—mackerel that Katsuhito had obtained from somewhere during the day. Sheldon was given the task of preparing the vegetables while Katsuhito handled the fish, scoring its skin with precise cuts that would help it cook evenly.

"The cuts should be at an angle," Katsuhito explained, demonstrating. "Not too deep—you want to open the flesh to the heat without cutting through to the bone. And space them evenly, about a centimeter apart."

"Why the angle?"

"Aesthetics, partly. The diagonal lines are more pleasing to the eye than straight cuts. But also function—angled cuts expose more surface area to the heat without weakening the structure of the fish."

Everything in this kitchen had a reason. The placement of tools, the sequence of steps, the way ingredients were prepared. It was like the Japanese carpentry Sheldon had been reading about—every choice deliberate, every element serving multiple purposes.

Tenchi set the table with the care of someone who had been taught that this task mattered. He aligned the bowls precisely, positioned the chopsticks at the correct angle, folded the napkins with attention to symmetry.

"You are becoming skilled at this," Sheldon observed.

"Grandpa says practice makes perfect."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"You always say that."

"Because it is always true."

They ate in the comfortable rhythm that had established itself over the past week. Tenchi shared more details about school—the maps they had studied, the classmate conflicts, the teacher's stories about her cat. The rain had stopped completely by now, and late afternoon light filtered through the windows, warming the room.

"Yamamoto-san's cat had kittens," Tenchi reported. "Four of them. She says when they're old enough, we might be able to see them."

"That sounds pleasant."

"She says one of them is orange. Like Marmalade." Tenchi looked up at Sheldon with obvious intent. "I've been thinking about that story you told. About your grandmother's cat."

"Have you?"

"If we had a cat, I could name it Marmalade too. In honor of the original Marmalade."

Katsuhito made a sound that might have been amusement or might have been warning.

"Having a pet is a significant responsibility," Sheldon said carefully, recognizing a minefield when he saw one. "It requires daily care, attention to health needs, and a commitment that lasts for many years."

"I know. I'm responsible. I take care of Kabutaro."

"Kabutaro is a beetle. Cats are considerably more demanding."

"But also more fun. Kabutaro doesn't purr."

This was, Sheldon had to admit, a valid point.

"Perhaps we can discuss it when the kittens are old enough to be seen," Katsuhito said, in a tone that clearly meant the discussion was tabled for now. "There is no point in debating something that cannot happen for weeks."

Tenchi accepted this with the reluctance of someone who knew he was being deflected but lacked the leverage to push further. "Fine. But I'm going to keep thinking about it."

"I would expect nothing less."

After dinner, while Katsuhito supervised Tenchi's bath, Sheldon washed the dishes and thought about the day.

The rain had changed things—not dramatically, but subtly. The house restoration was beginning, the work made visible and tangible. His conversations with Katsuhito were deepening, moving past surface pleasantries into territory that felt genuinely meaningful. The routines were no longer just routines but the foundation of a life.

He thought about the philosophy Katsuhito had shared. Accept what you cannot change. Observe what you cannot understand. Act according to what you know is right.

It was similar to what the Stoics had taught—similar to the Marcus Aurelius he had been reading. Perhaps all wisdom converged on the same essential truths, discovered independently by different traditions at different times.

The warmth stirred slightly, as though acknowledging the thought. It was quiet most of the time now, present but not intrusive. Whatever it was, it seemed content to simply exist alongside him, sharing the experience without demanding attention.

Eight days. A little over a week. And already, he could not quite remember what it had felt like to be alone.

Perhaps that was the greatest change of all—not the practical adjustments or the new skills, but the simple fact of connection. He had people now. People who expected him to be present, who would notice if he were gone, who had begun to factor him into their lives.

His grandmother had taught him that this was what mattered most. Not achievements or recognition, but relationships. The people you loved and the people who loved you back.

He had not understood, then. Had pursued solitary excellence, had told himself that connection was a distraction from more important work.

Now, standing in a kitchen that was not his own, washing dishes that he had helped dirty, listening to the sounds of a boy splashing in a bath and an old man's patient corrections—now he understood.

---

That evening, the sky cleared completely.

The stars appeared with particular brilliance, the atmosphere washed clean by the rain. Sheldon sat on the engawa and watched them emerge, constellations appearing one by one as the sky darkened.

The warmth in his chest was quiet, present but not active. It seemed to like these moments—the peaceful endings of days, the gradual transition from activity to rest. Perhaps it was learning the rhythms of this life just as he was.

He thought about Tanaka's invitation to watch the roof work tomorrow. About the craft and tradition represented in that work, the chain of knowledge stretching back through generations. About his own place in that chain—not as a roofer, but as someone who was learning to appreciate what craft meant.

His grandmother had understood craft. Had applied it to everything she did, from cooking to gardening to the simple act of conversation. She had believed that anything worth doing was worth doing well, and that doing things well required attention, practice, and humility.

He was trying to live by that philosophy now. Trying to approach each task with the care it deserved, each relationship with the attention it required. Trying to be not just competent but excellent, in the small ways that mattered.

Was it working? He could not tell from the inside. But the signs were encouraging. Katsuhito's growing trust. Tenchi's attachment. The villagers' cautious acceptance. The work that was beginning on the house, the life that was beginning to take shape.

Eight days. A beginning.

Tomorrow there would be more work, more learning, more slow accumulation of the pieces that made a life. The roof would be repaired. The fort would be expanded. The connections would deepen.

One day at a time. One step at a time. One moment at a time.

The stars wheeled overhead, eternal and indifferent and beautiful. The crickets began their nightly chorus. The warmth hummed quietly in his chest, a companion in the darkness.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Tomorrow would come soon enough.

Tonight, he rested.

⁂

## Day 9

---

## Tuesday, April 11, 1989

---

Sheldon woke before the sun.

The darkness outside was not complete—a faint grey light was beginning to seep over the mountains to the east, the first hint of dawn filtering through the shoji screens. But it was early, earlier than he usually rose, the household still wrapped in silence.

Tanaka had said to come early. Dawn, he had said, when the weather was good. And the sky visible through the window suggested the weather would cooperate today—no clouds, no rain, just the clear stillness of a spring morning.

He dressed quietly, moving with care to avoid disturbing the others. The house made its usual sounds around him—the creak of old wood, the distant drip of water somewhere in the plumbing, the settling of a structure that had stood for generations—but no human sounds. Tenchi and Katsuhito were still asleep.

He left a note on the kitchen table, written carefully in his improving handwriting: *Gone to observe Tanaka-san's work. Will return for lunch.* Then he slipped out into the pre-dawn grey.

---

The shrine was different in the near-darkness.

The familiar shapes were all present—the torii gate, the stone lanterns, the great tree with its sacred rope—but they seemed larger somehow, more imposing. Shadows pooled in unexpected places, and the silence had a weight to it that the daytime bustle of birds and wind did not allow.

Sheldon paused at the top of the three hundred steps, looking out over the landscape below. The village was invisible in the darkness, marked only by a few scattered lights—early risers, perhaps, or businesses preparing for the day. The sky was lightening moment by moment, deep blue giving way to paler shades at the horizon.

He thought about his grandmother, who had also been an early riser. "The best part of the day," she had called it. "When the world is quiet and you can hear yourself think."

He had not appreciated it then, had preferred to sleep until necessity dragged him from bed. But now, standing in the cool silence of pre-dawn, he understood. There was a quality to these hours that the rest of the day did not possess—a clarity, a stillness, a sense of possibility that faded once the world woke up.

The descent was careful in the dim light, each step requiring attention. The stone was damp with dew, slippery in places, and a fall here would be dangerous. He moved slowly, testing each placement, his body learning the steps in a new way.

By the time he reached the bottom, the sky had brightened enough to see by. The village was stirring—smoke rising from chimneys, doors opening, the first sounds of activity drifting through the streets. He nodded to an elderly man walking a small dog, received a curious look in return.

The Tsukino property was already alive with work.

---

Tanaka and his crew had been there for some time, judging by their progress.

The scaffolding from yesterday had been reinforced and extended, now reaching the full length of the north wall where the most serious damage lay. Materials had been unstaged and organized—tiles laid out in neat rows, tools arranged on portable workbenches, the various compounds and sealants ready for use.

Tanaka himself was on the roof, walking the tiles with the same careful attention Sheldon had observed the day before. But today his movements were different—more purposeful, more directed. He was not assessing; he was planning, working through the sequence of steps that would transform intention into action.

"Tsukino-san." Hayashi, one of the younger workers, noticed him first. "You came early, as Tanaka-sensei suggested."

"I did not want to miss anything."

"You are in time. We will begin the actual removal soon." Hayashi gestured toward the roof. "Once the damaged tiles are off, you will be able to see the underlayment—how it was constructed, how it failed, how we will repair it."

"Thank you for explaining."

"Tanaka-sensei instructed us to answer your questions. He says it is good to have someone interested in the traditional methods." Hayashi's expression suggested mild curiosity about why an American would care about Japanese roofing techniques, but he did not ask.

Sheldon found a position that would allow him to observe without being in the way—near the corner of the building where he could see both the roof and the staging area below. He settled in to watch.

---

The work began slowly, methodically.

Tanaka descended from the roof and gathered his crew for a brief conference—too quiet for Sheldon to hear clearly, but the gestures suggested they were reviewing the plan for the day. There was a rhythm to their discussion, the give-and-take of people who had worked together long enough to develop their own shorthand.

Then, with the coordination of people who had practiced their roles countless times, they began.

Ota went up first, carrying a canvas bag of tools. His climbing was economical—no wasted movements, each handhold and foothold chosen with precision. He positioned himself at the corner where the damage was worst, near where Sheldon had seen the stains on the ceiling below, and began the careful process of removing tiles.

Each one was lifted individually, the mortar beneath it loosened with a small flat tool that looked like a thick-bladed knife. The technique was precise—too much force and the tile might crack; too little and it would not come free. Ota seemed to find the exact pressure instinctively, each tile releasing with a soft grinding sound.

The freed tiles were checked for damage—held up to the light, tapped gently, examined for cracks both visible and hidden. Those that were salvageable went into one pile, lowered carefully to Hayashi below on a rope-and-pulley system. Those too cracked or worn to be trusted went into another pile, destined for disposal.

Watching, Sheldon realized that most were being saved. The visible damage—the three cracked tiles Tanaka had mentioned—was just the surface. Beneath, many more tiles were still sound, just shifted out of position by years of settling and the gradual movements of the house beneath them.

"The roof is like a puzzle," Hayashi explained, noticing Sheldon's attention. "Each tile fits with its neighbors in a specific way. When one shifts, it affects the others around it. Those shift further, affecting the ones around them. Over time, small movements accumulate into large problems."

"A cascade effect."

"Yes. What starts as a single tile moving a few millimeters becomes, over years, a pattern of displacement that extends across the entire roof section." Hayashi gestured at the exposed area. "You can see it now—how the tiles near the damage point are closer together than they should be, compressed by the shifting of their neighbors."

"So the repair is partly about repositioning?"

"Exactly. Some tiles need to be replaced, yes. But many just need to be returned to where they belong, with fresh mortar to hold them in place." He gestured at the pile of salvaged tiles. "We will clean these, check them for hidden cracks, remove the old mortar, and use them again. Traditional tiles last for generations if properly maintained."

Sheldon thought about the parallel to his own situation. He had been displaced, shifted out of his original position in space and time. Was he being repositioned now? Finding a new place where he fit, where his presence made the whole pattern work better?

It was a fanciful thought, but it resonated with something true.

The underlayment was exposed gradually as the tiles came off. Sheldon could see layers—first the tiles themselves, their curved shapes interlocking like fish scales, then a bed of mortar that had held them in place, then sheets of cedar bark arranged in overlapping patterns, then wooden boards that formed the structural base of the roof.

Each layer had a purpose, he realized. Each contributed something essential to the whole. Remove any one and the system would fail.

"The bark is the key," Hayashi said, following his gaze. "It is naturally waterproof and flexible. When water gets past the tiles—and it always does, eventually, through cracks or wind-driven rain—the bark channels it away before it can reach the wood beneath."

"But the bark in that corner has failed."

"Yes. You can see where it has compressed and cracked." Hayashi pointed to the exposed section, and Sheldon could indeed see the damage—the bark was darker there, more brittle-looking, with visible fissures that would allow water through. "When bark fails, water reaches the boards. The boards absorb it, swell, warp. Eventually rot sets in. We are fortunate that the damage was caught before it reached that point."

"How much longer before the rot would have started?"

"Another rainy season, perhaps two. The boards show discoloration but no softness yet. Another year of water infiltration would have changed that."

Tanaka joined them, having finished directing Ota's work on the upper sections.

"You are asking good questions," he said. "Most people do not care about what is beneath the surface. They see only the tiles, only the visible part of the roof."

"The tiles are what you see. The bark is what protects you."

"Precisely." Tanaka's expression suggested approval. "A roof is a system—many parts working together, each essential, each dependent on the others. Understanding one part without the others is incomplete understanding. To truly know a roof, you must know all of it."

"That seems like a philosophy that extends beyond roofing."

"All good craft extends beyond itself. The principles that make a good roofer also make a good carpenter, a good farmer, a good priest. Attention to detail. Respect for materials. Understanding of systems. Patience." He gestured toward the ongoing work. "These are not roofing skills—they are life skills. Roofing is simply where I learned them."

---

The morning passed in the rhythm of careful work.

Sheldon watched as the crew removed damaged materials, cleaned surfaces, prepared the area for reconstruction. Each step was deliberate, unhurried—there was an efficiency to their movements, but no rushing. Quality required time, and time was built into the process.

Around mid-morning, Tanaka called a break. The crew descended from the roof and gathered around a thermos of tea that someone had brought. Sheldon was invited to join them.

"You have been patient," Tanaka observed. "Most observers grow bored and leave."

"I am trying to understand. Boredom would mean I had stopped learning."

"A good philosophy." Tanaka sipped his tea. "What have you learned so far?"

Sheldon considered. "I have learned that traditional roofing is more complex than I assumed. I have learned that the visible elements—the tiles—are only part of the system, and perhaps not the most important part. I have learned that repair is not just about fixing what is broken but about understanding why it broke and preventing the same failure in the future."

"All correct. What else?"

"I have learned that the work requires patience. That rushing would compromise quality. That the crew's coordination comes from long practice, not just instruction."

Tanaka nodded slowly. "You see clearly. That is rare."

"My grandmother taught me to observe before judging. To understand before acting."

"She was wise."

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"Because it is true." Tanaka set down his tea. "Your grandmother and my grandfather would have understood each other. He taught me the same things—to look before you leap, to measure twice and cut once, to respect the materials and the work."

"Is that why you became a roofer?"

"Partly. It is the family trade—my grandfather taught my father, my father taught me. But I also chose it. The work suits me. I like being able to see the results of my labor, to know that what I build will protect people for years to come."

"That is similar to why I became interested in repair work."

"The house?" Tanaka gestured toward the building behind them. "You intend to open a repair shop?"

"Eventually. When the restoration is complete. It seems like useful work—something the village needs."

"It does need it. Since Hideo-san stopped working, people have had to go to the city for repairs. Many things go unfixed because the trip is too much trouble." Tanaka's expression was thoughtful. "You would be welcomed. But you would also need to earn trust."

"I understand that."

"Do you? Trust is not given quickly here. The village is old, the families are old, the relationships are old. A newcomer—especially a foreign newcomer—must prove himself over time. Years, perhaps."

"I am prepared to take that time."

"Good. That is the right answer." Tanaka rose, signaling the end of the break. "Now, back to work. The underlayment replacement begins next. You will want to watch closely."

---

The underlayment work was, as Tanaka had promised, educational.

The damaged cedar bark was removed in sections, each piece examined before disposal to understand how it had failed. Some pieces had simply degraded with age—the natural oils that made the bark waterproof had dried out over decades, leaving the material brittle and permeable. Other pieces had been damaged by movement, cracked where tiles had shifted and put pressure on the layers beneath.

"This bark is perhaps sixty years old," Tanaka said, holding up a section for Sheldon to see. "It has done its job well. But nothing lasts forever."

"Where does the replacement bark come from?"

"There is a supplier in Kyoto who specializes in traditional materials. The bark is from a specific type of cedar, harvested and prepared according to methods that have not changed in centuries." Tanaka set down the old bark and lifted a new piece for comparison. "See the difference? The new bark is darker, more flexible. The oils are still fresh. It will take years to cure fully, but during that time, it will bond with the surrounding materials and become part of the roof."

The installation was methodical. Hayashi and Ota worked from the bottom up, laying each piece with careful attention to overlap. The edges had to align precisely—too much overlap and the roof would be uneven; too little and water might find its way through.

"We use no adhesive," Tanaka explained. "The bark holds itself in place through friction and geometry. Each piece locks with its neighbors. When all pieces are in place, the system is self-supporting."

"Like the joints in Japanese carpentry."

"Exactly. The same principles apply. You create structures that hold together through their own design, not through external fasteners that can fail."

Sheldon thought about this as he watched the work continue. In his scientific career, he had worked with systems—complex arrangements of components that produced emergent behavior. A roof was simpler than the experiments he had designed, but the underlying logic was similar. Understand the relationships, optimize the interactions, create something greater than the sum of its parts.

Perhaps all skilled work shared this quality. Perhaps excellence in any field required the same fundamental understanding of how things fit together.

---

By late morning, the underlayment repair was well underway.

The new cedar bark was being installed with the same methodical care that characterized all their work. Each piece was positioned precisely, its overlap measured and adjusted, its edges aligned with its neighbors. The crew worked in silence mostly, communicating through gestures and the occasional brief word.

Sheldon excused himself reluctantly—he had promised to return for lunch, and the walk back up the three hundred steps would take time. But he had seen enough to understand the basic process, and Tanaka had invited him to return tomorrow when the actual tile work would begin.

"Tomorrow will be more interesting," the roofer promised. "Today is foundation work—important but not dramatic. Tomorrow, you will see the craft."

"I look forward to it."

"Bring questions. The tile work is complex—there are techniques I have not even touched on yet. Cutting tiles to fit around edges. Setting them at the proper angle. Ensuring the overlap is consistent." Tanaka's voice carried the enthusiasm of someone who genuinely loved their work. "The tiles are what people see. They must be perfect."

Sheldon bowed his thanks and headed toward the village street.

The village was fully awake now, the streets busy with the ordinary traffic of a weekday morning. Housewives moved between shops, shopping bags in hand. An elderly man sat on a bench near the temple, reading a newspaper. Children's voices echoed from the school building, released for a morning break.

He walked through familiar territory—past Ito-san's grocery store, where she waved through the window; past the temple, where the priest was sweeping fallen petals from the stone steps; past houses and shops he was beginning to recognize. Each building had its own character now, its own place in his mental map of the village.

Near the start of the shrine path, he encountered Nakamura-san—the elderly man who had known Hideo, who had offered to share stories about the village's past.

"Tsukino-san." The old man's greeting was warm. "I heard you were watching the roof work this morning."

"News travels quickly."

"In a village this size, everything travels quickly." Nakamura-san's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Tanaka's apprentices are not known for their discretion. By noon, everyone will know that the American spent the morning asking questions about underlayment."

"I hope that is not a problem."

"Problem? No, no—quite the opposite. People are impressed. They say you are taking the restoration seriously, learning the proper methods instead of just paying someone else to handle it." He nodded approvingly. "That is how Hideo-san would have done it. He insisted on understanding everything about his house, even the parts he could not do himself."

"I am trying to honor what he built."

"You are succeeding." Nakamura-san shifted his weight, leaning more heavily on his cane. "When you have time—when the roof work is finished—come visit me. I have photographs of the house as it was in Hideo-san's prime. Before his wife died, before he withdrew from the world. You would learn much from them."

"I would like that very much."

"Good. I will expect you." The old man continued on his slow way, leaving Sheldon with more to think about.

He felt like he belonged here.

It was a strange sensation, one he had rarely experienced in his previous life. His scientific work had been isolating by nature—long hours alone with equations, collaborations that were professional rather than personal, relationships that existed in service of the work rather than for their own sake. He had told himself this was what excellence required, what the work demanded.

Here, walking through a village where people nodded to him by name, where his presence was expected rather than surprising, where even casual encounters carried warmth, he felt connected in a way that was unfamiliar and deeply satisfying.

Was this what he had been missing? All those years of solitary achievement, had he been depriving himself of something essential?

The climb up the three hundred steps was hard, as always. His legs had adapted to the daily ascents, but the effort remained real. Each step was a choice, a commitment to the life he was building at the top of this mountain.

Halfway up, he paused to catch his breath and look back at the village below. Small buildings, narrow streets, green rice paddies stretching toward the distant hills. A landscape that had looked essentially the same for centuries, that would likely look the same for centuries more.

He was part of it now, in some small way. Part of its daily rhythms, its seasonal ceremonies, its ongoing story. The thought was both humbling and exhilarating.

---

Lunch was simple: rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables.

Katsuhito had prepared it while Sheldon was away, and the old man listened with apparent interest as Sheldon described what he had observed.

"Tanaka is a good teacher," Katsuhito said. "He does not often take students—his sons went to university instead of learning the trade—but he has the instinct for it."

"He seems to enjoy explaining the work."

"He enjoys finding people who want to learn. There is a difference." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "The traditional crafts are dying. Young people go to the cities, take office jobs, forget the skills their grandparents knew. Tanaka sees this, mourns it, tries in his small way to preserve what he can."

"Is that why he invited me to observe?"

"Partly. He also genuinely likes you—I can tell by how he speaks of you. You showed respect for the work before you understood it. That matters to craftsmen."

Sheldon considered this. In his scientific career, he had often been impatient with preliminary explanations, eager to skip to the complex material. The idea that respect for fundamentals was itself a form of expertise was new to him.

"What will you do this afternoon?" Katsuhito asked.

"I thought I would work on the fort with Tenchi, after he returns from school. Yesterday we did not have time."

"Good. The boy has been talking about the fort constantly. He will be pleased."

"Has he mentioned the kittens?"

Katsuhito's expression suggested mild suffering. "He has mentioned little else. Apparently, the orange one is 'exactly like Marmalade' and would be 'the perfect pet' for our household."

"I apologize if my story contributed to this campaign."

"You are not responsible for his enthusiasm. Tenchi finds reasons for wanting things; he does not need them provided." The old man rose to clear the dishes. "We will discuss the matter when the time comes. For now, diversion is the better strategy."

---

The afternoon stretched ahead, quiet and unscheduled.

Sheldon spent part of it in practice—the seishin tōitsu that Katsuhito had introduced the day before. He found a quiet corner of the engawa, where the afternoon sun created a warm patch on the wooden planks, and sat.

The position itself was challenging—he was not used to sitting cross-legged for extended periods, and his hips protested the configuration. But Katsuhito had said that the discomfort was part of the practice, that learning to observe the body's complaints without reacting to them was itself a form of training.

He closed his eyes and tried to narrow his attention to the present moment.

It was harder today than it had been yesterday. The mind wanted to review what he had learned at the house—the layers of the roof, the techniques for removing tiles, the philosophy Tanaka had shared about craft extending beyond itself. It wanted to plan for tomorrow's observation, to catalogue the questions he should ask. It wanted to think about the repair shop and what it would require, about the conversations with Nakamura-san and Ito-san, about the web of relationships he was building.

Each time a thought arose, he acknowledged it and let it go, returning to the sensation of breath, the feeling of wood beneath him, the sound of wind in the trees.

The breath was the anchor, Katsuhito had said. Not something to force or control, just something to observe. Breathing happened whether you attended to it or not; the practice was simply to attend, to notice the rise and fall, the slight pause between inhale and exhale.

Progress was incremental. Minutes of focus punctuated by minutes of wandering. But the practice felt valuable anyway—a training of attention that would serve him in everything else. Each time he noticed his mind had wandered and brought it back, he was exercising a muscle. Each return was itself the practice, not a failure of it.

His grandmother had done something similar, he realized. Not meditation in the formal sense, but a quality of presence that allowed her to focus completely on whatever task was at hand. When she gardened, she gardened. When she cooked, she cooked. When she sat on the porch in the evening, she sat fully, not reaching for the next thing but simply being where she was.

He had not understood this as a skill. Had thought she was simply less ambitious, less driven, less interested in the larger questions that had always consumed him. Now he recognized it as a form of mastery—the ability to be fully present, to engage completely with the moment rather than always reaching toward something else.

His scientific work had required concentration, but it was a different kind. The concentration of analysis, of problem-solving, of pushing toward understanding. This was simpler—the concentration of simply being, of accepting what was present without trying to change or understand or improve it.

Could he learn this? At forty-three—or twenty-three, depending on how you counted—could he develop habits that had eluded him for decades?

He thought perhaps he could. The warmth in his chest seemed to agree, stirring slightly in what felt like encouragement. It was quiet most of the time now, this warmth, present but not demanding. Perhaps it too was learning patience, learning to simply be rather than always reaching for something more.

When he opened his eyes, nearly an hour had passed. The shadows had shifted, the warm patch of sun moved to a different part of the engawa. He felt different—not transformed, exactly, but settled. More grounded. As though some restless part of him had finally found permission to be still.

He rose carefully, his legs protesting the return to movement, and went to prepare for Tenchi's return.

---

Tenchi arrived home in a flurry of energy.

"Tsukino-san! You went to the house without me again!"

"It was before dawn. You were asleep."

"You could have woken me up!"

"Your grandfather would not have approved of me waking you before school."

Tenchi's expression suggested that Katsuhito's approval was a minor consideration in the face of missed opportunities. But he moved on quickly, his attention jumping to the next subject.

"Can we work on the fort now? Please? The roof needs to be finished and I have ideas about the walls and—"

"After you change out of your school clothes. And after you have a snack."

"I don't need a snack."

"You always say that, and then you complain about being hungry while we work."

"That was one time!"

"It was three times."

Tenchi grumbled but complied, disappearing into his room to change while Sheldon prepared a simple snack of rice crackers and sliced apple. The boy returned in record time, dressed in old clothes suitable for forest work, his earlier objections apparently forgotten.

"Ready!"

"Did you wash your hands?"

A pause. A guilty look. A retreat to the bathroom.

"Now I'm ready!"

---

They walked to the fort together, following the now-familiar path through the forest.

The light was different at this time of day—softer, more golden, the late afternoon sun slanting through the canopy at angles that created long shadows and patches of warmth. Tenchi moved through the forest with the confidence of someone who had spent years exploring these paths, occasionally pointing out things that Sheldon had not noticed before.

"That tree has a beetle home in it," he said, gesturing at an old oak with a hollow in its trunk. "Not rhinoceros beetles—different ones, smaller. I checked yesterday during recess. They're building something inside."

"Building something?"

"A nest, I think. Or maybe just arranging things. Beetles are very busy. Kabutaro is always moving things around in his jar."

"Perhaps they find meaning in the arrangement."

"Maybe. Or maybe they just like being busy."

The structure had survived the rain—the framework was solid, the partial roof still in place. But the leaves had flattened and darkened with moisture, compressing under the weight of the water they had absorbed. Some repairs would be needed before they could continue building.

"We need to replace some of the roof covering," Sheldon observed. "The wet leaves will rot if we leave them."

"How do we replace them?"

"The same way we put them on in the first place. Remove the damaged material, add new material in its place." He looked at Tenchi. "This is what I learned this morning, watching Tanaka-san work on the house. Repair is about understanding what failed and why, then fixing it properly."

"So we're doing the same thing? Just smaller?"

"Exactly. The principles are the same whether you're repairing a roof on a house or a roof on a fort. You assess the damage, identify what needs to be replaced, prepare your materials, and then do the work carefully."

Tenchi considered this. "So learning about the house helps with the fort?"

"And learning about the fort helps with understanding the house. Each teaches you something about the other." Sheldon crouched beside the structure, examining where the water damage was worst. "See here? The leaves in this section are pressed flat and starting to turn dark. If we leave them, they'll begin to decompose, and then water will get through to the branches beneath."

"And the branches would get wet and maybe rot?"

"Eventually, yes. Though branches are more resistant than the leaves. The point is that each layer protects the next. When one layer fails, the others are exposed."

They worked together for the next two hours, removing flattened leaves, gathering fresh materials from the forest floor, rebuilding the sections of roof that needed attention. The work was not difficult—simple labor that occupied the hands while leaving the mind free for conversation.

Tenchi talked about school, about his friends, about the ongoing saga of the kittens. The orange one had opened its eyes yesterday, apparently, and was "the cutest thing I've ever seen, even cuter than Kabutaro, and you know how cute Kabutaro is."

"I do know," Sheldon agreed. "You have mentioned his cuteness several times."

"He's very cute. But the kitten might be cuter. I haven't decided yet." Tenchi carefully positioned a large leaf, overlapping it with its neighbors as Sheldon had demonstrated. "Is this right?"

"Almost. Angle it a bit more—you want the water to run off, not pool in the crease."

"Like this?"

"Perfect."

They continued in comfortable rhythm, each finding their role in the work. Tenchi gathered materials and placed them according to Sheldon's instructions; Sheldon checked the placements and made adjustments where needed. It was collaboration without hierarchy, shared effort toward a common goal.

"Momoko wants one of the kittens too," Tenchi said, after a while. "A grey one. But her mother says they can't have pets because of her father's allergies."

"That is unfortunate."

"I told her she could visit our kitten whenever she wanted. If we get one. Which we should. Because it would be good for the shrine."

"How would a kitten be good for the shrine?"

"Shrines have cats all the time! I've seen pictures. The cats chase away mice and look decorative and... and help with prayers."

"Help with prayers?"

"Maybe. I'm not sure about that part. But definitely the mice." Tenchi's voice carried the conviction of someone who had thought through their argument carefully. "And cats are calming. People like to pet cats. It would make visitors feel more welcome."

"We do not have many visitors."

"We might have more if we had a cat."

Sheldon had to admit there was a certain logic to the argument. Though he suspected Tenchi was working backward from the desired conclusion to the supporting reasons—a technique he recognized from his own younger years.

"These are all points for discussion," he said neutrally. "When the time comes."

"The time will come soon. The kittens are almost old enough."

"And your grandfather will make the decision."

"Maybe you could help convince him?"

"I do not think interfering in household decisions is appropriate for a guest."

"But you're not just a guest. You're..." Tenchi trailed off, searching for the right word. "You're part of us now."

The simple statement struck Sheldon with unexpected force. Part of us. Not a guest, not a visitor, but part of the family.

"Even so," he said, his voice slightly rough, "the decision belongs to your grandfather."

Tenchi sighed with the weariness of someone who had tried every angle and found none of them workable. "Fine. But I'm not giving up."

"I would expect nothing less."

---

As they worked, Tenchi's chatter gradually slowed, becoming more thoughtful.

"Tsukino-san? Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"When you came here—when you first arrived—were you scared?"

The question was unexpected. Sheldon considered how to answer.

"Yes," he said finally. "I was scared. I did not know where I was, or why I was here, or what was going to happen. Everything was unfamiliar."

"What did you do? When you were scared?"

"I did the next thing that needed to be done. I found food, found shelter, found people who could help me. I focused on the immediate problems because the larger questions were too big to answer all at once."

Tenchi nodded slowly, processing this.

"Mom was scared too, I think. Before she died. She tried to hide it, but I could tell." His voice was quiet, matter-of-fact. "She kept doing normal things—cooking dinner, helping with my homework, reading me stories. Even when she was scared."

"That is very brave. Doing normal things when you are scared."

"Is it?"

"Yes. Fear wants you to stop, to freeze, to wait for the danger to pass. Doing normal things despite the fear takes courage."

"Do you still do normal things when you're scared?"

"I try to. It is not always easy. But your mother was right—keeping to routines helps. It reminds you that life continues, that there are things worth doing, that the fear does not have to control you."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, his hands still working on the roof covering.

"I get scared sometimes," he admitted. "At night, mostly. I think about Mom, and about how Grandpa is old, and about what would happen if..."

He did not finish the sentence. He did not need to.

"Those are real fears," Sheldon said carefully. "It is normal to have them. But I want you to know something. If anything happened to your grandfather—anything at all—I would not leave you alone. I would take care of you. For as long as you needed."

Tenchi looked up, his eyes bright. "You mean it?"

"I mean it. I cannot promise that nothing bad will ever happen—no one can promise that. But I can promise that you will not face it alone."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

The boy's small body relaxed slightly, some tension he had been carrying released. He returned to his work with renewed energy, as though the conversation had lifted a weight.

They finished the roof repairs and began work on the walls, placing larger branches to create wind barriers. The structure was becoming more substantial now—recognizably a fort, a place of shelter and security.

"It's really good," Tenchi said, stepping back to admire their work. "Better than any fort I've seen in books."

"You have seen many forts in books?"

"Some. Castles, mostly. But this is better because it's real."

"Reality does have certain advantages."

---

They returned to the house as the afternoon light was beginning to fade.

Katsuhito met them at the door, his expression suggesting he had been tracking their activities.

"The fort progresses?"

"The fort progresses excellently," Tenchi announced. "We fixed the roof and started the walls. Soon it will be the best fort in the whole prefecture."

"An ambitious claim."

"An achievable claim," Tenchi corrected. "With enough work."

Bath time followed, then the familiar routine of dinner preparation. Sheldon helped in the kitchen, his role now established—he washed and chopped vegetables while Katsuhito handled the more complex tasks.

"You spoke with him," Katsuhito said quietly, while Tenchi was occupied elsewhere. "About serious things."

"He asked about fear. About what happens when people you love..."

"Ah." The single syllable carried understanding. "He worries about that. More than he shows."

"I told him I would take care of him. If anything happened."

Katsuhito was silent for a moment. Then, without looking up from his work: "Thank you. For saying that. For meaning it."

"I do mean it."

"I know. That is why I am thanking you."

---

Dinner was fish and rice and vegetables, eaten in the comfortable rhythm that had become their custom.

Tenchi dominated the conversation initially, describing the fort in elaborate detail, outlining plans for future expansion. But eventually his energy flagged, the day's activities catching up with him.

"Bed," Katsuhito said, when Tenchi's head began to droop. "No arguments."

"I'm not... that tired..."

"The yawning suggests otherwise."

Tenchi went without protest, too exhausted to maintain his usual resistance. Sheldon helped him into pajamas, supervised teeth-brushing, settled him into his futon with Usagi-chan.

"Tsukino-san?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For the promise."

"You are welcome. Sleep now."

The boy was asleep almost instantly, his breathing evening out, his small face peaceful.

Sheldon sat with him for a few minutes, as he had begun to do each night. Watching him sleep, thinking about the trust that had been placed in him, feeling the weight of his promise.

He would keep it. Whatever else happened, whatever the warmth had planned, he would keep this promise.

---

Later, on the engawa, Sheldon sat with Katsuhito in the darkness.

The stars were brilliant tonight, the sky clear and cold. The Milky Way stretched overhead, a river of light flowing across the heavens. In the silence, each sound seemed amplified—the chirp of crickets, the rustle of wind in the great tree, the distant call of an owl.

"The boy talked to you about his fears," Katsuhito said. "That is significant."

"I was surprised. He has not mentioned such things before."

"He does not mention them to anyone. Not even to me." The old man's voice was thoughtful. "He carries more than he shows. The loss of his mother... it left wounds that have not fully healed."

"How could they? She died when he was so young."

"Young, yes. But not too young to understand. Not too young to grieve." Katsuhito was quiet for a moment. "He saw her decline. Saw her grow weak, saw her pain, saw her try to hide it for his sake. That is a heavy burden for a child."

"He said she was scared but kept doing normal things."

"She did. She was determined that he would have as much normalcy as possible, for as long as possible. Right up until the end, she was reading him stories, checking his homework, pretending everything was fine." The old man's voice cracked slightly. "She was very brave. Braver than I knew how to be."

"You were brave too. You took care of him. You have taken care of him ever since."

"Necessity. Not bravery. A child needed someone. I was the only one available." But there was something in his tone that suggested the distinction mattered less than he pretended.

They sat in silence for a while, the weight of the conversation settling around them.

"You made him a promise," Katsuhito said finally. "About taking care of him. If something happens to me."

"Yes."

"Did you mean it?"

"I meant it."

"Good." The old man's voice was firm. "I am not planning to die soon—I have too much work to do—but it is good to know that he would not be alone. That someone would be there."

"I will be there. For as long as he needs."

"That may be a long time."

"I have time."

Katsuhito turned to look at him in the darkness. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him.

"You are becoming part of this family," he said. "Not just a guest, not just a helper. Part of it."

"I am trying."

"You are succeeding." A rare warmth in the old man's voice. "I did not expect this, when you arrived. Did not expect to trust you so quickly, to include you so readily. But here we are."

"Here we are."

The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and eternal. The crickets sang their endless song. The warmth in Sheldon's chest hummed quietly, acknowledging something—the progress, perhaps, or the promises being made.

Nine days. Just over a week. And already, he had found something he had not known he was looking for.

A family. A purpose. A place to belong.

Tomorrow there would be more work on the roof, more learning about the craft. Tenchi would go to school and come home with more stories about kittens. The routines would continue, the relationships would deepen, the life he was building would become more solid.

But tonight, in the darkness with the stars overhead, Sheldon allowed himself to feel what he felt without analysis or reservation.

Gratitude. Connection. Hope.

The warmth wrapped around him like a blanket, gentle and constant, as though confirming what he already knew.

He was home.

⁂

## Day 10

---

## Wednesday, April 12, 1989

---

The second dawn departure was easier than the first.

Sheldon's body was beginning to accept this new rhythm—early rising, the quiet hours of pre-dawn, the careful descent of the three hundred steps in grey light. He moved with more confidence today, his feet finding the familiar stones even in the dimness.

The note he left was shorter this time: *Observing tile work. Back for lunch.* Katsuhito and Tenchi would understand.

The shrine was peaceful in the near-darkness, the great tree a massive silhouette against the lightening sky. He paused at the top of the steps for a moment, breathing in the cool morning air, feeling the warmth in his chest stir slightly—as though acknowledging another day, another opportunity.

Then he descended.

---

The house was already alive with activity when he arrived.

The underlayment work from yesterday had been completed in his absence—the new cedar bark was in place, its darker color marking the repaired section against the weathered grey of the original. The surface was smooth, ready for the tiles that would protect it for the next several decades.

Tanaka was on the roof again, this time with a selection of tiles laid out before him like a palette of colors. The salvaged tiles from the removal process had been cleaned and sorted; beside them, new tiles waited—matching the traditional curved shape but slightly darker, their surfaces unmarked by years of exposure.

"Tsukino-san." Tanaka's greeting was brief, his attention on the work. "You came. Good. Today you will see why this is called a craft and not merely a job."

Sheldon found his observation position from the day before and settled in to watch.

---

The tile work began with selection.

Each tile, Tanaka explained, had its own character—subtle variations in curve, in thickness, in the way light played across its surface. Mass production created tiles that were nominally identical, but traditional tiles were made by hand, and hands were never perfectly consistent.

"This is not a defect," Tanaka said, holding up two tiles that looked identical to Sheldon's untrained eye. "This is an advantage. See here—this tile curves slightly more at the edge than this one. The difference is perhaps two millimeters. But on a roof, two millimeters matters."

He held both tiles at an angle, letting the morning light play across them. Now Sheldon could see it—the subtle difference in curvature, the way shadow fell differently across each surface.

"On a flat section of roof, either would work," Tanaka continued. "But at the corner, where the angle changes, the first tile will sit better. It was made for that spot, even if the maker did not know it at the time."

"How do you know which tile goes where?"

"Experience. Practice. And listening." Tanaka set the tiles down gently, treating them with the respect one might give to living things. "The tiles tell you what they want, if you pay attention. You hold them, turn them, feel how they want to sit. A wrong tile feels wrong—it resists, it wants to be somewhere else. A right tile settles into place like it was always meant to be there."

It sounded mystical, but watching Tanaka work, Sheldon began to understand. The roofer handled each tile with care, considering it briefly before either placing it or setting it aside for a different location. His hands moved with the unconscious grace of someone who had performed these actions thousands of times.

The process was not random—there was a logic to it, a system—but it was not purely mechanical either. It was something in between: intuition built on decades of practice, knowledge so deep it had become instinct.

"In the old days," Tanaka continued, working as he spoke, "master roofers would know every tile on a roof by heart. They would remember which tile went where, how each one fit with its neighbors. When a tile cracked, they could find its replacement from a pile of hundreds, matching the exact curve and thickness needed."

"That seems impossible."

"It seems impossible until you do it for forty years." A hint of amusement in Tanaka's voice. "The mind is capable of more than we believe. We simply do not ask enough of it. We accept limits that are not real limits, boundaries that exist only because we have never tried to cross them."

Sheldon thought about his own scientific work—the years of practice that had made certain calculations automatic, the pattern recognition that allowed him to see solutions others missed. Perhaps it was the same principle applied to different material.

"My grandmother used to know every plant in her garden," he said. "Hundreds of plants, and she could identify each one by a single leaf, a fragment of stem. I thought it was a gift. Perhaps it was just practice."

"Both. A gift developed through practice, or practice that reveals a gift—they are the same in the end." Tanaka positioned another tile, adjusted it fractionally, moved on. "The important thing is to begin. The expertise comes later, if you give it time."

---

The setting of tiles was methodical, precise.

Each tile was placed in sequence, starting from the bottom edge of the roof and working upward. The overlap had to be exact—too much and the tiles would not sit flat; too little and water might penetrate the gaps. Tanaka used no measuring tools, judging the placement by eye and touch alone.

"The overlap is three sun," he said, using the traditional Japanese measurement. "About nine centimeters. But exact measurement is less important than consistent measurement. If every tile overlaps the same amount, the pattern will be true."

The mortar came next—a mixture that Hayashi prepared below and passed up in small batches. It was different from the mortar Sheldon knew from Western construction: finer, more flexible, designed to cushion the tiles rather than rigidly fix them in place.

"Western roofs fight the weather," Tanaka explained, applying mortar with practiced strokes. "They try to be immovable, unchanging. Japanese roofs work with the weather. They flex, they shift, they breathe. That is why they last."

"Don't the tiles come loose?"

"Sometimes, after earthquakes or severe storms. That is expected. We check after each major event, reposition what has shifted, replace what has cracked. The roof is not a finished thing—it is a living system that requires ongoing care."

This philosophy resonated with something Sheldon had been thinking about. In physics, the most elegant theories were not the ones that fought against the nature of reality but the ones that worked with it. The universe had its own logic; the scientist's job was to understand that logic, not to impose a different one.

Perhaps the same was true of life. Perhaps the goal was not to force the world into the shape you wanted but to understand its shape and find your place within it.

---

The morning passed in focused work.

Sheldon watched as row after row of tiles was set, the pattern emerging gradually like a photograph developing in solution. What had been bare underlayment became a surface of interlocking curves, each tile protecting the ones below it, the whole system creating a barrier against the elements.

The crew worked in near-silence, communicating through gestures and brief words. Ota handled the tiles at the far end of the repair area while Tanaka worked the section nearest the corner, where the angles were most complex. Hayashi moved between them, supplying mortar and materials, clearing debris.

Around mid-morning, they encountered a challenge: the corner required tiles to be cut at angles that did not match any of the salvaged pieces.

"This is where the craft becomes art," Tanaka said, selecting a tile for cutting. "Anyone can set tiles in straight rows. But corners, valleys, ridges—these require understanding that cannot be taught. Only learned."

He produced a cutting tool unlike anything Sheldon had seen—a curved blade with a wooden handle, designed specifically for shaping roof tiles. The cutting was done in small increments, each stroke removing a thin strip of material, the tile gradually reshaped to fit its unique location.

"You could not use a modern power tool for this," Tanaka said, working with patient strokes. "Power tools remove material too quickly—you cannot adjust as you go. This tool"—he held it up—"was made by my grandfather's brother. It has been cutting tiles for eighty years."

"And it still works?"

"Better than new. The steel has been sharpened and seasoned a thousand times. The edge holds better now than it did when it was first forged." Tanaka tested the tile against the corner, made two more cuts, tested again. "There. Perfect."

The tile fit into place as though it had grown there, its edges meeting its neighbors in seamless curves. Sheldon found himself impressed not just by the skill but by the philosophy behind it—the patience to work slowly, the willingness to let the material guide the process, the trust that decades of practice would produce the right result.

---

During the morning break, Sheldon asked about the tools.

"You said your grandfather's brother made the cutting blade. Is toolmaking a family tradition as well?"

"It was." Tanaka sipped his tea, his gaze distant. "The family had two branches—one made tools, one used them. My branch are the roofers. My cousins' branch were the smiths."

"Were?"

"The last smith died fifteen years ago. His sons chose other paths." Tanaka's voice was matter-of-fact, but there was loss beneath it. "The tools that remain are precious. When they finally break or wear beyond repair, there will be no replacements of equal quality."

"Could modern smiths not recreate them?"

"Perhaps. If they studied the old methods, if they apprenticed for years as my ancestors did. But no one has time for that now. It is faster to buy machine-made tools from a catalog." He set down his tea. "Faster, yes. But not better."

Sheldon thought about Hideo's tools, waiting in the house below. Hand-forged chisels and planes, made by a father for a son before the war destroyed so much. They were part of the same tradition that Tanaka was describing—a web of craft and care that had sustained communities for centuries.

"I have some old tools," he said carefully. "From the previous owner of the house. I do not know enough to use them properly."

"What kind of tools?"

"Carpentry. Hand-forged, from what I can tell. Perhaps seventy or eighty years old."

Tanaka's attention sharpened. "Hideo-san's tools? I remember hearing about them—his father was a toolmaker in Osaka before the war. The tools were supposed to be exceptional."

"They appear to be. I am afraid to use them incorrectly."

"Bring them sometime. Let me see." The roofer's expression suggested genuine interest. "Good tools deserve to be used. They were not made to sit in boxes."

"I will. Thank you."

---

By late morning, the tile work was nearly complete.

The repaired section blended with the original roof in a way that surprised Sheldon—the new tiles were slightly darker, yes, but the pattern was continuous, the curves flowing from old to new without visible seam. In a year or two, after sun and rain had worked their effects, even the color difference would fade.

"It looks as though it was never damaged," he said.

"That is the goal." Tanaka stood back to examine the work with a critical eye. "A good repair should be invisible. The house should look as it always looked—whole, complete, without obvious intervention."

"But you know the repair is there."

"Of course. And the house knows. And the materials know. But a stranger walking past would see only a roof that is doing its job. That is enough."

There was something profound in this approach—the idea that craft was not about displaying skill but about serving purpose. A truly excellent repair was one that did not call attention to itself, that allowed the repaired object to simply exist as it was meant to exist.

It was the opposite of much modern work, where visible complexity was often prized over invisible elegance. Sheldon thought about scientific papers he had read—dense with mathematics, impressive in their complexity, but often obscuring rather than illuminating the underlying truths. The best papers had been the simple ones, the ones that made difficult things look easy.

Perhaps craft was always like this. Perhaps excellence in any field meant making the difficult look natural, the complex look simple, the repaired look whole.

---

The crew began cleanup, gathering tools and materials for transport.

Tomorrow, Tanaka said, they would address the north side of the roof—a smaller area requiring less work than the corner had demanded. Friday would be inspection and finishing work. By the weekend, the roof would be complete.

"You have been a good observer," Tanaka said, as Sheldon prepared to leave. "You asked questions, you listened to answers, you did not interfere with the work. Not everyone can do that."

"I wanted to understand."

"Most people want to understand. Few are willing to do what understanding requires—to watch, to wait, to let knowledge come in its own time." He offered a slight bow. "You are welcome to observe tomorrow as well, if you wish. The work will be simpler, but there are always things to learn."

"I would like that. Thank you, Tanaka-san."

"Thank me by using what you learn. Knowledge that sits unused is no better than ignorance."

---

The walk back through the village felt different today.

Something had shifted in Sheldon's understanding—not just of roofing, but of craft itself, of the philosophy that underlay traditional work. He found himself seeing things with new eyes: the way a fence post was set, the angle of a shop's awning, the pattern of stones in a garden path. Each was the result of decisions, of choices made by someone who understood their craft.

The village was full of such choices. Generations of craftsmen had built these structures, maintained them, passed them on. Every building was a repository of skill and knowledge, a physical record of people who had known how to make things right.

And now much of that knowledge was fading. The young went to cities, the old died without apprentices, the traditions that had sustained communities for centuries were disappearing like morning mist.

Sheldon could not save all of it. Could not even save most of it. But perhaps he could save some—could learn what he could, preserve what he could, pass on what he could. It was not much, in the face of such vast loss. But it was something.

Nakamura-san was sitting on a bench near the shrine path, as though waiting.

"Tsukino-san. You have been watching the roof work again."

"I have. Tanaka-san is an excellent teacher."

"He speaks well of you too." The old man shifted his weight on the bench, his cane resting against his knee. "He says you ask good questions. That you understand the importance of what he does, even though you come from a world where such work is not valued."

"I am trying to understand."

"That is more than most do." Nakamura-san gestured toward the bench beside him. "Sit for a moment. I have something to tell you."

Sheldon sat, curious. The old man was quiet for a moment, gathering his thoughts. The morning sounds of the village continued around them—a dog barking in the distance, a child's voice from one of the houses, the clatter of dishes being washed.

"I knew your house when it was new," Nakamura-san said finally. "I was young then—perhaps twenty. Hideo-san was my age, newly married, just taking over the carpentry business from his father."

"I did not realize you knew him so well."

"We were friends, once. Good friends." The old man's voice carried the particular weight of memories that had not been revisited in years. "We worked together on several projects—he the carpenter, I the assistant. I was not skilled with my hands, but I could carry materials, hold things steady, do the simple work that freed him for the complex."

He paused, looking down at his aged hands.

"I learned much from watching him work. The way he approached problems—patient, methodical, never rushing. The way he treated his materials—with respect, as though the wood had feelings that must be considered. The way he smiled when a joint fit perfectly, when a surface was smooth as glass."

"He was brilliant, you know," Nakamura-san continued. "Not just skilled—brilliant. He could look at a problem and see solutions no one else could see. He could make wood do things that seemed impossible. I once watched him create a cabinet with seventeen interlocking pieces, no nails, no glue—just geometry and precision. It was like magic."

"What happened? Between you?"

"Life happened. He married, I married. Our wives were different people with different friends—Hideo-san's wife was quiet, preferred solitude, while mine was social, always gathering people for events. We saw each other less and less. Then my wife died, and I withdrew into grief for a long time. By the time I emerged, Hideo-san had withdrawn into his own world. We nodded in passing but rarely spoke."

The old man fell silent, his gaze distant, seeing something that existed only in memory.

"I regret that," he said finally. "We had decades when we could have been friends and were not. Decades when we lived in the same village, walked the same streets, could have shared the simple pleasures of companionship. But we let those opportunities pass, always assuming there would be time later, always telling ourselves that next month, next year, we would reconnect."

"And then he died."

"And then he died. And the chance was lost forever."

They sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the story settling around them.

"Why are you telling me this?" Sheldon asked.

"Because I see you building connections here. Building relationships that matter—with Masaki-san, with young Tenchi, with Tanaka and the villagers. You are doing what I failed to do. You are weaving yourself into the fabric of this community."

Nakamura-san turned to meet his eyes, his expression fierce despite his aged face.

"Do not make the mistake I made. Do not let friendships fade through neglect. Do not assume there will always be time later. The time passes faster than you think, and one day you wake up and everyone you loved is gone, and you are left with nothing but regrets."

Sheldon absorbed this in silence. The warning was clear, and it resonated with things he already knew—his grandmother's teachings, his own regrets about the connections he had failed to maintain in his previous life.

In his scientific career, he had been like Nakamura-san's version of Hideo—brilliant perhaps, but isolated. Focused on work to the exclusion of relationships. Letting friendships fade because there was always another experiment, another paper, another conference demanding attention.

He had died alone. No family at his bedside, no friends to mourn him. Just the cold fact of a body failing, and a consciousness that had not known where to go next.

"Thank you for telling me," he said. "I will remember."

"Good." Nakamura-san rose slowly, his old bones protesting. "Now go. You will be late for lunch, and that grandson of Masaki-san's will be disappointed if you are not there when he returns from school."

---

Lunch was rice and grilled fish, prepared by Katsuhito with his usual efficiency.

"The roof work progresses?" the old man asked, as they ate.

"Nearly complete. Tomorrow and Friday are finishing work. By the weekend, it should be done."

"Good. Then you can contact Hashimoto about the tatami." Katsuhito's tone suggested he had already been thinking about next steps. "The house will not be livable until the floors are addressed."

"Tanaka-san mentioned him. He said Hashimoto is the best."

"He is. Also the most expensive. But quality in tatami matters—poor tatami breeds insects and develops odor. Good tatami improves with age."

"Like good tools."

Katsuhito looked at him with something like surprise. "Yes. Exactly like good tools. You are learning."

"Tanaka-san is a good teacher. As are you."

"Hmm." The old man returned to his food, but there was a hint of pleasure in his expression. "This afternoon, if you are willing, I could use assistance with the main hall. The spring cleaning has been delayed."

"Of course. What needs to be done?"

"Everything, essentially. The hall has not been properly cleaned since autumn. Dust has accumulated, surfaces need polishing, the floor requires attention." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "It is work that should be done before the next ceremony. Work that I have been... postponing."

"Why postponing?"

"Because it is tedious, and I am old, and my body no longer enjoys crawling about on floors." A rare admission of weakness. "Your assistance would be welcome."

"Then you have it."

---

The main hall was larger than Sheldon had realized.

From outside, the building had seemed modest—a traditional structure, certainly, but not enormous. Inside, the space opened up in ways that defied the exterior dimensions. High ceilings disappeared into shadows above, their wooden beams dark with age and smoke from centuries of incense. Multiple alcoves branched off the central area, each with its own purpose that Sheldon could not quite determine.

The central area was where ceremonies were held—he recognized it from the spring planting ritual he had observed. The altar stood at the far end, draped in white cloth, its surfaces bearing the implements of worship. Smaller shrines occupied niches in the walls, some containing objects, others empty, their purposes obscured by time.

And every surface needed attention.

Katsuhito provided instruction, demonstrating the proper techniques for each type of cleaning. There was a particular way to hold the broom—angled to gather dust without scattering it. There was a specific pattern for wiping floors—always moving toward the door, never back over cleaned areas. There was a method for polishing wood that Sheldon recognized from the ceremonial implements they had worked on before.

"The goal is not merely to clean," Katsuhito explained, demonstrating the floor-wiping technique. "The goal is to care for the space. To show respect for what it is and what it represents."

"How is that different from cleaning?"

"Cleaning removes dirt. Caring maintains the spirit of a place. You can clean something without caring for it—robots in factories do this every day. But you cannot care for something without also cleaning it." He handed Sheldon a damp cloth. "Try. Feel the difference."

They worked together in comfortable silence, each taking a section, methodical in their progress. The dust of months lifted and dispersed, revealing surfaces that had been hidden beneath layers of neglect.

The floor was made of broad planks, worn smooth by generations of footsteps. In places, Sheldon could see grooves where feet had passed most frequently—paths of accumulated use, the building's memory of all the people who had walked here before.

"This hall has stood for three hundred years," Katsuhito said, during a brief pause to rest. "Perhaps longer—the records are unclear. Generations of my family have maintained it."

"Generations of your family have been priests here?"

"Yes. The Masaki have tended this shrine since it was founded." Something flickered in Katsuhito's expression—a secret, or perhaps just old pain, quickly masked. "We have... responsibilities. Duties that pass from father to son."

"Will Tenchi inherit those duties?"

"Perhaps. Perhaps not. The world is changing, and not all traditions survive change." The old man's voice was neutral, but there was weight beneath it—the weight of decisions not yet made, futures not yet determined. "We will see what the future brings."

It was, Sheldon realized, the closest Katsuhito had come to discussing the shrine's deeper significance. There were layers here that he had not yet been permitted to see—histories and meanings that went beyond simple religious observance.

He did not push. Some things revealed themselves in their own time. And pushing, he had learned, often delayed rather than accelerated the revealing.

They continued to work, the afternoon sun slanting through high windows, the dust motes floating in the beams of light like tiny worlds drifting through space. The work was physical but not exhausting—rhythmic, meditative, allowing the mind to wander while the hands stayed busy.

Sheldon found himself thinking about the great tree, about the warmth in his chest, about the questions that still had no answers. He thought about his grandmother, who had cleaned her house the same way—not as a chore but as an act of devotion, caring for the space that sheltered her life.

"My grandmother used to say that a clean house was a prayer," he said, during another pause. "That taking care of your home was a way of giving thanks for having one."

"She was right." Katsuhito leaned on his broom, his expression thoughtful. "Every culture has understood this, in its own way. The home is sacred because it shelters us. The temple is sacred because it connects us to what is greater than ourselves. Both deserve our care."

"But you are cleaning a temple that is also your home."

"Yes. The shrine is both—a place of worship and a place of dwelling. I live with the sacred every day." A slight smile. "It is a privilege and a burden. Some days more privilege, some days more burden. But always both."

---

By mid-afternoon, the hall was transformed.

The floors gleamed with the soft patina of well-maintained wood. The metal fixtures reflected light with renewed brightness. Even the air seemed cleaner, lighter, as though the space itself had been refreshed.

"Good work," Katsuhito said, surveying the result. "This will serve well for the next months."

"It was my pleasure."

"Was it?" A slight smile. "Most people do not find pleasure in scrubbing floors."

"Most people have not had a grandmother who taught them that all work has dignity. That taking care of things is its own reward."

"Your grandmother sounds like someone I would have liked to know."

"She would have liked you too. She had great respect for people who maintained traditions."

They cleaned and stored the supplies together, the rhythm of cooperation now familiar. Then Katsuhito excused himself for his afternoon correspondence, leaving Sheldon to wait for Tenchi's return.

---

Tenchi arrived with a announcement.

"The kittens are old enough to visit!"

He burst through the door with the energy of someone who had been containing exciting news all day, his school bag already sliding off his shoulder.

"Yamamoto-san said we can come see them after school tomorrow! All of them—the orange one and the grey one and the two striped ones! They're big enough to walk around now and they're so cute and—"

"Breathe," Sheldon suggested.

Tenchi paused, inhaled deeply, and continued at only slightly reduced speed. "Can we go? Please? Tomorrow after school? It won't take long and the kittens are so cute and Momoko is going and Kenji is going and—"

"You will need to ask your grandfather."

"I already asked! He said yes as long as you go with me!" Tenchi's eyes were bright with anticipation. "So can you? Please?"

"If your grandfather has approved, then yes. I will accompany you."

"Yes!" Tenchi's celebration was physical—a jump, a spin, a near-collision with the door frame. "This is the best day ever! Well, maybe not ever, but the best day this week! Thank you, Tsukino-san!"

"You are thanking me for saying yes to something I had no reason to refuse."

"I'm thanking you for being there. For being the grown-up who comes with me so I can go see kittens." He stopped his celebration long enough to look at Sheldon with sudden seriousness. "Not everyone has that. Momoko's dad works too much—he can never go anywhere. But you're here. You're always here."

The simple statement carried more weight than Tenchi probably knew.

"I try to be," Sheldon said.

"I know. That's why I'm thanking you."

---

The rest of the afternoon passed in comfortable activity.

They did not go to the fort—Tenchi was too excited about the kittens to focus on construction work—but they walked through the shrine grounds together, Tenchi providing commentary on everything they passed.

"That lantern is the oldest one. Grandpa says it was here before any of the buildings. Someone put it here and then built everything else around it."

"Do you know who?"

"No. Grandpa doesn't know either. He says some things are lost and we just have to accept it." Tenchi paused by the lantern, examining its weathered surface. "I think it's nice that it's mysterious. Not everything needs to have answers."

"That is a very mature perspective."

"Grandpa says that too. He says I'm old for my age." A small shrug. "I don't know what that means. I'm five. That's how old I am."

They continued past the preparation shed, past the training clearing where Sheldon had observed Katsuhito's sword practice, into a section of the grounds he had not explored before. The forest pressed closer here, the maintained paths giving way to rougher trails.

"This is the back part," Tenchi explained. "Grandpa says I shouldn't come here alone because there are old wells and things that could be dangerous. But with a grown-up, it's okay."

"What is back here?"

"Old stuff. Buildings that fell down a long time ago. And..." Tenchi lowered his voice, as though sharing a secret of great importance. "The other tree."

"The other tree?"

"Not as big as the big tree. But old. Very old." He led Sheldon along a narrow path, pushing through undergrowth that suggested this route was rarely used. Branches caught at their clothes; ferns brushed against their legs. The forest felt different here—older, wilder, less touched by human presence. "Grandpa doesn't talk about it much. But I've heard him praying to it sometimes, when he thinks no one is listening."

The path wound between fallen stones—the remnants of buildings, Sheldon now saw. Moss-covered walls, barely recognizable as structures, their original purpose lost to time and weather. A well, its opening covered by a heavy wooden lid, stood to one side of the path.

"What buildings were these?" Sheldon asked.

"I don't know. Grandpa says they were here before the shrine, maybe. Or maybe part of an older shrine that got rebuilt." Tenchi shrugged with a child's acceptance of mystery. "They fell down a long time ago. Before Grandpa was born, even."

They emerged into a small clearing, and Sheldon understood.

The tree was not large—perhaps half the size of the great tree near the main hall—but it had the same quality of presence, the same sense of age and significance. Its bark was deeply furrowed, its branches twisted by centuries of growth, and there was a shimenawa rope around its trunk, marking it as sacred.

Unlike the great tree, which seemed to reach upward toward the sky, this tree's branches spread outward, creating a canopy that sheltered the clearing beneath it. The light that filtered through was green and soft, giving the space an enclosed, protected feeling.

The warmth in Sheldon's chest stirred, responding to the tree's presence as it had responded to the great tree before. But the quality of the response was different—where the great tree evoked something like hope, something forward-looking and bright, this tree evoked something more like... remembrance. As though it held within itself the memories of everything that had passed beneath its branches.

Two presences, two acknowledgments, two recognitions across whatever distance separated them.

"Grandpa says this tree is different," Tenchi whispered, his voice instinctively hushed in the tree's presence. "He says the big tree is... is..." He screwed up his face, trying to remember the exact words. "The big tree is hope. This tree is memory."

"What does that mean?"

"I don't know. But he says it like it matters. Like really, really matters." Tenchi moved closer to the tree, reaching out as though to touch the bark, then pulling his hand back. "I can feel something. Can you feel it?"

"Yes," Sheldon said quietly. "I can feel it."

The warmth in his chest hummed with recognition—with acknowledgment of something ancient and significant. Whatever these trees were, they were connected to whatever had brought him here. The system, the warmth, the strange resurrection—all of it was part of a larger pattern that he was only beginning to glimpse.

They stood in silence for a moment, the tree seeming to regard them with ancient patience. Birds sang in the branches overhead, but softly, as though they too felt the weight of this place.

"Sometimes I come here to talk to Mom," Tenchi said, his voice very small. "I know she's not here. But... it feels like a good place to talk to her. Like maybe she can hear me, somehow."

"Perhaps she can."

"Do you think so?"

Sheldon considered the question carefully. A week ago, he would have answered with scientific skepticism—with the certainty that consciousness ended at death, that communication with the deceased was wishful thinking, that meaning existed only in the minds of the living.

Now, standing before a tree that his chest insisted was somehow significant, in a body that should not exist, in a time he had no right to inhabit, his certainties seemed less certain.

"I think," he said finally, "that we do not know everything about how the world works. I think that love does not disappear when people die. I think that if there is any way for the dead to hear us, your mother would find it."

Tenchi nodded slowly, apparently satisfied with this answer. Then he tugged at Sheldon's hand.

"We should go back. It'll be dinner soon."

"Yes. We should."

But as they walked back through the ruined buildings and the overgrown path, Sheldon's mind was full of new questions. Two sacred trees. Hope and memory. And a warmth that recognized both, that seemed to be connected to whatever power they represented.

The mysteries were multiplying. But perhaps that was as it should be. Perhaps understanding would come not through rapid revelation but through gradual accumulation—layer upon layer, like tiles on a roof, each piece connecting to those around it until the whole pattern became clear.

---

Dinner was simple but satisfying: rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, grilled fish.

The conversation flowed easily—Tenchi's excitement about tomorrow's kitten visit, the progress on the roof, the hall cleaning that had taken most of the afternoon. Katsuhito listened and commented, occasionally steering the discussion with the subtle skill of long practice.

"The roof will be finished soon," he observed. "And then the real restoration begins."

"The tatami?"

"The tatami, the walls, the plumbing, the electrical. Layer by layer, the house will be made whole." Katsuhito's voice was thoughtful. "It is a large undertaking. Months of work, perhaps longer."

"I have months."

"Do you?" The old man's gaze was sharp. "You arrived with no clear plans, no deadline, no obligations. That remains true?"

"It does. Whatever brought me here did not specify a duration. I am free to stay as long as the staying serves purpose."

"And does it serve purpose?"

Sheldon considered how to answer. "I believe so. I am learning things I did not know I needed to learn. Building relationships I did not know I needed to build. The person I was... he achieved much but understood little. Perhaps being here is teaching me what he missed."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "That is a good reason to stay. Better than most."

"What would be a bad reason?"

"Running from something rather than toward it. Hiding rather than building. Using this place as an escape rather than a foundation." The old man's expression was neutral, but his words carried weight. "I have seen people who came to places like this seeking refuge from their own lives. They never found what they sought, because what they sought was not here. It was in themselves."

"And you do not think I am doing that?"

"No. I think you are someone who was lost and is finding his way. That is different from someone who is hiding."

Tenchi had been following this exchange with obvious confusion. "What are you talking about?"

"Adult things," Katsuhito said. "Boring things. Nothing you need to worry about."

"Everything is adult things." But Tenchi's complaint was mild, his attention already drifting to more interesting topics. "Tomorrow after school, remember. The kittens."

"We remember," Sheldon assured him. "I will be ready when you return from school."

"Good." Tenchi yawned, the long day catching up with him. "Because the kittens are important. Very important."

"All kittens are important."

"Exactly."

Later, on the engawa, Sheldon thought about the day's revelations.

The second sacred tree—smaller than the first but equally significant. Hope and memory, Tenchi had said, repeating words he did not understand. What could that mean? And why had the warmth responded to both trees, recognizing them as it recognized the great tree near the main hall?

The shrine held secrets. Layers beneath layers, histories that Katsuhito hinted at but did not explain. Sheldon was being permitted deeper access, step by step, but the full picture remained hidden.

Perhaps it would always remain hidden. Perhaps some mysteries were not meant to be solved, only lived with.

His grandmother would have understood that. She had been a woman of faith, comfortable with uncertainty, willing to accept that some questions had no answers. He had always wanted explanations, resolutions, neat conclusions to every puzzle. She had known that life was not like that—that sometimes you simply had to trust the process and let meaning emerge on its own schedule.

The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and eternal. The crickets sang their nightly songs. The warmth hummed quietly in his chest, present but not demanding.

Ten days. Nearly a week and a half in this new life.

Tomorrow he would watch the final stages of roof work. He would accompany Tenchi to see kittens—an errand that would probably strengthen the boy's campaign for a pet. He would continue learning the rhythms of this place, building the relationships that made a life.

And somewhere, in the back parts of the shrine, a tree stood that represented memory—whatever that meant, whatever secrets it held.

One mystery at a time. One day at a time. One step at a time.

The pattern was becoming clear now. The shape of his new life was emerging, like tiles being set on a roof—each one placed carefully, each one connected to those around it, the whole greater than the sum of its parts.

He sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Tomorrow would come soon enough.

Tonight, he rested in the knowledge that he was exactly where he needed to be.

## Day 11

---

## Thursday, April 13, 1989

---

Sheldon did not go to the house at dawn.

The decision was deliberate—Tanaka had said the finishing work today would be simpler, less instructive than the tile setting he had observed yesterday. And there were things to be done at the shrine, preparations for the kitten visit that Tenchi had been anticipating with barely contained excitement.

Instead, he woke at his new-normal time—early, but after sunrise—and joined the household for breakfast.

Tenchi was already dressed, his hair combed with unusual care, his school uniform neat and pressed. He sat at the table with the particular intensity of someone counting down to something important.

"Today is the day," he announced, as Sheldon entered.

"I am aware."

"After school. We go see the kittens. You promised."

"I did promise, and I will keep my promise."

"Good." Tenchi attacked his rice with enthusiasm. "I'm going to be the best student today so school goes faster. If I'm good, time moves quicker. That's what Grandpa says."

Katsuhito made a sound that might have been confirmation or might have been suppressed laughter. "I believe I said that being a good student makes time feel faster because you are engaged in the work. Not that good behavior alters the fundamental nature of time."

"Same thing," Tenchi said, with the certainty of a five-year-old who had found a truth and saw no reason to complicate it.

Breakfast continued in comfortable rhythm. Rice, miso soup, a small grilled fish, pickled vegetables. The same meal they had eaten most mornings, the repetition creating familiarity rather than boredom.

"What will you do today?" Katsuhito asked Sheldon.

"I thought I would visit the house to check on the finishing work. Then perhaps return here to help with whatever needs doing."

"The storage shed needs attention. I have been meaning to organize it for some time, but..." The old man shrugged. "Motivation has been lacking."

"I can help with that."

"Good. It is work better done with two people." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "And this afternoon, you will accompany Tenchi to see the kittens."

"I will."

"Be prepared. He has been working on his argument for why we should adopt one. I expect you will hear it multiple times during the visit."

Tenchi's expression suggested that yes, there was indeed an argument, and yes, it would be deployed with strategic precision.

---

The walk to school was bright and clear.

The weather had settled into the pattern of spring—warm days, cool nights, the occasional rain that swept through and left everything fresh and green. The cherry blossoms had peaked and were beginning to fall, their petals drifting down like pink snow, accumulating along the edges of paths and in the corners of courtyards.

Tenchi walked with unusual energy, his steps quick, his attention darting between the familiar sights of the route and whatever thoughts occupied his mind.

"Do you think the orange kitten will like me?" he asked, as they descended the three hundred steps.

"I think the kitten will need time to get to know you. Cats are independent creatures—they form opinions based on how people treat them."

"I would treat it very well. I would feed it and brush it and let it sleep on my bed—well, maybe not on my bed, Grandpa might not like that—but somewhere comfortable."

"Those are all good things."

"And I would play with it every day. Cats like to play. I've seen them chase things."

"They do enjoy chasing. It is an instinct from their hunting ancestors."

"Kabutaro doesn't chase things. He mostly just walks around his jar and eats leaves." Tenchi considered this. "Beetles are not very exciting. But I still love Kabutaro."

"Love is not dependent on excitement."

"I know. But a kitten would be exciting and lovable. That's better, right?"

Sheldon was not sure how to answer this without encouraging the campaign he was supposed to remain neutral in. "Different animals offer different kinds of companionship," he said carefully.

"That's what Grandpa says. But I want kitten companionship specifically."

They reached the bottom of the steps and walked through the village toward the bus stop. The morning was already active—shopkeepers opening their doors, farmers heading to fields, the ordinary bustle of a community waking up.

At the bus stop, Yamada-san was waiting with her son, who appeared to share Tenchi's enthusiasm for the day's events.

"Today is the kitten visit!" the boy announced. "Are you coming too?"

"Tsukino-san is taking me," Tenchi said, with evident pride. "We're going right after school."

"My mom is taking me. We're going to look at the grey one."

"The orange one is better."

"The grey one is better."

"The orange one—"

"They are both good kittens," Sheldon interrupted. "There is no need to compete."

The boys looked at him with the expression children reserved for adults who clearly did not understand important things. Then they continued their debate in lower tones, apparently having agreed to disagree on the matter of kitten superiority.

The bus arrived, swallowed the children, and departed. Sheldon watched it go, then turned toward the village.

---

The house was nearly complete.

Tanaka and his crew were doing the finishing work—cleaning tools, removing scaffolding, conducting final inspections. The roof looked whole again, its surface a continuous sweep of tiles that showed no obvious sign of repair.

"Tsukino-san." Tanaka greeted him with a brief nod. "You came to see the finished product."

"I wanted to watch the process to its end."

"The end is mostly cleaning. Not dramatic, but necessary." Tanaka gestured toward the roof. "We are satisfied with the work. The tiles are set properly, the underlayment is sound, the drainage patterns are correct. Barring unusual circumstances, this roof will protect the house for decades."

"That is reassuring to hear."

"Hashimoto will be your next call. The tatami cannot wait much longer—I noticed insect activity in one of the damaged mats. If left untreated, it will spread."

"I will contact him today."

They stood together for a moment, looking up at the completed work. The morning light played across the tiles, highlighting their curves, their interlocking patterns, the way they fit together into a unified whole.

"Thank you," Sheldon said. "For the work, and for allowing me to observe."

"Thank you for observing well. Most people do not take the time to understand what we do. They see only the result, not the process that creates it."

"The process seemed more important to learn than the result."

"Exactly." Tanaka's expression suggested approval. "You understand something that many never grasp. The result is temporary—roofs wear out, buildings decay, nothing lasts forever. But the process, the knowledge, the skill—these can be passed on. These can survive."

"Is that why you teach? To pass on what you know?"

"Partly. Also because I enjoy it." A slight smile. "There is satisfaction in watching someone learn. In seeing understanding dawn, in knowing that knowledge will continue after I am gone."

"I feel the same about scientific work. The papers I wrote—they will be read by others, built upon, extended. The work continues even when the worker stops."

"Yes. That is the consolation of craft. We are part of something larger than ourselves." Tanaka turned back to his crew. "Now, I must finish the mundane work of packing. Contact Hashimoto soon. Tell him I recommended him."

"I will. Thank you again, Tanaka-san."

---

The morning passed in productive work.

Sheldon returned to the shrine and joined Katsuhito in the storage shed—a small building near the main hall that had apparently been accumulating items for years. The contents were a mix of shrine implements, household goods, old tools, and things whose purpose had been forgotten.

"This has needed doing for some time," Katsuhito admitted, surveying the cluttered interior. "Every year I tell myself I will organize it. Every year something else takes priority."

"Where should we begin?"

"At the door and work inward. Everything must come out, be examined, and either return to a proper place or be discarded."

It was simple work, but satisfying—the gradual transformation of chaos into order. They removed items one by one, discussed their value, made decisions about keeping or discarding. Some things were obvious—broken tools, moth-eaten fabrics, containers with rusted-through bottoms. Others required more thought.

The shed was deeper than it appeared from outside, running back into the slope of the mountain. The further they went, the older the items became—things that had not been touched in decades, covered with dust and cobwebs, their original purposes sometimes unclear.

"What is this?" Sheldon asked, holding up a wooden frame strung with what appeared to be silk thread.

"A weaving device. For making rope from plant fibers." Katsuhito took it, examined it with careful hands. "My grandmother used this. She made all the shrine's ceremonial rope herself, from gathering the fibers to the final twisting. The skill died with her."

"Could the skill not be relearned?"

"Perhaps. If someone had the time and patience." He set the frame in the uncertain pile. "I have thought about it, over the years. But there is always something more pressing."

They found other remnants of forgotten skills: a set of wooden forms for making pottery, a collection of brushes for calligraphy, tools whose purposes neither could identify. Each represented knowledge that had been passed down for generations, then lost when the chain of transmission was broken.

"It is sad," Sheldon observed. "All this accumulated skill, all this knowledge, simply... gone."

"That is the nature of things. Knowledge survives only as long as there are people to carry it. When the carriers die without passing it on, the knowledge dies with them." Katsuhito's voice was philosophical rather than bitter. "We preserve what we can. We accept that we cannot preserve everything."

"Do you ever feel... guilty? About the things that have been lost?"

"Sometimes. But guilt is not useful. Better to focus on what can still be saved than to mourn what is already gone." He moved to the next shelf. "There is a story from the tea ceremony tradition. A master was asked what he would do if his prized tea bowl broke. He said he would sweep up the pieces carefully, honor them properly, and then find another bowl. The bowl is precious, but attachment to the bowl is a trap."

"That sounds like Buddhism."

"It is related. The Masaki have always practiced a... flexible form of spirituality. Shinto roots, but influences from many traditions." He lifted a dusty box and opened it. "Ah. I wondered where this had gone."

Inside was a set of calligraphy brushes, their handles lacquered in deep red, their bristles still supple despite the years. Beside them, wrapped in silk, was a small ink stone carved with an image of mountains.

"These were a gift from my wife's family," Katsuhito said. "For our wedding. I used them for years, then... set them aside. After she died."

"They are beautiful."

"She loved calligraphy. She would spend hours practicing, filling sheet after sheet with characters. The act of writing, she said, was a form of meditation—the brush becomes an extension of the mind, the ink a record of your thoughts in motion."

"Did she teach you?"

"She tried. I was not a patient student." A slight smile, touched with old sadness. "I wish now that I had been more attentive. Her art was beautiful. I have none of it left."

"Perhaps you could learn now. In her memory."

Katsuhito considered this. "Perhaps. The brushes are still good. The ink stone remains." He set the box aside, in the pile of things to keep. "Perhaps."

They continued working, the shed slowly emptying, its contents exposed to daylight for the first time in years.

"This was my wife's," Katsuhito said, holding a ceramic vase with a delicate blue pattern. His voice was careful, controlled. "She used it for flower arranging. After she died, I could not look at it. But I could not discard it either."

"Some things should be kept for reasons other than practical use."

"Yes." He set the vase aside, in the pile that would be retained. "Some things are worth keeping because they remind us of who we loved. Even when the reminder is painful."

"My grandmother kept a box of my grandfather's things. Letters he had written, his pocket watch, the tie he wore on their wedding day. She never opened it—she said that knowing it was there was enough."

"That is a form of preservation. Not just of objects, but of love itself."

They worked through the morning, the piles gradually sorting themselves—keep, discard, uncertain. The uncertain pile grew smaller as they discussed each item, finding reasons for decision one way or the other.

"This belonged to Tenchi's mother," Katsuhito said, holding up a small wooden box. "She kept her sewing supplies in it. Tenchi does not know I have it."

"Perhaps he should."

"Perhaps." The old man was quiet for a moment, his weathered hands gentle on the box. "I have tried to protect him from reminders. But perhaps that is wrong. Perhaps remembering is better than forgetting, even when remembering is painful."

"My grandmother said that grief was the price we paid for love. That the pain of remembering was also a form of connection—a way of keeping loved ones with us."

"Your grandmother was wise."

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"Because it is true." Katsuhito set the sewing box in the pile to keep. "I will give this to him soon. When the time is right."

By midday, the space was half cleared, and they paused for lunch with the satisfaction of progress made visible. The shed looked larger now, its dimensions revealed by the absence of clutter. And the things that remained—the things worth keeping—seemed somehow more significant for having been examined and chosen.

---

Tenchi arrived home like a small hurricane.

"Is it time? Can we go now? I changed out of my school clothes really fast—see?—I'm ready!"

He was indeed ready—wearing old clothes suitable for activity, his face flushed with anticipation, his whole body vibrating with impatience.

"We will leave shortly," Sheldon said. "First, you should eat something."

"I'm not hungry."

"You say that every day, and every day you are hungry an hour later."

"Today is different. Kittens take away hunger."

"That is not how biology works."

"It's how kitten biology works."

Despite his protests, Tenchi consumed a rice ball and several pickled vegetables with impressive speed. Then he stood by the door, practically bouncing on his feet.

"Now?"

"Now," Sheldon agreed.

They walked down the three hundred steps together, Tenchi chattering the entire way. His argument for kitten adoption had indeed been refined since the previous day—he now had specific points about companionship, pest control, shrine tradition, and the developmental benefits of pet ownership for children.

"I read about it in a book," he said. "Children who have pets are more responsible and more empathetic. Those are good things."

"Where did you find this book?"

"The school library. I asked Yamamoto-san for books about cats and she gave me one about pets in general." He looked up at Sheldon with an expression of innocent inquiry. "Did you know that pets can reduce stress? That seems important for Grandpa. He's old and stress is bad for old people."

"You are remarkably well-prepared."

"I want the kitten very much. Preparation is how you get things you want."

"Who told you that?"

"Grandpa. He says if you want something, you should work for it and be able to explain why you deserve it."

Sheldon had to admire the tactical sophistication. Tenchi had not only prepared arguments but had sourced them from the very authority he was trying to convince.

They reached the bottom of the steps and walked through the village. The afternoon was warm and pleasant, the kind of day that made you want to be outside doing exactly what they were doing—walking somewhere interesting with someone you cared about.

---

Yamamoto-san's house was on the eastern edge of the village, a modest building with a garden that suggested its owner had a talent for growing things. Flowers bloomed along the front path, vegetables grew in orderly rows along one side, and a small tree provided shade near the entrance.

Tenchi knocked on the door with an enthusiasm that probably could be heard throughout the house.

The woman who answered was middle-aged, with grey-streaked hair and a kind face that creased with smile lines when she saw Tenchi.

"Masaki-kun! You're here to see the kittens." She looked at Sheldon with polite curiosity. "And you must be Tsukino-san. Tenchi has told me about you."

"I hope the reports were favorable."

"Very favorable. He says you build forts and know about science and tell good stories." She stepped back from the door. "Please, come in. The kittens are in the back room."

The house was tidy and warm, with the particular feel of a home where a single person had lived for many years. A woman's touch was evident in the decorations—flowers in vases, carefully arranged cushions, photographs on a small shrine.

They were led to a back room where a large box had been set up with blankets and cushions. Inside, a calico mother cat lay on her side, watching them with the wary attention of a protective parent. Her eyes tracked their every movement, assessing, evaluating. And beside her, tumbling over each other with the uncoordinated enthusiasm of the very young, were four kittens.

Tenchi's breath caught.

"They're beautiful," he whispered.

The kittens were perhaps six weeks old—old enough to walk and play, still young enough to be comically uncoordinated. Their eyes were open, bright with curiosity, and they showed no fear of the visitors. One grey, one orange, two striped in patterns of brown and black.

The grey one was already climbing the side of the box, its tiny claws catching on the fabric. The orange one was wrestling with one of the striped siblings, both of them rolling in a tangle of paws and tails. The fourth kitten was investigating a bit of string that hung from the blanket.

"You can sit down here," Yamamoto-san said, gesturing to a spot near the box. "Let them come to you. They're friendly, but they'll approach when they're ready."

Tenchi sat immediately, his earlier energy transformed into perfect stillness. He watched the kittens with an intensity that suggested he was memorizing every detail, every movement, every tiny sound they made. His hands rested on his knees, open and waiting.

The mother cat observed for a moment, her tail twitching slightly. Then apparently deciding these visitors were acceptable, she closed her eyes and resumed her nap, trusting her children to the supervision of others.

Sheldon sat a few feet away, giving Tenchi space while maintaining proximity. The room smelled of clean animals and the particular warmth of a well-maintained home. Sunlight filtered through the window, creating patterns on the floor that the kittens occasionally chased.

One of the striped kittens was the first to investigate the visitors. It climbed over the edge of the box—a precarious journey that involved several failed attempts and a near-tumble—and made its way toward Tenchi with the wobbly steps of the not-quite-coordinated.

Tenchi held perfectly still, letting the kitten approach on its own terms.

It sniffed his knee, its tiny nose twitching. Then his hand, his sleeve, his face. The examination was thorough, methodical, surprisingly serious for such a small creature. Then, apparently satisfied, it climbed into his lap and curled up.

"Oh," Tenchi breathed. The single syllable contained multitudes—wonder, delight, a longing that seemed too large for such a small sound.

The grey kitten, having conquered the side of the box, now decided to investigate Sheldon. It crossed the floor with determination, pausing only to bat at a dust mote floating in a sunbeam, and began its own investigation of this larger, quieter human.

Sheldon remained still, allowing the examination. The kitten's whiskers tickled as it explored his hands, his wrists, the cuffs of his sleeves. Its paws were impossibly soft, its claws tiny pinpricks that caught on the fabric of his pants.

"They are curious," he observed.

"Very curious. They explore everything." Yamamoto-san was watching with the satisfied expression of someone whose hard work was being appreciated. "I have been socializing them since their eyes opened—handling them, letting them experience different sounds and textures. They should adapt well to new homes."

The orange kitten had disengaged from its wrestling match and was now approaching Tenchi from a different angle, apparently interested in what had captured the striped kitten's attention. It investigated the boy's other knee, then climbed up his side with determined effort, and finally settled in his lap alongside its sibling.

But whereas the striped kitten had simply curled up to sleep, the orange one sat upright, looking at Tenchi's face with what appeared to be genuine interest. It batted at his chin, at the collar of his shirt, at a strand of hair that had fallen across his forehead.

Tenchi laughed—a pure sound of delight—and carefully raised one hand to stroke the orange kitten's back. The kitten responded by arching into the touch, its small body vibrating with the beginning of a purr.

"They like you," Yamamoto-san said. "Cats can tell when someone genuinely cares about them. They respond to kindness."

"I would be very kind," Tenchi said, his voice hushed. "If I had a cat. I would be the kindest cat owner in the whole village."

"I believe you would."

---

The visit lasted over an hour.

All four kittens eventually made their way out of the box, exploring the room and its visitors with increasing confidence. The grey one proved to be the boldest, climbing everything in sight and showing no fear of heights. The striped ones stayed together, apparently more interested in wrestling with each other than in human attention. And the orange one...

The orange one had found Tenchi.

From the moment it had wobbled over to investigate him, the orange kitten had shown a clear preference. It sat in his lap, batted at his fingers when he wiggled them, and purred with a volume that seemed impossible from such a small body.

"I think it likes me," Tenchi said, his voice full of wonder.

"I think it does," Sheldon agreed.

He was sitting a few feet away, having become the chosen resting spot for the grey kitten, who had exhausted itself with climbing and was now sleeping on his knee. The warmth of the small body was unexpectedly pleasant, and he found himself reluctant to disturb it.

"The orange one is a male," Yamamoto-san said, returning with tea. "Healthy, friendly, good temperament. He would make a good pet for an active child."

Tenchi looked up at Sheldon with an expression that contained an entire campaign in a single glance.

"I cannot make this decision," Sheldon said carefully. "It is your grandfather's choice."

"But you could tell him what you observed. That the kitten is healthy and friendly and has a good temperament. Those are objective facts."

"They are."

"And objective facts are important in making good decisions."

"Also true."

"So you would be helping Grandpa make a good decision. By sharing objective facts."

Sheldon found himself outmaneuvered by a five-year-old. The logic was sound, even if the intent was transparent.

"I will share what I observed. I will not advocate for or against adoption."

"That's fair." Tenchi returned his attention to the orange kitten, who had fallen asleep in his lap. "That's completely fair."

But there was a small smile on his face that suggested he considered this a victory.

---

Other children arrived during the visit—Momoko with her mother, a boy named Kenji with his older sister. The room became crowded with young voices and kitten-related excitement.

Momoko was a serious girl about Tenchi's age, with short hair and a determined expression. She made straight for the grey kitten—apparently having already decided which one she wanted—and sat down to begin her own process of acquaintance.

"This one climbs a lot," she observed. "That means it's brave."

"Or foolish," her mother said mildly. "Those can look the same from a distance."

"Brave," Momoko insisted. "I like brave."

Kenji was younger, perhaps four, and more interested in the movement of the kittens than in holding them. He sat at the edge of the group, watching with wide eyes as the small creatures explored their expanded territory.

"They walk funny," he said. "Like they're drunk."

"They're still learning," his older sister explained. "Kittens are like babies. They have to learn how to do everything."

"Was I like that?"

"You were worse. You couldn't even walk until you were almost two."

"That's not true!"

"It's definitely true. Ask Mom."

The sibling argument continued in the background as Sheldon found himself talking with the adults. Yamamoto-san served tea, and the mothers shared observations about their children's enthusiasm.

"Momoko has wanted a cat for years," her mother said. "We finally agreed after her father found a medication that controls his allergies. He's been on it for a month now with no problems."

"That is good news for the family."

"Yes. Though I suspect the cat will cause its own problems. Scratched furniture, midnight yowling, the occasional dead bird left as a gift." She smiled wryly. "But children who grow up with pets learn things that children without pets don't. Responsibility, empathy, the reality of life and death."

Yamamoto-san nodded in agreement. "I have seen it countless times in my years of teaching. Children who have animals at home are often more mature, more aware of the needs of others. It is not a guarantee, of course—I have seen spoiled children with pets as well—but on average, the correlation is positive."

"Were you a teacher for many years?" Sheldon asked.

"Thirty-two years. Elementary school, mostly. I have seen many children grow up, start families, have children of their own who then became my students." She smiled, the lines of her face deepening with remembered affection. "The village is small enough that families repeat. I taught Tenchi's mother, you know. Kiyone was in my class for three years."

"What was she like? As a child?"

Yamamoto-san's expression softened further. "Quiet. Thoughtful. The kind of child who noticed everything and said little. She would sit in the back of the class and watch, taking it all in. Then she would ask questions that showed she understood more than anyone had expected."

"That sounds like Tenchi."

"Yes. He has her eyes—not just the color, but the way they observe. He sees more than most children his age." She paused, considering her words. "When Kiyone became sick, I visited her several times. She spoke about Tenchi with such love, such worry. She was not afraid to die—she was afraid to leave him without a mother."

"I did not realize you were close."

"We were not, particularly—I was her teacher years ago, and the relationship had become one of casual village acquaintance. But she sought me out, toward the end. She wanted to talk about Tenchi, about what kind of person he was becoming, about what he would need."

"What did she say?"

Yamamoto-san was quiet for a moment, her gaze moving to where Tenchi sat with the orange kitten still purring in his lap.

"She said he was a child who felt things deeply but showed little on the surface. She said he needed people who would see past the calm exterior to the intensity beneath. She said—" Her voice caught slightly. "She said she hoped he would find people who loved him not just for what he did, but for who he was."

The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning.

"I cannot keep them all," Yamamoto-san said, returning to the practical present. "One cat is company. Five cats is a problem."

"Have you found homes for them?"

"Two, definitely—Momoko's family and the Tanaka boy. The striped ones. I think Tenchi would like the orange one, but I know Masaki-san is uncertain about pets."

"He has concerns about responsibility and commitment."

"Understandable. Pets are work. But..." She glanced again at Tenchi, who was gently stroking the sleeping kitten with a concentration that suggested nothing else in the world existed. "Some children need something to care for. It teaches them about love in a way nothing else can."

"You were a teacher for many years?"

"Thirty-two years. I have seen many children, many families. I have learned to recognize when a child needs something." She paused. "Tenchi lost his mother very young. He needs... anchors. Things that are his, that depend on him, that give him purpose beyond himself."

It was an observation that resonated with what Sheldon had come to understand about the boy.

"I will mention your thoughts to Masaki-san," he said. "But the decision remains his."

"Of course. I would not presume." But her expression suggested she had said exactly what she intended to say, to exactly the person who needed to hear it.

---

The walk home was quiet at first.

Tenchi was subdued, his earlier excitement transformed into something more contemplative. He walked beside Sheldon in silence, his thoughts clearly elsewhere—back in Yamamoto-san's house, perhaps, with the small orange creature that had claimed him so completely.

The evening light was soft and golden, the kind that made everything look slightly magical. The village seemed peaceful, the bustle of the day winding down, families gathering for dinner, the smell of cooking beginning to drift from open windows.

"The kitten was warm," Tenchi said finally. "When it slept on me. I could feel it breathing. Its little sides going in and out."

"That is one of the pleasures of pets. The physical presence of another living thing."

"It purred right into my chest. I could feel it in my bones." Tenchi was quiet for a moment. "I didn't want to leave. I wanted to stay there forever, with the kitten purring on me."

"Some moments are like that. They feel so perfect that you want to hold onto them."

"Mom used to let me lie on her when I was tired. I would put my head on her chest and hear her heartbeat. Thump-thump, thump-thump." His voice was matter-of-fact, but there was depth beneath it. "I miss that. Having something warm that breathes."

The words hit Sheldon with unexpected force. Such a simple thing—the sound of a heartbeat, the warmth of another body. The things we took for granted until they were gone.

"Grandpa is warm," Tenchi continued. "But he doesn't like me lying on him. He says I'm too heavy and his bones are old." A small shrug. "I understand. Old people have different bones."

"That is true."

"But a kitten is small. And kittens like to be held. The orange one liked it when I petted its back. It pushed right into my hand." Tenchi mimed the motion with his own hand. "Like it was saying 'more please.'"

They walked in companionable silence for a while, climbing the first section of the three hundred steps. The effort required concentration, breaking the flow of conversation.

"Tsukino-san?" Tenchi said, when they paused to rest.

"Yes?"

"Do you ever miss things? From before you came here?"

The question was asked with genuine curiosity, not suspicion. Tenchi had accepted Sheldon's presence without demanding explanations, but he was clearly aware that there was a "before."

"Yes," Sheldon said. "I miss my grandmother most of all. She died before I came here, but I still miss her."

"What was she like?"

"She was kind. Patient. She knew how to make anything grow—plants, but also people. She made you feel like you could do things, just by believing in you."

"That sounds nice."

"It was. I did not appreciate it enough at the time." Sheldon looked out over the village below, the familiar view becoming more familiar each time he saw it. "That is one of the hard lessons of life. We often do not appreciate things until they are gone."

"I appreciated Mom," Tenchi said quietly. "Even before she got sick. I knew she was special."

"That is a gift. Many children do not know that until much later."

"She told me. She said, 'Tenchi, remember that I love you. Whatever happens, remember that.' So I remember." His voice was steady, without self-pity. "Every day I remember."

Sheldon felt the weight of those words—the burden a dying mother had placed on her five-year-old son, and the faithfulness with which he carried it.

"Your grandfather has not decided yet," he said carefully, returning to the original subject. "But I will tell him what I observed. The kitten does seem well-suited to you."

"Thank you." Tenchi's hand found his as they continued climbing. "Even if he says no, thank you for bringing me. For letting me hold it."

"You are welcome."

"And thank you for telling me about your grandmother. It helps to know that other people miss people too."

"We all do. It is one of the things that connects us."

They climbed the remaining steps together, the evening light softening toward dusk, the first stars appearing in the darkening sky. By the time they reached the top, the familiar sounds of the shrine surrounded them—wind in the great tree, crickets beginning their evening chorus, the distant call of a bird settling for the night.

Katsuhito met them at the door, his expression suggesting he knew exactly what had transpired and was bracing himself for the aftermath.

"How were the kittens?"

"Very nice," Tenchi said, his voice carefully controlled. "The orange one was my favorite. It sat on my lap for a long time and purred."

"I see."

"I am not asking for anything right now. I am just sharing what happened. Like Tsukino-san shares objective observations."

Katsuhito looked at Sheldon with an expression that suggested he knew exactly whose influence was at work here.

"Dinner is almost ready," the old man said. "We can discuss observations later."

---

Dinner was fish and vegetables, prepared with Katsuhito's usual skill.

The conversation flowed around the kitten visit—Sheldon's observations of the animals, Yamamoto-san's history as a teacher, the other children who had come to see the litter. Tenchi contributed occasionally but mostly listened, his earlier campaign apparently on hold.

After dinner, during the cleanup, Katsuhito spoke quietly.

"The boy has grown attached."

"He has."

"Was the kitten truly well-suited to him?"

Sheldon considered the question. "From what I observed, yes. The orange kitten showed an immediate preference for Tenchi and remained calm and content in his presence. Their temperaments appeared compatible."

"Yamamoto-san raised good animals. Her recommendations can be trusted."

"She mentioned that Tenchi might benefit from having something that depends on him. Something to care for."

Katsuhito was silent for a moment. "She said this to you?"

"She did."

"Hmm." The old man finished drying a bowl, set it aside. "She was always perceptive. Thirty years of teaching children—one learns to see what is beneath the surface."

"What are you thinking?"

"I am thinking that I have resisted this for practical reasons—the responsibility, the disruption to routine, the work involved. But perhaps I have been considering the wrong factors."

"What factors should be considered?"

"Whether the benefit to Tenchi outweighs the inconvenience to me." Katsuhito's voice was quiet, reflective. "He has lost much. His mother, his father in all practical senses, his childhood certainties. I have tried to provide stability, structure, care. But I cannot replace everything he has lost."

"No one can."

"No. But perhaps a small creature that loves him unconditionally... perhaps that offers something I cannot."

Sheldon let the silence stretch, sensing that Katsuhito was working through something important.

"I will speak with Yamamoto-san tomorrow," the old man said finally. "I will not promise anything to Tenchi until I am certain. But I will explore the possibility."

"He will be pleased."

"He will be unbearable with excitement." But there was affection beneath the complaint. "I suppose I have only myself to blame. I raised him to argue his case and seek what he wants. I cannot be surprised when he does exactly that."

---

Bath time and bedtime followed the usual pattern.

Tenchi was quieter than normal, his mind still clearly on the kitten he had held. He submitted to bath time without protest, brushed his teeth without reminder, and settled into his futon with Usagi-chan clutched to his chest.

"Tsukino-san?"

"Yes?"

"Do you think Grandpa will say yes?"

"I do not know. But I know he is thinking about it carefully."

"That's good, right? If he was going to say no, he would just say no. Thinking means maybe."

"Thinking means he is considering all factors. It means he respects the decision enough to give it proper attention."

"I hope he says yes." Tenchi's voice was small, honest. "Not because I want a pet—I mean, I do want a pet—but because... because the kitten felt right. Like it was supposed to be with me."

"Sometimes things feel that way. Sometimes those feelings are correct."

"Is that how you felt? When you came here?"

The question was unexpected but not unwelcome. "Yes," Sheldon said. "This place felt right, even when I did not understand why. I chose to trust that feeling."

"And was it correct?"

"So far, yes. I believe it was."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this answer. His eyes were heavy, the long day catching up with him.

"Goodnight, Tsukino-san."

"Goodnight, Tenchi."

The boy was asleep within minutes, his breathing evening out, his small body relaxing into rest. Sheldon sat with him for a while, as he had begun to do each night, feeling the weight of his responsibility and the warmth of his affection.

---

Later, on the engawa, Sheldon and Katsuhito sat together in the darkness.

The stars were brilliant tonight, the Milky Way a river of light across the sky. The great tree stood as a dark silhouette against the starfield, its presence constant and reassuring.

"Eleven days," Katsuhito said quietly. "You have been here eleven days."

"It feels longer."

"Does it? In a good way or a bad way?"

"In a good way. Time expands when it is full of meaning."

"Yes. Empty days pass quickly. Full days pass slowly and are remembered well."

They sat in comfortable silence, the night sounds washing over them—crickets and frogs and the occasional call of an owl in the distance.

"I have decided," Katsuhito said. "About the kitten."

"Yes?"

"I will allow it. With conditions—Tenchi must be responsible for feeding and basic care. The litter box stays in the mudroom. The cat does not sleep in his bedroom until it is properly trained."

"He will agree to any conditions."

"I know. That is partly why I am agreeing." A pause. "The other reason is that Yamamoto-san is right. He needs something to love that loves him back. Something small and warm and present. I have tried to be enough, but I am old and busy and not particularly affectionate in the ways children need."

"You are plenty affectionate."

"In my way, perhaps. But my way is not everyone's way." Katsuhito turned to look at Sheldon in the darkness. "You have helped with that, you know. Your presence has given him something I could not provide."

"I have done nothing extraordinary."

"You have been present. You have been consistent. You have paid attention to him when he needed attention and given him space when he needed space. That is not nothing—that is everything."

"It is what anyone would do."

"It is what a good parent would do. Not everyone is capable of it." The old man's voice carried something that might have been gratitude. "I was not sure, when you arrived, what you would become. Now I am less uncertain."

"What have I become?"

"Part of this family. Part of this place. Part of whatever future we are building together."

The words settled around them, heavy with meaning. Sheldon found he did not know how to respond, so he simply sat, accepting what had been said.

"Thank you," he managed finally.

"Do not thank me. Simply continue as you have begun."

The stars wheeled overhead. The crickets sang. The warmth in Sheldon's chest hummed quietly, acknowledging something—progress, perhaps, or promise, or simply the reality of belonging.

Eleven days. And a kitten on the way.

The life he was building was becoming more complex, more connected, more real. Each addition brought new responsibilities and new joys. Each day wove new threads into the pattern of his existence here.

Tomorrow he would tell Tenchi the news. Would watch the boy's face transform with joy. Would help prepare for the arrival of a small orange creature that would become part of their household, part of their lives.

One more thread. One more connection. One more reason to stay.

⁂

## Day 12

---

## Friday, April 14, 1989

---

The morning began with a secret.

Sheldon woke to find Katsuhito already in the kitchen, but instead of the usual quiet efficiency of breakfast preparation, the old man was standing by the window, looking out at the pre-dawn grey with an expression of contemplation.

"You are awake early," Sheldon said.

"I did not sleep well. Too many thoughts." Katsuhito turned from the window. "I will speak with Yamamoto-san this morning. To confirm the arrangement."

"About the kitten."

"Yes. I want it settled before I tell Tenchi. He has been remarkably restrained since your visit yesterday—I suspect he is afraid that asking will somehow jinx the outcome." A slight smile. "Children have their own magical thinking."

"When will you tell him?"

"After school, I think. Let him have a normal day first. The excitement will make homework impossible, so better to wait until the day's obligations are complete."

"That is thoughtful."

"It is strategic. I have learned that managing information is as important as managing behavior." Katsuhito moved toward the stove. "Breakfast first. Then I will go to the village while you handle the shrine's morning work."

They prepared the meal together in comfortable silence, the routine now so familiar that words were unnecessary. Rice, miso soup, a small fish, pickled vegetables. The same meal as always, its repetition creating structure rather than boredom.

Tenchi appeared on schedule, slightly bleary-eyed but dressed and ready for school. He did not mention kittens—a restraint that was clearly costing him—and ate his breakfast with determined focus on anything else.

"Yamamoto-san's garden looks nice this year," he offered, apropos of nothing.

"Does it?" Katsuhito's expression was carefully neutral.

"Yes. Very nice. Lots of flowers." A pause. "And other things."

"Other things?"

"Garden things. Nothing in particular."

Sheldon hid a smile behind his tea cup. The boy's attempt at nonchalance was charming in its transparency.

---

After Tenchi left for school, Katsuhito prepared to descend to the village.

"The morning work is straightforward," he said. "Sweep the main courtyard, check the water levels in the stone basins, ensure the lanterns are properly cleaned. Nothing complex."

"I understand."

"I may be gone for some time. Yamamoto-san will want to discuss care instructions, and there are other errands I should complete while I am in the village." He paused at the door. "If you finish early, you might check on the house. Tanaka-san said the final inspection would be today."

"I will do that."

Katsuhito departed, his steps on the stone path fading into the morning sounds of birds and wind. Sheldon stood alone in the kitchen for a moment, absorbing the quiet, then went to begin his work.

---

The shrine in early morning light had its own particular beauty.

The sun was just cresting the mountains to the east, sending long rays across the courtyard, illuminating the torii gate with golden fire. Dew sparkled on every surface—the stone lanterns, the leaves of the great tree, the moss that grew along the edges of the paths. The world seemed freshly made, washed clean by the night, ready to begin again.

Sheldon swept slowly, methodically, letting the rhythm of the work settle his mind. The broom made soft sounds against the stone, gathering the night's accumulation of leaves and debris. Small birds hopped along the edges of the courtyard, apparently accustomed to this routine, waiting for insects to be disturbed by his passage.

He had learned the proper technique from Katsuhito—not just pushing the broom but using it to lift and carry, guiding the debris toward designated collection points rather than simply scattering it. There was an efficiency to the method that he had not appreciated at first, but now found deeply satisfying. Every motion had purpose; nothing was wasted.

The great tree stood as always, massive and patient, its presence a constant in the changing light of day. The warmth in Sheldon's chest stirred slightly as he passed near it—the usual acknowledgment, the quiet recognition between whatever he carried and whatever the tree held.

"Good morning," he said quietly, feeling only slightly foolish for greeting a tree.

The tree did not respond, of course. But there was something that might have been acknowledgment—a slight settling, a sense of attention—or perhaps it was only his imagination. He had learned not to dismiss such feelings here, where the boundary between the ordinary and the extraordinary seemed thinner than he had once believed.

The cherry blossoms were nearly finished now, he noticed. The pink petals that had covered the ground a week ago had mostly blown away, replaced by the new green leaves of late spring. The cycle was completing itself—bloom, fall, renewal. In another week, the trees would be fully green, the memory of blossoms preserved only in photographs and the minds of those who had seen them.

His grandmother had loved spring. "Everything coming back to life," she would say, standing in her garden, watching the first shoots push through the soil. "It's proof that death isn't the end. Just a pause, a rest, before the next beginning."

He had dismissed this as sentimentality then. Now, sweeping a courtyard in Japan while carrying some inexplicable warmth in his chest, he was less certain. Perhaps death was not the end. Perhaps he was himself proof of that possibility.

He completed the sweeping, then moved to check the water basins. These were small stone structures placed at intervals around the courtyard, holding water for visitors to purify their hands before approaching the shrine. Each needed to be kept clean and full, the water changed regularly to prevent stagnation.

Today, one of the basins had a frog.

It sat on the edge of the stone, watching Sheldon with the imperturbable calm of a creature that knew it belonged here. Its skin was green and glossy, its throat pulsing slightly with each breath.

"I need to change the water," Sheldon told it.

The frog blinked.

"I will not harm you. I simply need you to move."

Another blink. The frog showed no intention of moving.

Sheldon sighed and began the process of carefully draining and refilling the basin while working around his small green observer. The frog watched with apparent interest, occasionally shifting position but never leaving its perch.

"You are stubborn," Sheldon observed.

The frog croaked once—a sound that might have been agreement—and settled more firmly onto the stone.

When the basin was refilled with fresh water, the frog finally moved—not away, but into the water, settling onto a small rock near the bottom with the air of a creature that had achieved its objective all along.

"You planned this," Sheldon accused.

The frog did not deign to respond.

He finished the morning work—cleaning lanterns, checking offerings, ensuring everything was in proper order for any visitors who might come. The shrine rarely received visitors on ordinary weekdays, but Katsuhito maintained standards regardless. "We do not serve the visitors," he had explained. "We serve the shrine. The visitors simply benefit."

It was a philosophy that resonated with Sheldon's scientific training. You did not do good work for recognition or reward; you did it because good work mattered in itself. The external validation was secondary to the internal satisfaction of excellence.

---

The shrine work was complete by mid-morning.

Sheldon had cleaned the lanterns, checked the offerings, swept the paths that led from the main courtyard toward the back of the shrine. The routine was becoming automatic now, his hands knowing what to do without his mind needing to direct them.

He took a moment to sit on the engawa and simply be present. The morning was warming, the air carrying the particular sweetness of spring. Insects hummed in the garden areas, and somewhere in the forest, a woodpecker was methodically investigating a tree.

His grandmother would have loved this, he thought. The peace of it, the rhythm of meaningful work, the connection to something larger than oneself. She had found such contentment in her own routines—the daily tending of garden and house, the weekly visits to church, the seasonal rituals that marked the passing of time.

He had not understood then. Had seen her life as small, limited, lacking the grandeur of scientific discovery or academic achievement. Now he recognized it as something else entirely—a life built on care rather than ambition, on presence rather than striving, on the quiet satisfaction of things done well.

Could he build such a life here? Could he learn to find the contentment that had eluded him for forty-three years?

The warmth in his chest hummed gently, as though offering encouragement. Perhaps that was the answer—not a definitive yes or no, but a patient willingness to try.

---

The walk down to the village was pleasant in the late morning light.

The three hundred steps had become familiar now, his feet finding the worn stones without conscious thought. His body had adapted to the daily climbs—the burning in his legs that had marked his first days had faded to a comfortable awareness, muscles strengthened by repetition.

The village was active with its usual midday business. Shopkeepers arranged their wares, housewives carried baskets from the market, children too young for school played in the small park near the community center. Several people nodded to Sheldon as he passed—recognition that no longer carried surprise.

He found Tanaka at the house, as Katsuhito had suggested.

The roofer was conducting his final inspection, walking the perimeter of the building, examining the completed work with critical attention. His crew was absent—the finishing work apparently a solitary responsibility. Tanaka moved with the unhurried deliberation of someone who had done this countless times before, each step precise, each pause purposeful.

"Tsukino-san." Tanaka greeted him without looking away from the roofline. "You came to see the completion."

"I wanted to witness the end, as I witnessed much of the process."

"Good. Closure matters. A project begun is half a project; a project completed is whole." Tanaka pointed toward a section of the roof. "Come. I will show you what to look for in future inspections. This knowledge will serve you for the life of the house."

They walked the perimeter together, Tanaka explaining the signs of proper work and the warning signs of developing problems. The alignment of tiles—each should sit level with its neighbors, with no visible gaps beyond the expected overlap pattern. The condition of flashing around chimneys and vents—the metal should lie flat, sealed, showing no corrosion or lifting. The drainage patterns that channeled water toward the eaves rather than allowing it to pool.

"See here," Tanaka said, pointing to a valley where two roof sections met. "This is where water collects during rain. If the work is poor, this is where problems will appear first. Note how the tiles are cut at precise angles, how the valley is lined beneath."

Sheldon examined the area, noting the careful craftsmanship that was invisible from casual observation.

"You should inspect twice a year," Tanaka continued. "Spring and autumn, after the heavy seasons. Look for shifted tiles, accumulated debris, any discoloration that might indicate water penetration. Walk slowly. Pay attention. Most problems are visible from the ground if you know what to look for."

"I will remember."

"And if you see problems developing, address them immediately. Small problems become large problems quickly. A single cracked tile, ignored, can lead to thousands of yen in repairs. Water is patient—it will find a way in, given time."

"The same is true of most things in life."

Tanaka paused, considering this. "Yes. That is true. The wisdom applies broadly. Small neglects accumulate into large failures. In roofing, in relationships, in all things." He completed his circuit and stopped near the front entrance. "The roof is sound. It will protect this house for many years, if properly maintained."

"That is reassuring to hear."

"The house itself is sound. Hideo-san built well—I can see his craft in every joint, every beam. What has failed was neglect, not construction." Tanaka's voice carried respect for the absent craftsman. "He knew what he was doing."

"Thank you, Tanaka-san. For the work and for the teaching."

"Thank you for being worth teaching." The roofer produced a small envelope from his jacket. "The final invoice. The amount we agreed upon, plus the materials costs that were discussed."

Sheldon accepted the envelope, noting that it was sealed with the understated elegance of traditional Japanese business correspondence—heavy paper, precise folds, hand-brushed characters. "I will arrange payment this afternoon."

"There is no rush. I trust you."

The simple statement carried more weight than its words. Trust, in this community, was not easily given. Sheldon had earned something in these days of watching and learning—something more valuable than roofing knowledge.

"I have tools," he said, remembering the conversation from earlier in the week. "Hideo-san's tools. You said you might look at them?"

"I remember. Bring them sometime—not today, I have other appointments—but soon. I am curious to see what Hideo-san's father created. The tools of that generation were remarkable—made by craftsmen for craftsmen."

"I will. Thank you again."

Tanaka departed with a brief bow, leaving Sheldon alone with the house.

---

The building looked different now.

With the roof complete, the whole structure seemed more substantial—less a neglected remnant and more a building with potential. The windows still needed attention, their frames weathered, their glass clouded with years of accumulated grime. The walls still required replastering where moisture had damaged the surface. The interior remained unfinished, a canvas waiting for work. But the foundation of restoration was laid. The house could be saved.

Sheldon walked through the empty rooms, his footsteps echoing on the bare floors. The light filtered through dirty windows, creating patterns of dust motes that swirled with his passage. Each room held possibilities—he was beginning to see them now, after nearly two weeks of imagining.

The main room would be the living area, its proportions generous by Japanese standards. The tatami, once replaced, would create a comfortable space for sitting, reading, receiving guests. The tokonoma alcove in the corner could hold a simple scroll and a flower arrangement, as tradition dictated.

The adjacent room would serve as a sleeping area, or perhaps a study. It was smaller but equally well-proportioned, with good light from a window that faced the morning sun. He could imagine a desk there, shelves of books, a space for quiet work.

The kitchen remained functional in its bones, despite years of neglect. The sink was solid stone, stained but not damaged. The cooking area needed new flooring and fresh surfaces, but the ventilation system—a series of carefully positioned windows and a chimney—showed the thoughtfulness of its original design.

He climbed to the upper floor, where the damaged tatami had been removed. The floor beneath was sound—Tanaka's crew had confirmed this—with only a small area of water damage that would need attention before new tatami could be laid.

This floor could become the workshop. The light was excellent, streaming through large windows that Hideo had apparently installed for exactly this purpose. There was space for a workbench, for tool storage, for the kind of detailed repair work that required good visibility and room to spread out.

He found himself standing where Hideo must have stood, looking out the same windows at the same view of the village below. The old craftsman had built this space for himself, had worked here for decades before age and grief took his capacity for work. The tools in their cloth wrappings, the photographs on the walls downstairs, the careful construction of every surface—all of it spoke of a man who had loved his work and loved his space.

"I will try to be worthy of what you built," Sheldon said quietly.

The house did not answer. But there was something—a sense of acceptance, perhaps, or simply the settling of old wood in the afternoon warmth. He chose to take it as welcome.

Hashimoto would be the next step. Then perhaps the plumber, the electrician, the plasterer. Layer by layer, the house would be rebuilt. Month by month, it would become a home.

His grandmother's voice echoed in his memory: "A house is just walls and a roof. A home is what you build inside."

He would build something here. Something worth living in, worth caring for. Something that would stand long after he was gone.

---

The afternoon brought the moment Tenchi had been waiting for.

Sheldon was back at the shrine when the bus arrived, depositing Tenchi at the bottom of the three hundred steps. The boy climbed with his usual energy, dropping his school bag at the entrance and looking around with barely concealed hope.

"Where is Grandpa?"

"He went to the village this morning. He should return soon."

"Did he... did he say anything? About anything?"

"He said many things. Could you be more specific?"

Tenchi's expression suggested that Sheldon was being deliberately obtuse, which was perhaps not entirely inaccurate.

"About... garden things. Or things that might live in gardens. Or near gardens."

"He did not mention gardens specifically."

"Oh." The boy's face fell slightly, hope warring with disappointment. "That's okay. I wasn't expecting anything. I was just wondering."

"Perhaps you should change out of your school clothes. And perhaps have a snack. Your grandfather will return when he returns."

Tenchi complied with unusual meekness, his earlier restraint apparently exhausted by a full day of not asking about kittens. He changed, ate a rice ball, and then sat in the main room, pretending to read a book while actually watching the door with fierce attention.

Katsuhito returned an hour later, carrying a basket that clinked with what sounded like supplies.

Tenchi leaped to his feet. "Grandpa! You're back!"

"I am." The old man set down his basket with deliberate slowness, taking his time, drawing out the moment with the careful timing of someone who understood drama. "I had errands in the village. Many errands. Very time-consuming."

"Did you... talk to anyone? While you were doing errands?"

"I talked to many people. Ito-san at the grocery—she says the strawberries will be good this year. Nakamura-san on the street—his hip is bothering him again. Yamamoto-san at her house."

Tenchi went very still. His whole body seemed to freeze mid-breath. "Yamamoto-san?"

"Yes. We had a long conversation." Katsuhito began unpacking the basket, taking items out one by one and placing them on the table with agonizing precision. Rice crackers. A bundle of vegetables. A small bag of what looked like dried fish. Each item set down with the deliberation of a man who had nowhere else to be.

"What... what did you talk about?"

"Various things. Her garden, which is indeed quite nice this year—she has a new variety of hydrangea that is particularly impressive. The weather, which has been pleasant. The health of her mother cat, who is doing well after the birth."

Tenchi's hands were clenched at his sides. His breathing had become audible.

"And," Katsuhito continued, his expression perfectly neutral, "we discussed the care and feeding of certain small animals."

A sound escaped Tenchi—half breath, half hope.

"Specifically," the old man said, setting down a final item—a bag from the pet supply section of some store, clearly visible through the plastic—"we discussed the specifics of adopting a kitten."

The sound Tenchi made was not entirely human. It was joy and disbelief and overwhelming emotion compressed into a single syllable that might have been "really?" but emerged as something closer to a squeak.

"The orange one," Katsuhito confirmed, and his neutral expression cracked slightly, warmth bleeding through. "Yamamoto-san says he has shown a clear preference for you, and she believes you would be a good match. I am inclined to agree."

Tenchi stood frozen for a moment, as though the news was too large to process. Then his face crumpled—not with sadness, but with the overwhelm of a hope fulfilled, a wish granted after so much careful restraint.

"Really?" His voice was very small now. "Really, really?"

"Really, really. There are conditions, of course. Responsibilities. We will discuss them before the kitten arrives."

"Yes! Anything! Any conditions!" The freeze broke, and Tenchi was bouncing on his feet, unable to contain his energy. Tears were streaming down his face even as he grinned. "When? When does he come? When can I see him again?"

"Yamamoto-san suggests next week, once the kitten is fully weaned and she has completed the initial veterinary checks. Perhaps Wednesday or Thursday."

"A whole week?" The wait seemed to cause physical pain. "That's forever!"

"It is five or six days. You will survive. I have every confidence in your resilience."

Tenchi launched himself at his grandfather, wrapping his arms around the old man's waist with fierce intensity. "Thank you thank you thank you thank you—"

Katsuhito's hand came to rest on the boy's head, gentle despite the gruff words. "Thank me by being responsible. Feed him on schedule, clean the litter box daily, play with him so he gets exercise. A pet is a commitment, not a toy. He is a living creature who will depend on you."

"I will. I promise. I'll be the best cat owner in the whole world. The whole universe."

"The whole universe seems ambitious. Let us start with the village and work outward." But there was softness in the old man's voice, affection that he usually kept better hidden. "I believe you will try your best. That is all anyone can ask."

Sheldon watched the exchange from a few feet away, feeling the warmth of the moment wash over him. Tenchi's joy was so pure, so uncomplicated—the happiness of a child receiving something precious, something wanted and waited for. It was a privilege to witness.

---

The evening was filled with plans.

Tenchi wanted to discuss names (Orange Marmalade? Mikan? Just Orange? Something completely different?), sleeping arrangements (surely a kitten could sleep in his room if properly trained? what about just on weekends?), and every other aspect of cat ownership that he had apparently been researching for months.

The naming discussion proved particularly complex.

"Marmalade is good because of Tsukino-san's grandmother's cat," Tenchi reasoned, counting arguments on his fingers. "It's a tradition. But Mikan is also good because it's Japanese for orange and we're in Japan. But Orange is simple and clear. But maybe something completely different?"

"What would be completely different?" Katsuhito asked, with the patience of someone who had raised children before.

"I don't know. That's why it's completely different. Like... Taro? Or Kenta? Or... Mochi?"

"Mochi is white."

"Mochi can have flavors! Orange mochi exists!"

"This is true. Orange mochi does exist."

"What about Hinata? That means sunny place. And he's orange like the sun."

"That is a thoughtful connection."

"Or Sora? That means sky. Because his eyes are kind of sky-colored?"

"I believe his eyes are more green than blue."

"Okay, not Sora. What about..." Tenchi trailed off, clearly running through his mental catalog of possibilities. "This is hard. Names are important. Yamamoto-san said the name shapes the cat."

"Did she?"

"She said names matter. That's basically the same thing."

Katsuhito fielded the questions with patient amusement, occasionally redirecting the more ambitious proposals and affirming the reasonable ones. The pet supply bag contained the basics—a litter box, food bowls, a small bag of kitten food—but more would be needed.

"We will go to Kurashiki this weekend," Katsuhito said. "There is a proper pet store there. You can select a collar and a toy."

"A toy! What kind of toy do cats like?"

"Things they can chase. Things with feathers or bells. String that dangles. Yamamoto-san will have recommendations—she has experience with what excites young cats."

"I want to get the best toy. The one he'll love the most."

"You may find that he loves a crumpled paper ball more than any purchased toy. Cats are unpredictable in their preferences."

"Really?"

"Really. Your mother's cat Shinji was the same. We bought him elaborate toys from the city, and his favorite thing was a bottle cap that had fallen behind the stove. He played with it for years."

Tenchi's eyes lit up at the mention of his mother's cat. "Tell me more about Shinji. What else did he like?"

"He liked sleeping in sunbeams. He liked sitting on the engawa and watching birds. He was suspicious of strangers but warm with family. He would wait at the door when your mother came home from school and follow her to her room."

"Did he love her?"

"In the way cats love, yes. He was devoted to her. When she left for university in Osaka, he waited at her door for months, checking each evening to see if she had returned."

"That's sad."

"It is also beautiful. To be loved that completely, by any creature—that is a gift."

Tenchi absorbed this, his excitement tempered by the weight of the story. "I hope my kitten loves me like that."

"If you are kind to him and consistent in your care, he will. Love follows attention. It is true of cats and of people."

Sheldon watched the exchange with quiet pleasure. The joy in Tenchi's face was infectious—pure and uncomplicated in a way that adult happiness rarely managed to be. Whatever complications the kitten might bring, this moment made them worthwhile.

"Tsukino-san!" Tenchi turned to include him. "What should I name him? You said your grandmother's cat was Marmalade, and the kitten is orange like marmalade, so maybe that name? But it's also Japanese marmalade, so maybe Mikan? Or something completely different?"

"The name should feel right to you. You will be saying it many times, calling him to meals, calling him in from outside. It should fit comfortable in your mouth."

"That's not helpful."

"It is the truest help I can offer. Names are personal. They should come from the one who will use them."

Tenchi considered this with more seriousness than a five-year-old usually brought to naming decisions. "I need to think about it. I need to really know him first. Then the right name will come."

"That is a wise approach."

"Grandpa, did you name Mom's cat? When she was little?"

Katsuhito blinked, apparently caught off guard by the question. "Kiyone named her own cat. She called him Shinji, after a character in a book she loved—a samurai who was loyal to his lord even when loyalty required great sacrifice."

"What happened to Shinji? At the end?"

"He lived a long life. He died the year before you were born, in his sleep, at a great age for a cat." The old man's voice softened. "Your mother cried for a week. She had had him since she was your age—they grew up together."

"That's sad."

"It is also beautiful. To love something enough that losing it causes pain—that is a gift, not a burden. The pain is the price of the love, and the love is worth the price."

Tenchi absorbed this in silence, his excitement dampened but not extinguished. "I will love my kitten that much too. Even knowing it will be sad later."

"That is all any of us can do. Love fully, knowing that loss is inevitable. It is the human condition. It is also the human privilege."

The wisdom seemed too large for the conversation, but Tenchi accepted it with the flexibility of childhood, filing it away for future processing. Then his excitement resurged: "Can we set up the litter box tonight? So it's ready?"

"The litter box can wait until closer to the arrival date. But we can find a good location for it."

They spent the next hour debating the optimal placement of cat supplies—the litter box in the mudroom, the food bowls near the kitchen, the question of scratching posts and sleeping spots. Tenchi's energy finally began to fade as bedtime approached, the emotional intensity of the day catching up with him. By the time he was settled in his futon, Usagi-chan clutched to his chest, he was still murmuring about kittens and names and the wonderful future that awaited.

"Thank you," he said to Sheldon, as sleep began to claim him. "For taking me to see them. For helping Grandpa decide."

"I did very little. Your grandfather made his own decision."

"You helped. You always help." The boy's eyes were closing. "That's what you do."

He was asleep before Sheldon could respond.

---

Later, on the engawa, the stars blazed overhead.

"You look thoughtful," Katsuhito observed.

"I am thinking about what Tenchi said. That helping is what I do."

"Is that troubling?"

"No. It is... unexpected. In my previous life, I was not known for helping. I was known for achievement, for ambition, for pushing boundaries. Helping others was not my primary mode of being."

"Perhaps you have changed."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps this is who I always was, underneath the ambition. Perhaps the circumstances simply did not allow it to emerge."

Katsuhito made a sound of acknowledgment. "We are shaped by our environments. A seed planted in poor soil grows differently than one planted in rich soil. The potential is the same; the expression differs."

"You think I was planted in poor soil before?"

"I think you were planted in soil that nourished certain aspects of your nature and neglected others. Here, the soil is different. Different aspects are being nourished."

It was an elegant way of framing his transformation. Not a fundamental change in who he was, but a revealing of dimensions that had been dormant.

"The roof is complete," Sheldon said, changing the subject. "Tanaka-san conducted the final inspection today. The house is sound."

"Good. Then the next phase can begin. Have you contacted Hashimoto?"

"Not yet. I will do so tomorrow."

"He is usually available quickly. The tatami work may begin within the week."

"That would be efficient."

"Efficiency matters when winter is only months away. A house without proper floors is unpleasant in cold weather."

They sat in comfortable silence, the night sounds washing over them. Crickets and frogs, the rustle of wind in the great tree, the occasional hoot of an owl in the distance.

"Twelve days," Katsuhito said quietly. "You have been here twelve days."

"It feels like both longer and shorter."

"That is often how significant periods feel. The days are long but the weeks are short." The old man stretched slightly, his old bones protesting. "Tomorrow is Saturday. No school for Tenchi. Perhaps you might take him to work on your fort."

"I would enjoy that."

"Good. He needs distraction, or the wait for the kitten will consume him entirely."

"And you? What will you do?"

"I will attend to shrine business. There are always duties that require attention when no one else is present to interrupt." A slight smile. "And perhaps I will practice calligraphy. I found my wife's brushes during our cleaning. It seems time to learn what she tried to teach me."

"That is a beautiful way to honor her memory."

"It is the only way I know. To carry forward what we loved about those we have lost." Katsuhito rose slowly. "Goodnight, Tsukino-san. Sleep well."

"Goodnight, Masaki-san. Thank you for today."

The old man paused at the door. "Thank me?"

"For deciding yes. For the kitten. Tenchi will remember this day for the rest of his life."

"That is why I did it. Not for the kitten's sake, but for the memory it will create." Katsuhito's voice was soft. "We do not know how many such opportunities we will have. Better to seize them when they arise."

He disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the silence and the quiet satisfaction of a good day.

Twelve days. Nearly two weeks in this new life.

Tomorrow there would be fort-building and kitten discussions and the slow accumulation of the moments that made a life worth living. The house restoration would continue. The relationships would deepen. The threads of his existence here would weave themselves more tightly into the pattern.

One day at a time. One step at a time. One moment at a time.

The warmth hummed in his chest, constant and reassuring, a companion in the darkness.

He sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Tomorrow would come soon enough.

Tonight, he rested in the knowledge that something good had happened, and more good things were on the way.

⁂

## Day 13

---

## Saturday, April 15, 1989

---

The weekend arrived with the promise of adventure.

Tenchi was awake before Sheldon, a reversal of their usual pattern. The boy appeared at the door of Sheldon's room while the sky was still grey with early dawn, his face bright with anticipation.

"Today we go to Kurashiki! For the pet store!"

"I am aware. But the pet store will not open for several hours."

"I know. But I couldn't sleep anymore. I kept thinking about collars and toys and what color the collar should be and whether orange cats look better in blue collars or green collars or—"

"Perhaps you could think about these things quietly, in your own room, for another hour?"

Tenchi considered this proposal with obvious reluctance. "I could try. But the thinking is very loud."

"Loud thinking is still quieter than loud talking."

"That's true." The boy retreated, though Sheldon could hear him moving around in the adjacent room, the quiet sounds of someone trying and failing to be patient.

He rose anyway. Sleep had fled, replaced by the particular alertness that came from being needed. This was new—in his previous life, he had rarely been needed by anyone in the immediate, personal sense. His work had mattered in the abstract, but no one had waited outside his door, eager for his presence.

It was, he was discovering, both exhausting and deeply satisfying.

---

Breakfast was a hurried affair.

Tenchi ate with mechanical efficiency, his attention clearly elsewhere—on the pet store, on collars, on the kitten that would arrive in less than a week. Katsuhito observed with the patient amusement of someone who had seen this kind of excitement before.

"The bus to Kurashiki leaves at nine," the old man said. "We have time."

"What if we miss it?"

"Then we take the next one, at ten."

"But the nine o'clock bus is better. It's earlier."

"Earlier is not always better. But in this case, I agree—the nine o'clock bus will give us more time in the city."

They finished breakfast and cleaned up with unusual speed, Tenchi helping with the dishes without being asked—a sure sign of his desperation to depart. By eight-thirty, they were ready, standing at the top of the three hundred steps with the morning stretching before them.

"Today will be good," Tenchi announced. "I can feel it."

"What does a good day feel like?"

"Like this. Like everything is about to happen."

It was, Sheldon thought, as good a definition as any.

---

The bus to Kurashiki was familiar now.

Sheldon had made this journey twice before—once on his first exploration of the region, once for supplies. But this time felt different. This time he was not alone, not a stranger navigating unfamiliar territory. He was part of a small family unit, traveling together for a shared purpose.

The bus was half-full on a Saturday morning—families heading to the city for shopping, elderly couples visiting children or grandchildren, a few students with bags suggesting weekend activities. Sheldon recognized the driver from his previous trips; the man nodded in acknowledgment as they boarded.

Tenchi sat by the window, his nose pressed against the glass, watching the landscape scroll past with the attention of someone seeing it for the first time. The rice paddies were fully flooded now, their surfaces reflecting the sky like scattered mirrors. In some fields, farmers moved through the water, bent to their work; in others, the planting was already complete, rows of green seedlings standing in perfect lines.

"Why do they stand in the water?" Tenchi asked.

"They are planting rice seedlings. Each one must be placed by hand, in rows, at the proper spacing. The water protects the young plants and controls weeds."

"That sounds hard. Being bent over in water all day."

"It is hard. Rice farming is difficult work, one of the most labor-intensive forms of agriculture. But it feeds the nation. Japan could not exist without rice farmers."

"I'm glad someone does it. I like rice."

"Most people like rice. That is why someone does it." Sheldon watched a farmer straighten, stretching his back, before bending again to continue the planting. "There was a time when almost everyone did this work. Now, fewer and fewer young people are willing. They go to cities for office jobs."

"Is that bad?"

"It is... complicated. The cities need workers too. But if no one plants rice, there will be no rice to eat. Every society must balance these needs."

Tenchi considered this with the seriousness he brought to topics that interested him. "Maybe they should make rice planting easier. With machines or something."

"They have, to some extent. But machines cannot do everything. Some work still requires human hands."

Katsuhito sat across the aisle, his eyes closed, apparently resting. But Sheldon suspected he was listening, evaluating, observing even in stillness. The old man missed very little.

The bus wound through small villages and past larger towns, the landscape gradually shifting from rural to suburban to urban. The houses grew closer together, the rice paddies gave way to commercial buildings, the open sky was interrupted by power lines and taller structures.

Kurashiki appeared on the horizon—a city of moderate size, its skyline marked by the particular mix of old and new that characterized so much of Japan. Traditional buildings stood beside modern ones, their coexistence somehow harmonious rather than jarring.

They disembarked at the main station and stood for a moment, orienting themselves. The station was busy with Saturday traffic—families, couples, groups of young people, all moving with the purposeful chaos of urban life.

"The pet store is in the Bikan district," Katsuhito said. "We will walk. It is not far, and the district is worth seeing."

"I've been there before," Tenchi said. "With Mom. She liked the canal."

"Your mother loved the canal. She said it reminded her of paintings she had seen of Venice."

"What's Venice?"

"A city in Italy. Built on water, with canals instead of streets. Very beautiful, by all accounts."

"Italy is far away."

"Very far. Across the sea and across continents. But beauty exists everywhere, and sometimes beautiful places remind us of other beautiful places, even if we have never seen them ourselves."

They walked through streets that grew progressively older, the modern buildings giving way to traditional architecture. The transition was gradual—a old shop here, a preserved warehouse there—until they were surrounded by the white-walled buildings and willow-lined canal that marked the Bikan Historical Quarter.

Tenchi's attention was torn between the picturesque surroundings and the promise of the pet store ahead. He kept glancing at shop windows, clearly hoping to spot their destination.

"There!" He pointed to a storefront with a painted cat on its sign. "Is that it?"

"That is it."

---

The pet store was a small establishment, cramped but well-organized.

Shelves lined every wall, stacked with supplies for creatures of all kinds—dogs, cats, birds, fish, small mammals. The smell was particular: clean bedding, animal feed, the indefinable scent of places where creatures lived. A large tank near the entrance held colorful fish that Tenchi paused to examine before remembering his purpose.

A woman behind the counter looked up as they entered. She was middle-aged, with grey-streaked hair and the patient expression of someone who spent her days dealing with children and animals.

"Welcome! How can I help you?"

"We are getting a kitten," Tenchi announced, before anyone else could speak. "An orange one. He's coming next week. I need a collar and a toy."

"How exciting! Orange cats are wonderful. They tend to be very friendly and outgoing—real personalities." The woman emerged from behind the counter with the practiced ease of someone who dealt with excited children regularly. "Let me show you what we have."

She led them to a section of the store devoted to cat supplies. The selection was more extensive than Sheldon had expected—this small store clearly served a significant population of pet owners.

The collar selection proved particularly comprehensive. There were collars in every color and pattern—solid colors, stripes, checks, prints featuring fish or mice or abstract designs. There were collars with bells and collars without, collars that buckled and collars that snapped, collars sized for kittens and collars that adjusted as the cat grew.

"Too many choices," Tenchi said, his voice slightly overwhelmed.

"Take your time," the woman advised. "The collar will be with your cat for a long time—perhaps years, if you choose an adjustable one. It should feel right."

"What do most people choose?"

"That depends on the cat and the owner. Some prefer simple colors that complement the cat's fur. Others like patterns that express personality. Some want bells so they can hear where the cat is; others prefer quiet collars so the cat can hunt." She smiled. "There is no wrong answer, as long as the collar fits properly and is comfortable for the cat."

Sheldon watched as Tenchi moved slowly along the display, his small fingers reaching out to touch different options. The boy's earlier excitement had transformed into something more focused—the serious attention of someone making an important decision.

He picked up a red collar, considered it, set it back. A green collar with fish printed on it—he held it longer, turning it in his hands, before returning it to its hook. A plain black collar that he dismissed immediately as "too boring."

"What do you think?" Tenchi asked, holding up a blue collar with a small silver bell.

"It is a good color. Blue complements orange well—they are complementary colors on the color wheel."

"What's a color wheel?"

"A way of organizing colors to show which ones look good together. Blue and orange are across from each other, which means they create pleasant contrast."

"So blue is the right choice?"

"It is a good choice. But the right choice is whichever one feels right to you."

Tenchi set the blue collar aside and continued looking, comparing it to other options. A green collar with a fish pattern—"But there are already fish on the canal, I don't want fish on the collar too." A red collar that seemed too bold—"It might scare him." A simple black collar that felt too plain—"He's not a plain cat, he's special."

In the end, he returned to the blue collar with the bell.

"This one. It's right. I can feel it."

"An excellent choice," the woman said. "The bell will help you find him when he hides—kittens are very good at hiding—and the blue will look lovely against his orange fur."

The toy selection was equally extensive, occupying another section of the store. There were balls and mice and feathered wands, crinkly tunnels and automated devices that moved on their own, scratching posts and climbing structures of varying complexity.

Tenchi moved through it with more confidence than he had shown with the collars. He rejected the elaborate automated toys ("Too complicated—cats like simple things, Yamamoto-san said"), considered and set aside several feathered options ("Maybe later, when he's bigger and can catch them"), examined the various balls ("Too easy to lose under furniture"), and finally selected a small mouse on a string that could be dangled and dragged.

"Cats like to chase," he explained to Sheldon, as though sharing expert knowledge. "This mouse will be good for chasing practice. He can pounce on it and pretend he's hunting."

"You have done research."

"I read a book from the school library. And Yamamoto-san told me things." He held up the mouse, examining it critically. The mouse was small and brown, with a long string attached to its tail. "Plus, I watched the kittens play at her house. They liked chasing things that moved fast and then stopped suddenly."

"Observation is the foundation of understanding."

"That sounds like something Grandpa would say."

"Your grandfather is a wise man. We often reach similar conclusions."

---

They paid for their purchases and emerged into the spring sunshine.

The Bikan district was filling with tourists now, couples and families wandering along the canal, photographing the willow trees and white-walled buildings. The scene was picturesque in a way that felt almost staged—too perfect to be entirely real. And yet it was real, preserved through decades of deliberate effort, a conscious choice to maintain the past in the face of modernity.

"Can we walk along the canal?" Tenchi asked. "Mom used to like that."

"We can."

They walked slowly, Tenchi carrying his bag of purchases like a treasure. The canal water was clear and still, reflecting the buildings and trees above. The white walls and black tile roofs created patterns that doubled in the water, symmetry above and below.

Willow trees lined the banks, their long branches trailing toward the water, swaying gently in a breeze that carried the scent of spring flowers. Small boats were moored at intervals—once used for commerce, now maintained for tourists who wanted to experience the canal as it had been.

Koi fish moved lazily in the shallows, their orange and white scales catching the light. Some were large—as long as Tenchi's arm—and they moved with the unhurried confidence of creatures that had never known predators.

"The fish are orange," Tenchi observed. "Like my kitten."

"Koi are often orange. It is a traditional color—associated with good fortune and courage."

"Then my kitten will be lucky and brave."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps he will make his own luck, with the help of a caring owner. Courage, too, can be nurtured."

They paused on a small bridge, looking down at the water. The bridge was wooden, arched in the traditional style, its railings worn smooth by countless hands. Below, the koi gathered, apparently accustomed to people and the treats they sometimes brought.

Tourists flowed around them, but for a moment, the three of them existed in a bubble of stillness—grandfather, child, and the stranger who had become something more.

"Mom stood here once," Tenchi said quietly. "She showed me the fish and told me about wishes."

"What kind of wishes?"

"She said if you throw a coin in the water and make a wish, the fish carry it to the gods." He looked down at the swimming koi. "I didn't have a coin that day. She gave me one of hers."

"What did you wish for?"

"I don't remember. Something about toys, probably. I was little." A pause, his voice growing smaller. "If I had a coin now, I would wish for something different."

Katsuhito produced a coin from his pocket and handed it to his grandson without comment. The gesture was simple, but it carried the weight of understanding—of knowing what the boy needed without being told.

Tenchi held the coin for a moment, his small face serious with concentration. The coin was a hundred-yen piece, its silver surface catching the light. He turned it over in his fingers, seemingly gathering his thoughts, deciding what to wish for.

Then he closed his eyes, moved his lips silently, and tossed the coin into the water. It fell with a soft splash, spinning down through the clear water, flashing as it caught the light, until it came to rest on the bottom among others—a collection of hopes and wishes from countless visitors before.

The koi gathered around it briefly, investigating, then lost interest and drifted away.

"What did you wish for?" Sheldon asked.

"I can't tell. Then it won't come true." But there was something in the boy's eyes—something that suggested the wish was not about toys or kittens or anything so simple. Something deeper, something that touched on the mother who had stood here with him, the family that had been and the family that remained.

Sheldon did not press. Some things were private, even between people who had grown close.

They continued walking, the moment passing but not forgotten. The canal stretched before them, leading past more warehouses and willows, past shops selling local crafts and restaurants offering traditional food. The past and present coexisted here, each informing the other, neither fully dominant.

---

Lunch was at a small restaurant near the canal.

The menu featured local specialties—various preparations of rice and fish, the regional vegetables that Sheldon was beginning to recognize, a particular style of noodle soup that Katsuhito recommended.

"The dashi here is excellent," the old man said. "They make it fresh each morning, in the traditional way."

They ordered and waited, the restaurant filling gradually with the lunch crowd. Tenchi examined his purchases again, taking the collar out of its packaging to look at it in better light.

"Do you think he'll like it?" he asked.

"Cats do not generally have opinions about collars. They tolerate them."

"But do you think it's the right one?"

"I think it is a good collar, chosen with care and thought. That is what matters."

The food arrived—steaming bowls of soup, plates of grilled fish, small dishes of pickled vegetables. They ate in comfortable rhythm, the conversation flowing easily between bites.

"We should contact Hashimoto about the tatami," Katsuhito said, addressing Sheldon. "The insect activity Tanaka-san mentioned is concerning."

"I planned to call him Monday."

"Good. The sooner he can assess the situation, the better. If the insects have spread, the damage may be more extensive than we hoped."

"What insects?" Tenchi asked.

"Small creatures that eat tatami. They can damage the mats if left untreated."

"That sounds bad."

"It can be. That is why we address it quickly."

The conversation moved to other topics—the state of the shrine, the approach of the rice planting festival, the various tasks that awaited them in the coming weeks. Sheldon listened and contributed, feeling the familiar pleasure of being included in the planning of a life he was building.

---

After lunch, they explored the district further.

Katsuhito led them to shops he remembered from previous visits—an antique store where he had once purchased a scroll, a tea house where the owner remembered his name, a small museum dedicated to the region's history.

The museum was unexpectedly interesting. It told the story of the area from ancient times through the modern period, with displays of artifacts, photographs, and reconstructions. The building itself was a converted warehouse, its high ceilings and exposed beams creating an atmosphere that felt appropriate to its historical contents.

Tenchi was particularly fascinated by the section on traditional crafts—the weaving, the pottery, the metalwork that had once made this region famous. Display cases held examples of each craft, some centuries old, their quality evident even to untrained eyes.

"People made all this by hand?" he asked, staring at a display of intricate fabric.

"They did. Before machines, everything was made by hand. Every piece of cloth, every pot, every tool—all created through human skill and patience."

"That must have taken forever."

"It took time. But the results were often more beautiful and more durable than what machines produce. Look at the evenness of this weaving—each thread placed deliberately, each pattern intentional."

The fabric in the display was silk, dyed in deep blues and golds, its pattern depicting scenes from nature—birds among branches, fish swimming in streams. The colors had faded slightly with age but remained vibrant, speaking to the quality of the original dyes and the skill of their application.

"Like Grandpa's shrine stuff? The old things are prettier than new things."

"That is often true. Old things were made with care that modern production does not allow. When a craftsman spent months on a single piece, they could achieve a level of quality that is simply not economical in modern manufacturing."

"But isn't it better to have lots of okay things than a few really good things?"

It was a surprisingly sophisticated question. "That depends on what you value. Modern production makes things accessible—more people can have them. But something is lost in the exchange. The connection between maker and object, the uniqueness of individual creation."

They moved through the museum slowly, Sheldon finding himself genuinely engaged. The history of this region was not something he had studied before, but it connected to broader patterns he was beginning to understand—the way traditional knowledge was created, preserved, and eventually lost.

One section was devoted to the rice trade that had made Kurashiki wealthy in centuries past. The warehouses along the canal—the same ones they had walked past—had stored rice collected from the entire region, awaiting shipment to Osaka and Edo. The display included models of the boats that had carried the rice, the tools used to measure and store it, the accounting systems that tracked transactions.

"Rice made this city," the explanatory text read. "And the wealth from rice made possible the arts and crafts that Kurashiki became known for. The merchants who grew rich on trade became patrons of culture, supporting artists and craftsmen whose work still survives today."

Another section documented the region's history of metalwork. For centuries, smiths here had produced tools and implements prized throughout Japan. The display showed the evolution of techniques—from simple forging to complex processes involving multiple alloys and treatments.

One display caught Sheldon's particular attention: a collection of tools from a traditional workshop, arranged as they would have been in use. The quality of the metalwork was evident even behind glass—edges that had been honed to precision, handles that had been shaped for specific hands, surfaces that showed the marks of their creation.

"These are beautiful," he said.

Katsuhito nodded. "The craftsmen of this region were famous. Their tools were sought throughout Japan. A plane from a Kurashiki smith was worth ten times one from elsewhere."

"Is this tradition still alive?"

"Barely. There are a few masters left, but they have few students. The young prefer easier work, faster money." The old man's voice carried familiar sadness. "In another generation, the skills may be gone entirely."

"Could they not be documented? Preserved in books or films?"

"Some have been. But documentation is not the same as living knowledge. You can read about how to forge a blade, but you cannot learn it without years of practice under a master's guidance. The knowledge lives in hands and eyes, not in books."

Sheldon thought about Hideo's tools, waiting in the house below. About Tanaka's cutting blade, made by his grandfather's brother. About the weaving frame in Katsuhito's storage shed, its purpose now forgotten, its techniques lost.

So much was being lost. So much could never be recovered.

But some things could still be saved. Some knowledge could still be preserved. If there were people willing to learn, willing to take the time, willing to value the old ways even as the world rushed toward the new.

Could he be one of those people? Could he carry forward even a fraction of what was being lost?

He did not know. But he was beginning to think he wanted to try.

---

They caught the afternoon bus back to Masaki Village.

The return journey felt different from the morning's trip—slower, quieter, the excitement of anticipation replaced by the satisfaction of accomplishment. The bus was less crowded than the morning one had been, most passengers heading toward the city rather than away from it.

Tenchi claimed the window seat again, but this time his attention was divided between the passing landscape and his bag of purchases. He took out the collar several times, examining it in the changing light, imagining it around his kitten's neck.

"Four more days," he murmured. "Maybe five."

"The time will pass."

"Not fast enough."

Halfway through the journey, Tenchi's eyes grew heavy. The day's excitement—the early waking, the walking, the emotions of the canal and the museum—had finally caught up with him. His head nodded, then drooped, and finally came to rest against Sheldon's arm.

For a moment, Sheldon was uncertain what to do. The position was slightly awkward, and his instinct was to adjust, to create proper distance. But something stopped him—perhaps the weight of the small head against his arm, perhaps the peace in the boy's sleeping face, perhaps simply the recognition that this was what family felt like.

He sat still and let Tenchi sleep.

Katsuhito observed from across the aisle, his expression thoughtful.

"He trusts you," the old man said quietly, keeping his voice low to avoid disturbing his grandson.

"I am trying to be worthy of that trust."

"You are succeeding." Katsuhito's voice was thoughtful. "He has not slept on anyone since his mother died. He was afraid to—afraid that they might disappear while he was not watching."

"I did not know that."

"He would not have told you. He probably does not fully understand it himself. It is not something he thinks consciously—it is something his body knows. Something that operates beneath the level of words." Katsuhito looked at his grandson's sleeping face. "But his body has decided you are safe. That is not a decision easily made."

The weight of this settled around Sheldon—the trust of a child who had learned too young that people could vanish, that safety was uncertain, that love did not protect against loss. And yet here he was, sleeping against a stranger who had arrived barely two weeks ago.

What had he done to earn this? He had simply been present. Simply shown up, day after day, doing the small things that added up to reliability. He had not done anything heroic or extraordinary—just the ordinary work of building a relationship.

Perhaps that was the lesson. Perhaps extraordinary trust came not from extraordinary actions but from the steady accumulation of ordinary ones.

"I will not disappear," Sheldon said.

"I know. That is why I am telling you this." Katsuhito met his eyes across the aisle, his gaze direct and serious. "You have become important to him. More important than you probably realize. When the kitten arrives, you will be part of that joy. When struggles come—and they will—you will be part of the support he needs."

"I understand."

"Do you?" The old man's voice was gentle but insistent. "This is not a temporary arrangement, Tsukino-san. You have woven yourself into our lives. The threads cannot be easily undone. If you leave now—if you leave ever—there will be consequences. He will feel it as another loss."

"I do not intend to leave."

"Intentions are not certainties. Life is unpredictable. But you should know what is at stake. You should understand the weight of what you have built."

"I do. And I do not wish to undo it. I wish to continue building."

"Good." Katsuhito settled back in his seat, the intensity of the moment passing. "Then we understand each other."

The bus continued through the afternoon light, past rice paddies now painted gold by the lowering sun, past villages where smoke rose from evening cooking fires, carrying them back to the mountain and the shrine and the life they were building together.

Tenchi slept on, oblivious to the conversation that had passed above him, trusting in his sleep that he would be safe until he woke.

---

The evening was quiet.

Tenchi woke when they arrived at the village, groggy but cheerful, and insisted on carrying his purchases up the three hundred steps himself. The climb seemed longer after a day of walking, but they made it without incident.

Dinner was simple—rice, soup, leftover fish from the previous day. The conversation was subdued, the day's adventures having drained everyone's energy. Tenchi kept taking out the collar and the toy mouse, examining them, imagining the kitten that would soon wear and play with them.

"Five more days," he said, counting on his fingers. "Or maybe four. Wednesday or Thursday, Yamamoto-san said."

"The days will pass quickly."

"They won't. They'll pass slowly. I know because I'll be counting every one."

"Then find ways to fill them. Work on the fort. Help with shrine chores. The time will pass faster if you are occupied."

"That's what Grandpa always says."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"You always say that too."

"Because it is always true."

Bath time and bedtime followed the usual pattern. Tenchi was asleep almost before his head touched the pillow, the day's exertions finally catching up with him. Usagi-chan was displaced slightly by the new mouse toy, which Tenchi insisted on keeping close "so it will smell like me when the kitten arrives."

"That is thoughtful," Sheldon said.

"Cats like familiar smells. Yamamoto-san said so."

"Then it is good that you are preparing."

He sat with the sleeping boy for a few minutes, as had become his custom. The small face was peaceful, the tension of waking hours smoothed away by sleep. The trust that Katsuhito had spoken of was visible in every line of that relaxed body—the complete surrender of someone who felt safe.

---

Later, on the engawa, Sheldon sat alone.

Katsuhito had retired early, his old bones protesting after the day of walking. The night was clear and cool, the stars brilliant overhead, the sounds of the forest creating a gentle backdrop to his thoughts.

Thirteen days. Nearly two weeks in this new life.

He had accomplished more than he would have believed possible. A house being restored. A place in a family. Relationships with villagers and craftsmen. A routine that gave structure to his days and meaning to his efforts.

And now, a child who slept against him without fear. A trust that carried responsibilities he was only beginning to understand.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, as it always did in these contemplative moments. Whatever it was—whatever power had brought him here and sustained him—it seemed content with the progress being made. It offered no guidance, no direction, just presence. A companion in the journey.

His grandmother would have called it grace. The unearned gift that made everything else possible. She had believed in such things—in powers beyond human understanding, in purposes beyond individual comprehension. He had always been skeptical, preferring explanations that fit within the frameworks of science.

Now, sitting beneath stars that had witnessed his impossible resurrection, feeling a warmth that defied all physics he knew, he was less certain of his skepticism. Perhaps there were more things in heaven and earth than were dreamt of in his philosophy. Perhaps the proper response was not to demand explanations but to accept with gratitude.

The stars wheeled overhead, ancient and indifferent and beautiful. The crickets sang their endless song. The great tree stood as a dark silhouette against the sky, its presence constant and reassuring.

Tomorrow was Sunday. Another day of rest and work and the slow accumulation of moments that made a life. The fort might be finished. The shrine would need tending. Tenchi would count down the days until his kitten arrived.

And Sheldon would be there for all of it. Present, consistent, becoming more rooted with each passing day.

He sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

The warmth settled around him like a blanket, gentle and constant, as he drifted toward dreams.

Tomorrow would come soon enough.

Tonight, he rested in the knowledge that he was exactly where he needed to be.

## Day 14

## Sunday, April 16, 1989

---

Two weeks.

Sheldon lay in his futon in the grey pre-dawn light, counting days in his mind. Fourteen days since he had woken in a field with no memory of how he had arrived. Fourteen days since the warmth had first stirred in his chest. Fourteen days of building a life from nothing.

It seemed both impossibly short and remarkably long. So much had changed in two weeks. He had a place to live, a family to belong to, work that gave his days meaning. He had relationships with villagers, knowledge of traditional crafts, a house under restoration. He had a small boy who slept against him without fear and an old man who trusted him with that boy's care.

Two weeks ago, he had been dead. Or as good as dead—his previous life ended, his consciousness somehow transplanted across decades and continents. Now he was more alive than he had ever been.

The warmth hummed quietly in his chest, as though acknowledging the milestone. Whatever it was, whatever power had brought him here, it seemed satisfied with the progress being made.

He rose to meet the day.

---

Sunday at the shrine had its own particular rhythm.

There were no school buses, no weekday routines, no obligations beyond the basic maintenance of the grounds. Katsuhito emerged from his room later than usual, moving with the careful slowness of someone whose body protested early morning activity. The mountain chill seemed to settle deeper on Sundays, as though the day itself moved at a gentler pace.

"Tea first," he said, by way of greeting. "Then we discuss the day."

They sat together in the kitchen, the morning light strengthening through the windows, drinking tea in companionable silence. Tenchi was still asleep—the previous day's excitement had exhausted him thoroughly, and he showed no signs of waking. The trip to Kurashiki, the shopping, the bus rides—it had been a full day for a five-year-old.

"Let him rest," Katsuhito said, when Sheldon glanced toward the boy's room. "Growing children need sleep. And he will need energy for the week ahead."

"The kitten arrives in a few days."

"Yes. Wednesday or Thursday, Yamamoto-san said. She will confirm tomorrow." The old man sipped his tea, the steam rising in gentle curls. "I have made a decision about the living arrangements."

"Oh?"

"The kitten will stay in the mudroom initially, as we discussed. But once it is trained—perhaps a month or two—it may have access to the main house. Including Tenchi's room." He set down his cup with the careful precision that characterized all his movements. "I realized I was being unnecessarily rigid. A child who wants a companion should not be denied one for the sake of convenience."

"That is generous."

"It is practical. A happy child is an easier child. And Tenchi has earned happiness through his patience and preparation." Katsuhito's expression softened slightly. "He has worked hard to prove himself responsible. I should acknowledge that effort."

"He will be pleased."

"He will be unbearable with excitement. But that is acceptable." A hint of humor touched the old man's eyes. "I have survived his enthusiasms before. I will survive this one."

They finished their tea and began the morning's work. Katsuhito retrieved his calligraphy brushes—the first time, Sheldon realized, that he had seen the old man prepare for practice since finding his wife's set during the storage shed cleaning. There was something ceremonial about the way he laid out the materials: the brushes arranged by size, the ink stone positioned precisely, the paper set at the correct angle.

"You are beginning seriously," Sheldon observed.

"If I am going to do this, I will do it properly. Achika would accept nothing less." Katsuhito examined the largest brush, turning it in his fingers. "She always said that preparation was half the art. The way you approach your materials determines the quality of what you produce."

"A principle that applies to many disciplines."

"To all disciplines, I think. Carpentry, cooking, calligraphy, even—" He paused, seemed to consider his next words carefully. "Even combat. How you prepare determines how you perform."

It was the first time Katsuhito had mentioned combat directly. Sheldon filed this observation away, noting the context and the careful way the old man had introduced the subject. There would be time to explore such things later.

For now, there was shrine work to do.

---

The morning sweep felt different on Sundays.

The pace was slower, more contemplative. There were no worries about schedules, no awareness of buses or school bells or weekday obligations. The shrine existed in its own time, and Sheldon moved through it with matching patience.

The cherry blossoms were nearly finished now. The last of the petals drifted down in the still morning air, settling on the swept stones like pale pink snow. In another day or two, the trees would be fully leafed, their spring display complete. The cycle was ending, making way for summer's green abundance.

Sheldon swept the petals into soft piles, handling them gently. There was something precious about these final fragments of the bloom—the last tangible evidence of the spectacular display that had marked his first weeks in Japan. He had arrived during the cherry blossom season, and now that season was ending. It felt like a threshold crossed.

The frog was back.

It sat on the same stone basin as before, regarding Sheldon with what might have been recognition. The morning light caught its mottled skin, highlighting patterns of green and brown that served as camouflage in the forest but made it conspicuous against the grey stone.

"You again," Sheldon said.

The frog blinked, its vertical pupils contracting slightly.

"I am beginning to think you live here."

Another blink. The frog showed no inclination to dispute this observation. Its throat pulsed gently, the only sign of any internal activity.

"Do you have a name? Surely someone in the village has named you by now."

The frog offered no response to this question. It sat in perfect stillness, a small monument to amphibian patience.

Sheldon changed the water around his small green observer, now accustomed to the routine. The fresh water was cool from the well, clear and clean. He poured it carefully, avoiding direct contact with the frog, watching as the creature adjusted its position slightly to accommodate the rising level.

When he finished, the frog hopped into the fresh water with evident satisfaction. It settled onto its favorite rock—a flat stone just below the surface, positioned to catch the morning light—and resumed its contemplation of the universe.

"You are welcome," Sheldon said.

The frog did not respond, but there was something that might have been acknowledgment in the way it settled deeper into its chosen spot. Or perhaps Sheldon was projecting human responses onto an animal that was simply enjoying the temperature of the water.

Either way, the exchange had become a ritual. Another small pattern in the larger fabric of shrine life.

---

Tenchi emerged around mid-morning, still drowsy but recovering.

He appeared in the kitchen doorway, hair disheveled, wearing the same clothes he had slept in. His eyes were heavy with sleep, and he moved with the careful uncertainty of someone not fully awake.

"What time is it? Did I miss anything? Is it still Sunday?"

"It is still Sunday. You missed nothing but breakfast, which we saved for you."

"Oh good." He rubbed his eyes with both fists, the gesture making him look even younger than his five years. "I was dreaming about the kitten. In my dream, he could talk. He said his name was Hikaru."

"Hikaru? Light?"

"Yeah. Because he's orange like sunshine." Tenchi considered this, his forehead wrinkling with thought. "That's a good name. Maybe I should use it."

"You said you wanted to wait until you knew him."

"I do. But the dream might have been telling me something." He yawned enormously, his whole body participating in the expression of fatigue. "What are we doing today?"

"After you eat, I thought we might finish the fort. The walls are not yet complete."

The drowsiness vanished, replaced by immediate alertness. His posture changed, his eyes sharpened, his energy transformed from sleepy to eager in an instant.

"Yes! The fort! I almost forgot about the fort with all the kitten excitement!"

"Your enthusiasm is noted."

Tenchi ate his breakfast with efficient speed—rice and pickled vegetables, consumed with the focused determination of someone who had places to be. He dressed in old clothes suitable for forest work, appeared at the door ready to depart before Sheldon had finished his morning tea.

"Now?"

"Let me finish my tea. The forest will wait."

"The forest waits, but I don't." Still, he sat down to wait, his feet bouncing with contained energy. His patience had improved over the past two weeks, but it still had limits. "How much longer?"

"A few minutes. Practice your patience."

"I am practicing. This is me practicing." The feet continued to bounce. "See? I'm sitting and waiting. That's patience."

"It is a form of patience, yes."

Sheldon finished his tea at a deliberately normal pace, neither rushing to accommodate Tenchi's eagerness nor slowing to test it. The tea was good—slightly bitter, warming, exactly what a Sunday morning required. When it was done, he rose and collected the tools they would need.

"Now?" Tenchi asked, already on his feet.

"Now."

---

The fort had weathered the week well.

The framework remained solid, the partial roof intact, the repairs they had made after the rain holding up. Sunlight filtered through the trees, dappling the structure with shifting patterns of light and shadow. It looked, Sheldon thought, like something from a storybook—a secret hideaway in the woods, a place where adventures might begin.

But the walls were still incomplete—more suggestion than reality, a few branches placed but no real barrier against the elements or imaginary enemies. The gaps between the structural posts remained open, allowing clear sightlines in and out.

"Today we finish," Tenchi declared, his voice full of determination. "Today it becomes a real fort."

"What makes a fort real?"

"Walls. Real forts have walls. Otherwise, they're just... roofs on sticks."

"That is a reasonable definition."

They set to work with the rhythm they had developed over their previous sessions. Tenchi gathered materials—branches of suitable size, leafy brush for filling gaps—while Sheldon positioned and secured them. The wall-building was slower than the roof had been; walls required more structural integrity, more attention to how pieces fit together.

The warmth in Sheldon's chest assisted subtly, as it always did during physical work. His hands were steady, his judgment of angles and positions precise, his stamina exceeding what his body should reasonably provide. The enhancement was gentle enough to pass unnoticed, strong enough to make the difference between adequate work and excellent work.

"Like this?" Tenchi held up a branch, showing how he thought it should be placed.

"Almost. Angle it slightly more—there. Now it will shed rain instead of collecting it."

"Everything is about rain."

"In construction, yes. Rain is the enemy. Every design choice must consider how water will flow, where it will collect, what damage it might do."

"Tanaka-san said that too. About the roof."

"He was right. The same principles apply at every scale." Sheldon secured the branch in place with the lashing technique he had taught Tenchi earlier—wrapping the rope in a specific pattern that tightened under stress rather than loosening. "Your fort, a house, a castle—all must contend with rain."

"Even castles?"

"Especially castles. Castles are very large, which means they have very large roofs, which means they must handle very large amounts of water. The drainage systems in old castles were works of engineering genius."

Tenchi absorbed this information with the seriousness he brought to all new knowledge. "I want to see a castle someday."

"Perhaps we can arrange that. There are many castles in Japan."

"Have you been to one?"

"Not yet. But I would like to visit." Sheldon finished the lashing and tested the branch's stability. It held firm. "Architecture interests me. How people have solved building problems across different times and places."

"That's a lot of problems."

"Yes. Humans have been building things for thousands of years. Each generation learned from the one before, solved problems their predecessors could not solve, made new mistakes for the next generation to fix."

"Like the fort. We made mistakes, then we fixed them."

"Exactly like the fort."

They worked through the morning, the wall taking shape branch by branch. The forest was quiet around them, the sounds of their work the only interruption to the birdsong and wind. Occasionally, a deer would appear in the distance, watching them with curious eyes before drifting away into the green shadows.

"Can I ask you something?" Tenchi said, during a pause to rest.

"Of course."

"When you first came here—when you woke up in the field—were you scared?"

He had asked this before, Sheldon remembered. About fear, about what you do when you're scared. But something in Tenchi's voice suggested this question was different, deeper. There was a weight to it that had not been there before.

"Yes. I was very scared."

"What were you most scared of?"

Sheldon considered how to answer. The truth was complex—he had been scared of many things. Scared of being discovered, scared of failing to adapt, scared of the unknown power that hummed in his chest. But beneath all of those fears had been something more fundamental.

"I was scared of being alone. Of having no one who knew me, no one who cared whether I lived or died. I was scared of being lost in a way that could not be fixed."

"But you weren't alone. You found us."

"Yes. I found you. Or perhaps you found me."

"Grandpa found you," Tenchi corrected. "On the road. He said you looked tired and confused and very lost."

"All of those things were true."

"But now you're not lost anymore. Right?"

"Right. Now I know exactly where I am."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied. But after a moment, he spoke again, his voice smaller, more vulnerable.

"I get scared sometimes too. About being alone. About what would happen if Grandpa... if something happened."

"I know. We talked about this before."

"I know. But I keep thinking about it. Especially at night, when it's dark and quiet." He picked at a piece of bark on a branch, not meeting Sheldon's eyes. "I try not to think about it, but my brain doesn't listen."

"Brains rarely listen to instructions. They have their own priorities."

"That's annoying."

"It is. Very annoying." Sheldon set down the branch he had been positioning, giving the conversation his full attention. "May I tell you something?"

"Yes."

"When I was young—younger than you, even—I also worried about being alone. My parents were not kind people. They did not make me feel safe. The only person who made me feel safe was my grandmother, and I only saw her in summers."

Tenchi looked up, his eyes wide. "Your parents weren't kind?"

"No. They were... difficult people. They cared about themselves more than about me." It was strange to speak these words aloud. He had rarely discussed his childhood, even in his previous life. The wounds were old, but they had never fully healed. "I spent a lot of time afraid. Afraid of making them angry, afraid of being punished, afraid of what would happen when I grew up and had to face the world alone."

"What happened?"

"I grew up. I left them. I made my own life." He paused, searching for words that a five-year-old could understand. "But the fear did not fully go away. It changed into different fears—fear of failure, fear of being unworthy, fear of never accomplishing enough to matter."

"Do you still have those fears?"

Sheldon considered this honestly. "Some of them, yes. But they are quieter now. Coming here, finding you and your grandfather—it has helped. I am learning that there are other ways to matter. That being present for the people you love is as important as any achievement."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, processing this. His small face was serious, his eyes thoughtful. Finally, he said: "I'm glad you came here. Even if you were scared. I'm glad you stayed."

"So am I."

"And I'm glad you're scared sometimes too. It makes me feel less weird for being scared."

"Everyone is scared sometimes, Tenchi. The brave people are just the ones who do things anyway."

"Like Mom?"

"Yes. Like your mother. And like you."

The boy's expression shifted—not sadness exactly, but something deeper. The acknowledgment of loss that lived beneath all his other emotions.

"She was really brave," he said. "Grandpa told me. He said she was braver than anyone he knew."

"Then you come by it honestly."

"What does that mean?"

"It means bravery runs in your family. You inherited it from her."

Tenchi considered this, and slowly, a small smile appeared. "I like that. That she gave me her bravery."

"She gave you many things. You carry them with you every day."

---

By midday, the walls were complete.

They stood back to admire their work. The fort had transformed from a skeletal framework to something that looked genuinely functional—a small enclosure with walls on three sides, a partial roof overhead, space inside for a child to sit or lie down comfortably. The branches were woven together tightly enough to block most of the wind, with gaps small enough to see through but too small for easy entry.

"It's real now," Tenchi said, his voice full of wonder. "It's a real fort."

"It is. You built it."

"We built it. Together." He turned to Sheldon, his expression earnest. "I couldn't have done it without you."

"You could have done something. Perhaps not exactly this, but something. You have the skills now—you understand how pieces fit together, how to make structures stable. Next time, you could build one on your own."

"Maybe. But it's better with someone." Tenchi ducked through the entrance—a gap in the wall just large enough for a small body—and sat inside, looking out at the forest. "It's cozy in here. Like a nest."

Sheldon crouched at the entrance, not entering uninvited. "What will you use it for?"

"Thinking. Reading. Hiding from imaginary enemies." A pause, longer than the others. "Talking to Mom, maybe. When I want to be somewhere quiet."

"Those are all good uses for a fort."

"Will you come here sometimes? To visit?"

"If you invite me."

"I invite you. You're always invited. Because you helped build it." Tenchi patted the ground beside him. "See? There's room for two people. I made sure."

Sheldon accepted the invitation, maneuvering carefully through the entrance. The space was small but not cramped—designed, he realized, with exactly this purpose in mind. Room for a boy and one trusted adult.

"It's nice," he said, looking around at the woven walls, the filtered light, the sense of enclosure without confinement.

"I know." Tenchi's voice carried quiet pride. "We did a good job."

They sat together in the fort, listening to the forest sounds, feeling the peace of the hidden space. The moment stretched, comfortable and complete.

Then Tenchi's stomach growled.

"Lunch time?" Sheldon asked.

"Lunch time."

---

Lunch was rice balls and pickled vegetables, eaten on the engawa in the warming spring sun.

Katsuhito joined them, his calligraphy practice apparently complete. There was ink on his fingers—evidence of actual work rather than mere preparation—and his expression carried a particular satisfaction. The look of someone who had done something difficult and meaningful.

"How did it go?" Sheldon asked.

"Poorly. My strokes are clumsy, my rhythm is off, my understanding of balance is clearly lacking." But there was contentment beneath the criticism. "I have not practiced in forty years. It will take time to recover what I have lost."

"Will you continue?"

"I will. Achika would have wanted me to." He looked at his ink-stained fingers, turning them in the light. "She tried for years to teach me. I was always too busy, always had other priorities. The shrine needed maintenance, the villagers needed guidance, there was always something that seemed more urgent."

"And now?"

"Now that I have time, she is not here to teach me. That is the cruelty of such things—we realize what matters only when it is too late."

"Perhaps she teaches you still. Through the brushes she chose, the techniques she demonstrated."

Katsuhito was quiet for a moment, his eyes distant. "That is a kind thought. Perhaps you are right." He turned to Tenchi. "The fort is finished?"

"Almost finished. We need to add some things, but the main part is done. It's a real fort now, with walls and everything."

"I would like to see it, when you are ready to show me."

"Really?" Tenchi's face lit up. "You want to see it?"

"Of course. You have been working on it for weeks. I should see the result of your labor."

"Tomorrow? After school? We could walk there together."

"Tomorrow would be acceptable."

Tenchi's excitement doubled. First the kitten, now his grandfather wanting to see the fort—the week ahead was shaping up to be extraordinary.

They ate in comfortable silence, the sun warming their faces, the sounds of the mountain filling the air. A hawk circled lazily overhead, riding the thermals that rose from the valley below. Somewhere in the trees, a woodpecker hammered its rhythmic tattoo.

"The week ahead will be busy," Katsuhito said. "The kitten arrives. The tatami work must be arranged. The normal rhythms of life continue."

"I will contact Hashimoto tomorrow about the tatami."

"Good. The insect problem will not wait. These things spread if left untended."

"Tanaka-san mentioned the same. He seemed concerned about the extent of the damage."

"Tanaka has good instincts. If he is concerned, we should be concerned." Katsuhito finished his rice ball and brushed the crumbs from his fingers. "But one task at a time. Today is Sunday. Today we rest."

---

The afternoon passed in quiet activity.

Katsuhito returned to his calligraphy, the sound of brush on paper audible from the main hall. Each stroke was deliberate, considered, part of a practice that sought perfection while accepting imperfection. Sheldon could hear the rhythm of it—the pause before each stroke, the careful movement, the moment of stillness after.

Tenchi worked on a drawing of his future kitten, rendered in the bright colors of childhood imagination. The orange was vivid, almost fluorescent, far brighter than any real cat. But the shape was recognizable, the posture correct. The cat was curled on what appeared to be Tenchi's futon, one eye open, watching.

"That's very good," Sheldon said, glancing at the work in progress.

"It's Hikaru. Or maybe Hikaru. I'm still deciding." Tenchi added whiskers with careful strokes. "I want him to look friendly."

"He does look friendly."

"Good. I want him to know I'm friendly too. So when he comes, he won't be scared."

Sheldon read his carpentry book, studying the section on traditional joinery with new appreciation after his weeks of practical experience. The text described techniques he had now seen in person—mortise and tenon joints, the careful fitting of wood to wood, the way traditional Japanese buildings moved with earthquakes rather than resisting them.

One passage caught his attention:

*"The master carpenter does not force materials into shapes they resist. He studies the grain of each piece, understands its strengths and weaknesses, and designs joints that allow the wood to do what it naturally does. The result is stronger than any forced connection—a building that breathes, that moves, that lasts centuries rather than decades."*

The philosophy resonated with Sheldon's approach to his new life. He was not forcing himself into a shape he resisted. He was allowing himself to become what this place and these people needed him to be. The result felt natural, sustainable, built to last.

He turned to the section on tool maintenance—another area where theoretical knowledge was gaining practical grounding. The text described methods for sharpening plane blades that matched what Katsuhito had demonstrated with the storage shed tools. It explained how to read the wear patterns on saw teeth to understand what corrections were needed. It discussed the importance of handles—how a tool that fit the hand reduced fatigue and improved precision.

Tomorrow, he needed to bring Hideo's tools to Tanaka for evaluation. The roofer had offered to examine them, to identify which could be restored and which should be replaced. It was another step toward establishing the repair shop—gathering the equipment he would need to serve the village.

The book mentioned suppliers in nearby cities, places where quality tools could be purchased. He would need to visit eventually, to see what was available, to begin assembling his workshop inventory. But that could wait. The immediate priority was the house restoration, the tatami repair, the electrical and plumbing work that would make the space functional.

One task at a time. One day at a time. The approach was working.

The knowledge connected to other knowledge. The joints in the carpentry book resembled the lashing techniques Tanaka had shown him on the roof. The principles of balance in the calligraphy Katsuhito practiced applied to the structural engineering in the book. Everything was connected, everything informed everything else.

This was how expertise developed, Sheldon realized. Not through isolated learning, but through the accumulation of connected knowledge. Each new skill illuminated the skills that had come before. The web of understanding grew denser, stronger, more capable of holding weight.

The warmth in his chest hummed its quiet agreement. Whatever it was, it seemed to approve of his approach. Of building rather than consuming, of connecting rather than accumulating.

---

Late in the afternoon, Sheldon visited the great tree.

He had developed a habit of doing this—approaching the tree at different times of day, observing how the light changed its appearance, how the warmth responded to its presence. It was not quite meditation and not quite study, but something in between. A practice without a name.

Today, the tree seemed particularly present. The afternoon light filtered through its leaves, creating patterns of gold and green on the ground below. The shimenawa rope around its trunk swayed slightly in the breeze, the paper streamers rustling like whispered prayers.

Sheldon stood before it and breathed.

The warmth stirred, responding to the tree's presence. Not communicating exactly—it never communicated in any way he could understand—but acknowledging. Recognizing. Two presences aware of each other across whatever distance separated their natures.

"I have been here two weeks," Sheldon said quietly. "Whatever you are, wherever you came from, you chose to bring me here. I do not know why, and I may never know. But I want you to know that I am grateful."

The tree did not respond. Of course it did not respond—trees did not speak, regardless of how ancient or significant they might be. But there was something—a sense of acknowledgment, perhaps, or simply the settling of ancient wood in the afternoon warmth.

"I am building something here. A life. A family. A place in this community. I do not know if that is what you intended, but it is what I am choosing." He paused, searching for words. "I will try to be worthy of this gift. To be good to the people who have accepted me. To contribute rather than just take."

The warmth pulsed gently, a sensation that might have been approval or might have been simple biological function. He chose to interpret it as approval. Whether that interpretation was accurate or merely comforting, he could not say.

"Thank you," he said again. "For everything."

He bowed, as he had seen Katsuhito do, and turned back toward the house. The tree watched him go—or seemed to watch, which amounted to the same thing.

Two weeks of mysteries, still unsolved. But some mysteries were meant to be lived rather than solved.

As he walked back along the path, Sheldon considered the strangeness of his situation. He had died—or at least, his previous existence had ended. He had been transported across time and space by a power he did not understand. He had been given abilities that defied normal physics, given a second chance at a life he had spent the first one largely wasting.

And instead of pursuing power, instead of seeking to understand and exploit what had been done to him, he was sweeping shrine grounds and building forts with a five-year-old.

His previous self would have been horrified. The man who had spent decades chasing academic achievement, who had measured his worth in publications and citations, who had sacrificed relationships and health and happiness in pursuit of recognition—that man would have seen this life as failure.

But that man had been wrong about many things. About what mattered, about what lasted, about what constituted success. That man had died alone in his office, surrounded by papers that no one would remember, leaving no one behind who would truly mourn his passing.

This life was different. This life was building something that would last. Not in academic journals, but in the heart of a child who was learning to trust again. In the gratitude of an old man whose burden had been lightened. In the connections forming with a village that needed what he could offer.

The warmth hummed its agreement, gentle and constant.

He had made the right choice. He knew this with certainty that his previous life had never provided.

---

Dinner was simple but satisfying.

Katsuhito had prepared a hot pot—vegetables and tofu simmering in a flavorful broth, the steam rising in fragrant clouds. The pot sat on a portable burner at the center of the table, maintaining its gentle boil throughout the meal. Cabbage and mushrooms bobbed in the liquid, releasing their flavors into the communal broth.

"This is a weekend meal," Katsuhito explained, noting Sheldon's interest in the preparation. "Too much work for regular evenings, but appropriate for days when we have time to enjoy eating together."

"The broth is excellent."

"Achika's recipe. She perfected it over many years—adjusting the proportions of dashi and soy sauce until the balance was exactly right." He added more vegetables to the pot. "I have tried to maintain her standard. Whether I succeed is a matter of opinion."

"You succeed," Tenchi said, fishing for a piece of tofu. "This is my favorite," he added, addressing Sheldon. "We only have it on special days."

"Is today a special day?"

"Every day is special now," the boy said, with the certainty of someone who had recently learned this truth. "Because of the kitten. And the fort. And because Tsukino-san is here."

"You are becoming quite the philosopher," Katsuhito observed.

"What's a philosopher?"

"Someone who thinks about the nature of things. About what makes life meaningful."

"Oh." Tenchi considered this, chopsticks poised over the pot. "Then yes, I'm a philosopher. I think about lots of things."

"What do you think about?"

"About why the sky is blue. About where cats go when they die. About whether the fish in the canal remember the wishes people throw them." He retrieved another piece of tofu, successfully this time. "About whether Mom can see me, wherever she is."

The table was quiet for a moment. The steam continued to rise, the broth continued to simmer, but the mood had shifted.

"Those are profound questions," Sheldon said.

"I don't know what profound means, but they feel important." Tenchi looked between the two adults. "Do you know the answers?"

"Some of them. The sky is blue because of how light scatters through the atmosphere—the smaller wavelengths, which appear blue, scatter more than the longer wavelengths. Cats go... wherever living things go when they die. We do not fully understand that. The fish probably do not remember wishes, but the act of wishing may still matter."

"Why would it matter if the fish don't remember?"

"Because the wish is for you, not for the fish. The act of hoping, of putting your intention into the world—that has power regardless of whether anyone else receives it."

Tenchi absorbed this, chewing thoughtfully. "That's interesting. I never thought about it that way."

"And Mom?"

Sheldon hesitated, but Katsuhito spoke first.

"I believe she can see you. I do not know how, and I cannot prove it. But I believe that love does not end with death. That the people who loved us continue to love us, even when they are no longer here to say so."

"Do you really believe that?"

"I do."

"Then I believe it too." Tenchi nodded once, firmly, the matter settled by the authority of his grandfather's faith. "Mom is watching. She sees the fort and the kitten plans and everything. She's happy that I'm happy."

"I am certain she is," Sheldon said.

They finished the meal in comfortable silence, the warmth of the pot matching the warmth of the moment. Outside, the evening was settling over the mountain, the first stars appearing in the darkening sky.

---

Bath time and bedtime followed the usual pattern.

Tenchi was tired but content, the day's activities having filled him without exhausting him. He submitted to bath time without protest, brushed his teeth without reminder, and settled into his futon with Usagi-chan and the mouse toy tucked close.

"Tsukino-san?"

"Yes?"

"Two weeks is a lot of days."

"It is."

"Do you think you'll stay for more weeks?"

"I plan to stay for many more weeks. And months. And years."

"Good." The boy's eyes were heavy, his words beginning to blur at the edges. "I want you to stay forever."

"Forever is a long time."

"I know. But I still want it." A yawn interrupted whatever else he might have said. "Goodnight, Tsukino-san. Thank you for building the fort with me."

"Goodnight, Tenchi. Thank you for letting me help."

The boy was asleep within moments, his breathing evening out, his small body relaxed into the trust of rest. Sheldon sat with him for a few minutes, as had become his habit, feeling the weight of the day settling around him.

Two weeks. Fourteen days of this new life.

And Tenchi wanted him to stay forever.

---

Later, on the engawa, Katsuhito joined him.

The old man moved slowly in the evening chill, his joints protesting the day's activities. But there was peace in his expression, the satisfaction of a day well spent.

"The calligraphy went well?" Sheldon asked.

"It went terribly. But it will go less terribly tomorrow, and less still the day after. That is the nature of practice." Katsuhito settled onto the wooden planks with a small grunt of effort. "The boy is asleep?"

"Almost immediately."

"Good. He needs rest. The week ahead will test his patience."

"The kitten."

"Yes. The wait will be difficult. Children are not naturally patient, and this is a particularly exciting thing to wait for."

They sat in silence, watching the stars emerge. The sky was clear, the Milky Way visible as a bright band across the heavens. The sounds of the forest created a gentle backdrop—crickets and frogs and the occasional call of a night bird.

"Two weeks," Sheldon said.

"You have been counting."

"It seemed significant. A milestone, of a sort."

"Milestones matter. They help us see how far we have come." Katsuhito was quiet for a moment. "Two weeks ago, you were a stranger. Now you are... something else."

"What am I now?"

"Family, I think. Or becoming family." The old man's voice was thoughtful, considered. "Family is not only blood. It is commitment, presence, care. You have demonstrated all of these."

"I have tried."

"You have succeeded. The trying is part of the success." He turned to look at Sheldon in the starlight. "I have watched you carefully these two weeks. Watched how you interact with Tenchi, how you approach your work, how you treat the people you meet. I have seen nothing that causes concern."

"I am glad."

"More than that—I have seen things that give me hope. The boy is better with you here. More grounded, more confident, less afraid. He smiles more. He talks about the future in ways he did not before."

"He is resilient. He would have recovered without me."

"Perhaps. But recovery and flourishing are different things. With you here, he is flourishing." Katsuhito let this observation settle. "For that, I am grateful."

"I am grateful too. For being accepted. For being given a place here."

"You earned your place. Acceptance must be earned." The old man's voice carried approval. "But you did earn it, and now it is yours. Whatever comes next, you will face it as part of this family."

"I have been thinking about the repair shop," Sheldon said. "About how to establish it, what services to offer."

"And?"

"I believe I should start small. Basic repairs—things the villagers currently have to travel for or do without. Mechanical items, electrical devices, household tools. Things that require skill but not specialized equipment."

"A sensible approach."

"Then, as I learn what the community needs, I can expand. Perhaps acquire more specialized tools, develop expertise in particular areas." He paused. "The Tsukino house has good space for a workshop. The upper floor has excellent light, and the main floor could serve as a reception area."

"You have given this thought."

"It is what I am meant to do here. I feel that clearly." The warmth hummed in agreement. "Not just to help this family, but to serve this village. To be useful in a way that creates value for everyone."

"That is a worthy ambition." Katsuhito's expression was thoughtful. "The village needs such a person. We have become too dependent on outside services—on traveling to larger towns for repairs that could be done locally."

"Tanaka mentioned this. That skills are being lost as the older craftsmen retire."

"It is true. And it is a loss not only of capability, but of independence. A village that cannot maintain itself is a village at risk."

The stars wheeled overhead, the same stars that had witnessed Sheldon's resurrection, that had shone on this mountain for thousands of years. They would shine for thousands more, indifferent to the small human dramas that played out beneath them.

And yet those dramas mattered. The connections between people, the care they showed each other, the families they built—these were the substance of what made life meaningful. The universe might be vast and indifferent, but the small circles of love were not.

"Tomorrow, I will contact Hashimoto," Sheldon said. "And the week will begin again."

"Yes. The week will begin again. The work will continue. The life will grow." Katsuhito rose slowly, preparing to retire. "Two weeks down. Many more to come."

"Many more to come."

The old man disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the silence and the quiet satisfaction of a milestone reached.

Two weeks. Fourteen days. The foundation was laid.

Now came the building.

The warmth hummed in his chest, gentle and constant, as the night deepened around him. He sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Tomorrow would come soon enough.

Tonight, he rested in the knowledge that he had earned his place, that he was where he belonged, that the people he loved wanted him to stay.

Two weeks down.

A lifetime to go.

⁂

## Day 15

---

## Monday, April 17, 1989

---

The third week began as the second had ended—with routine.

Sheldon woke before dawn, the pattern now established in his body without conscious effort. The warmth hummed quietly in his chest, present but undemanding. The shrine was silent around him, the mountain still wrapped in the grey light that preceded sunrise.

He rose and dressed, moving with the careful quiet of someone who had learned to navigate shared spaces without disturbing others. The floorboards were familiar now—he knew which ones creaked, which paths allowed silent passage. Small knowledge, accumulated through repetition.

In the kitchen, he prepared tea. The routine was soothing: heating water, measuring leaves, waiting for the steep. Each step required attention without demanding thought, leaving his mind free to plan the day ahead.

Today he would contact Hashimoto about the tatami. Tanaka had been clear about the urgency—the insect damage would spread if left untreated. The work needed to be scheduled soon, before the problem grew beyond manageable proportions.

He would also bring Hideo's tools to Tanaka for evaluation. The roofer had offered to examine them, to identify which could be restored and which should be replaced. It was a generous offer, one that would save Sheldon considerable time and potential mistakes.

The tea finished steeping. He poured a cup and carried it to the engawa, where the morning light was just beginning to touch the treetops. The air was cool but not cold, spring settling into its mature phase. The cherry blossoms were finished now, replaced by the bright green of new leaves.

Fifteen days. Just over two weeks. The number felt significant in a way that fourteen had not—the beginning of something new rather than the completion of something old.

He sipped his tea and waited for the household to wake.

---

Katsuhito emerged first, as usual.

The old man moved slowly in the morning, his body requiring time to remember how to function. But there was purpose in his movements today, a sense of intention that had been less pronounced in previous mornings.

"The calligraphy went poorly yesterday," he said, by way of greeting. "But I dreamed of the characters last night. My hands remember more than I thought."

"That is encouraging."

"It is unexpected. I had assumed forty years of neglect would require forty years to repair." He poured himself tea from the pot Sheldon had prepared. "Perhaps some skills leave deeper marks than others."

"Muscle memory. The patterns are encoded differently than conscious knowledge."

"Yes. Achika explained this to me once, though she used different words." He settled onto the engawa beside Sheldon, moving with care. "She said the brush becomes part of the hand, and the hand never forgets what it has truly learned."

They sat in companionable silence, watching the light strengthen. The sounds of the mountain filled the space between them—birdsong, wind in the leaves, the distant call of a deer.

"Today I contact Hashimoto," Sheldon said.

"Good. The tatami cannot wait much longer." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "Hashimoto is thorough but slow. You may need to be patient with his schedule."

"I understand."

"He is also particular about his work. He will want to assess the damage himself before committing to a timeline. Be prepared for him to insist on a site visit."

"That seems reasonable."

"It is. But it adds time to the process. Do not expect quick answers." The old man's expression carried something that might have been amusement. "Traditional craftsmen operate on traditional schedules. The urgency of others rarely influences their pace."

"I am learning this."

"You are adapting well. Many outsiders find the rhythm frustrating."

"I find it... educational. There is wisdom in refusing to rush."

Katsuhito nodded, apparently satisfied with this response. "Tanaka mentioned you would bring Hideo's tools for examination."

"Today, if possible. He offered to assess which could be restored."

"That was generous of him. Tanaka does not offer such things lightly." A pause. "He was fond of Hideo. They worked together many times over the years. I think examining the tools will be meaningful for him as well."

"I had not considered that."

"Most people do not. They see transactions where relationships exist." The old man finished his tea and set down the cup. "I will wake Tenchi. The bus will not wait for philosophical discussions."

---

Tenchi was difficult to rouse.

The excitement of the previous weeks had taken its toll, and his body demanded rest. He emerged from his futon reluctantly, eyes heavy, movements slow and uncoordinated.

"Is it really Monday?" he asked, the question suggesting hope that it might not be.

"It is really Monday."

"Already?" He rubbed his face with both hands. "The weekend went too fast."

"Weekends often do. It is one of their less pleasant qualities."

Tenchi stumbled through his morning routine with minimal enthusiasm. Breakfast was consumed without conversation, teeth were brushed without reminder but also without energy, clothes were donned with the mechanical precision of someone operating on autopilot.

"The kitten comes this week," Sheldon offered, attempting to improve the mood.

This worked. Tenchi's eyes brightened slightly, some animation returning to his features. "Wednesday or Thursday. Yamamoto-san said she would tell us today."

"That is something to look forward to."

"It's the best thing." A yawn interrupted the declaration. "I'm going to be the best cat owner ever. I've been practicing."

"Practicing how?"

"In my head. I imagine feeding him and playing with him and making sure he's happy." Tenchi finished his breakfast and pushed back from the table. "That's practice, right? Thinking about how to do things?"

"Mental rehearsal is a recognized form of practice, yes. Athletes use it to improve performance."

"See? I'm like an athlete. A cat-owning athlete."

"The comparison is... creative."

Tenchi managed a small smile, the first genuine expression of the morning. "Grandpa said he would come see the fort today. After school. You'll come too, right?"

"If you want me there."

"I want you there. It's our fort. I want to show both of you."

"Then I will be there."

The bus horn sounded in the distance—the warning that preceded arrival by several minutes. Tenchi gathered his school bag, checked for forgotten items, and headed for the door with the resigned determination of someone facing an unavoidable obligation.

"Have a good day at school," Sheldon said.

"I'll try. But Monday is the worst day for good days." He paused at the door. "Don't forget to ask about the kitten. When Yamamoto-san confirms."

"I will not forget."

Tenchi nodded once, apparently satisfied, and disappeared down the path. Moments later, the bus rumbled past, carrying him toward another day of learning and socialization and all the other experiences that shaped young minds.

The shrine was quiet again.

---

Shrine work filled the morning.

Sheldon swept the paths with practiced efficiency, the movements now automatic. The cherry blossom petals were nearly gone—only a few stragglers remained, clinging to corners where the wind had deposited them. Soon there would be nothing left of the spring display but memory and anticipation of next year.

The water basins required attention. Overnight, leaves had fallen into several of them, and one had developed a slight algae bloom that needed scrubbing. The work was meditative, requiring attention without demanding thought.

The frog was present, as it often was.

"Good morning," Sheldon said.

The frog blinked.

"You are becoming predictable. I expected to find you here."

Another blink. The frog's throat pulsed gently, the only sign of any internal activity.

"I am going to give you a name. It seems appropriate, given our ongoing acquaintance." Sheldon considered options while cleaning around the small green observer. "Kaeru would be too obvious. Naming a frog 'Frog' lacks creativity."

The frog offered no opinion on this matter.

"Perhaps Midori. You are green, after all."

Still no response. The frog seemed content to let Sheldon work through the naming process without input.

"Or Ishikawa. After the haiku poet who wrote about frogs." Sheldon finished cleaning the basin and stepped back to assess his work. "Though that might be presumptuous. You have not demonstrated any poetic inclinations."

The frog hopped into the fresh water and settled onto its favorite rock.

"Ishikawa it is, until you object."

Ishikawa did not object. The name, like the frog itself, simply existed—part of the shrine's collection of small presences that gave the place its character.

---

Mid-morning, Sheldon walked to the village.

The path was familiar now, each curve and slope anticipated before it appeared. He had walked this route dozens of times in two weeks, and his feet knew the way without conscious guidance. The forest sounds were companionable—birds calling, leaves rustling, the occasional small creature moving through the underbrush.

Hashimoto's shop was located near the center of the village, in a building that had clearly been standing for generations. The sign above the door was weathered but legible, the characters announcing the presence of a tatami craftsman within.

Sheldon entered and found himself in a small reception area that smelled of rush grass and aged wood. Samples of tatami work lined the walls—different weaves, different border fabrics, different levels of wear that demonstrated the material's progression over time.

A bell on the door had announced his arrival, and after a moment, a man emerged from the back room. He was older than Tanaka but younger than Katsuhito, with hands that bore the calluses of decades of precise work.

"Hashimoto-san," Sheldon said, bowing appropriately. "I am Tsukino Sheldon. We have not met, but Tanaka-san recommended I contact you regarding tatami repair."

"Ah, the new resident at the shrine." Hashimoto's expression was measuring but not unfriendly. "Tanaka mentioned you. He said you are restoring the old Tsukino house."

"That is correct. He completed the roof work last week and noted significant insect damage to the tatami. He suggested I contact you urgently."

"Insect damage." Hashimoto's expression shifted to something more serious. "What kind of insects?"

"He did not specify. He mentioned that the damage was visible in several rooms, with the worst in what appeared to be the main living area."

"I will need to see it myself. Insect damage varies greatly in severity and treatment. Some can be addressed with replacement of individual mats. Others require more extensive intervention."

"I understand. When might you be available to visit?"

Hashimoto considered this, his eyes distant as he consulted some internal schedule. "Tomorrow afternoon. After the lunch hour. Will that be acceptable?"

"That will be fine. Thank you."

"Do not thank me yet. I have not agreed to take the work." His tone was matter-of-fact rather than hostile. "I will assess the damage and determine whether it falls within my capabilities. Some situations require specialists I would need to coordinate with."

"I appreciate your thoroughness."

"Thoroughness is the minimum standard for good work." Hashimoto's expression softened slightly. "Tanaka speaks well of you. He says you are respectful of traditional methods and willing to learn."

"I try to be."

"That is increasingly rare. Many young people want quick solutions, modern materials, shortcuts that sacrifice quality for speed." He shook his head slowly. "They do not understand that some things cannot be rushed. That haste creates problems that patience would have prevented."

"I am learning this. The craftsmen I have met have been generous teachers."

"We have much to teach, and few students interested in learning." Hashimoto moved toward a shelf of materials, selecting several samples. "While you are here, let me show you the options for tatami replacement. Understanding what is possible will help when we discuss the restoration plan."

He spent the next twenty minutes explaining the differences between various grades of rush grass, the significance of different border fabrics, the traditional patterns and their meanings. The rush grass came from specific regions, Hashimoto explained, and the best quality was reserved for formal rooms—tokonoma alcoves and spaces where honored guests would be received.

"The weave matters as much as the material," he said, holding up two samples that looked nearly identical to Sheldon's untrained eye. "This one is tighter, see? More rushes per inch. It will last longer, feel firmer underfoot, develop a better patina over time."

"The price difference?"

"Significant. But the value difference is greater still. A tatami made with inferior materials might last fifteen years. One made properly will last forty, perhaps fifty, with appropriate care." Hashimoto set down the samples. "The initial cost is higher, but the cost per year of service is lower. This is the calculation traditional craftsmen understand—quality repays itself many times over."

"That philosophy applies beyond tatami."

"It applies to everything worth making. Furniture, buildings, relationships." He gave Sheldon a sharp look. "You understand this already. I can see it in how you listen."

"I am learning it. The craftsmen I have met have been patient teachers."

"Patience is required. These truths cannot be transmitted quickly. They must be absorbed over time, confirmed through experience." Hashimoto moved to another display. "Let me show you the border fabrics. These are often overlooked, but they frame the tatami as surely as a frame defines a painting."

The fabrics ranged from simple cotton to elaborate silk brocades. Each had its appropriate context—plain borders for everyday rooms, decorated ones for formal spaces, specific patterns that carried meanings Sheldon would need years to fully understand.

"You see this pattern? The interlocking circles?" Hashimoto traced the design with one finger. "This represents eternal continuity. It is often used in rooms where marriages are celebrated, where generations gather. The pattern speaks of connection across time."

Sheldon listened carefully, asking questions when appropriate, demonstrating the genuine interest that seemed to matter to these craftsmen.

"You pay attention," Hashimoto observed, when the explanation concluded. "That is also rare."

"What you know is valuable. It would be disrespectful not to attend to it."

"Hmm." The craftsman's expression carried something that might have been approval. "Tomorrow afternoon, then. I will examine the house and we will discuss what is needed."

"I will be there. Thank you for your time."

Sheldon bowed and departed, another relationship established, another step toward the house's restoration.

---

The walk to Tanaka's workshop took fifteen minutes.

The roofer's building was easier to identify than Hashimoto's—stacks of tiles and wooden scaffolding marked it from a distance. The sounds of work emerged as Sheldon approached: the rhythmic tap of a hammer, the scrape of materials being moved.

Tanaka was on the roof of a small outbuilding, replacing tiles with the efficient movements of long practice. He noticed Sheldon's approach and raised a hand in greeting.

"You brought the tools?"

"I did." Sheldon held up the cloth-wrapped bundle. "As you suggested."

"Good. Let me finish this section and I will come down." The roofer returned to his work, completing a row of tiles with precise, unhurried movements. Then he descended the ladder with the casual confidence of someone who had made the climb thousands of times.

"Inside," he said, gesturing toward the workshop door. "Better light for examination."

The interior of the workshop was organized chaos—materials and tools arranged in patterns that clearly made sense to Tanaka but appeared random to an outside observer. A large workbench dominated the center of the space, its surface scarred by decades of use. Shelves lined the walls, holding supplies sorted by type and size. The smell of wood and metal oil permeated everything.

"The light here is best in the morning," Tanaka said, noticing Sheldon's gaze moving around the space. "But afternoon works well enough for examination. Put them here."

Sheldon set the bundle on the bench and unwrapped it carefully. Hideo's tools emerged into the light: planes and chisels and saws, the accumulated equipment of a craftsman's working life. Each piece bore the marks of use—worn handles, polished surfaces, the patina that came from years of service.

Tanaka's expression changed as he saw them. Something passed across his features—recognition, perhaps, or memory. He reached out and touched one of the planes with unexpected gentleness.

"I remember this one. Hideo bought it the year his daughter was born. He said he needed something new to celebrate." The roofer's voice was quieter than usual. "That was... forty years ago, perhaps more. Kiyone was just a baby then. We joked that she would learn to use tools before she learned to walk."

"Did she?"

"No. She was more interested in books, in learning, in things beyond the village." A pause. "But she respected the crafts. She understood what her father's work meant. She brought Tenchi to watch him sometimes, before..."

Before she died. The words hung unspoken in the air.

"Hideo stopped working after she was gone," Tanaka continued. "Lost the will for it. Said his hands remembered her too clearly when he held his tools." He picked up the plane and examined it closely, testing the blade's edge with his thumb. "He kept his tools well. This is still serviceable with proper sharpening."

He moved through the collection systematically, examining each tool with practiced expertise. Some he set aside with approving nods. Others he placed in a separate pile, shaking his head slightly.

"These can be restored," he said, indicating the larger group. "Good steel, good construction. They need cleaning and sharpening, some minor repairs, but the core quality is there."

"And the others?"

"Beyond practical restoration. The wood has cracked in ways that compromise function, or the steel has warped past correction." He held up a chisel with a visibly bent blade. "This one... I remember when this happened. Hideo was angry with himself for months. He had been careless, struck at the wrong angle, and ruined a tool his father had given him."

"That must have been difficult."

"It was. But he kept it anyway. Said it reminded him to be more careful." Tanaka set the chisel aside with something like reverence. "You could keep these damaged ones as well. Not for use, but for memory."

"I will. Thank you."

"For the serviceable ones—" Tanaka began sorting them into categories. "These need only sharpening. These need handle repair. These need more extensive work." He paused, looking at Sheldon directly. "I could do this restoration, if you wish. It would honor Hideo's memory to see his tools returned to service."

"I would be grateful for that."

"Then we will do it together. I will show you the techniques, and you will do the work under my guidance. That way, you will understand these tools as their owner understood them."

"That is... very generous."

"It is practical. You will need to maintain them yourself going forward. Better to learn properly from the start." Tanaka began wrapping the tools back in their cloth. "Come back Friday afternoon. We will begin with the sharpening."

"I will be here."

"Good." The roofer handed the bundle back to Sheldon. "Hideo would have approved of you, I think. He valued people who took care with their work."

"I hope to be worthy of that approval."

"You are progressing toward it."

---

The walk back to the shrine was contemplative.

Sheldon carried the tools—some destined for restoration, some for memory—and thought about the connections between people and objects. These tools had been extensions of Hideo's hands, instruments through which his skill and care had manifested. They carried something of him, even now.

The path wound through the village, past houses where families were beginning their afternoon routines. Children were returning from school, their voices carrying through open windows. Women were starting dinner preparations, the smells of cooking beginning to drift through the streets.

This was the life of the village—not the work of the craftsmen alone, but the whole fabric of daily existence. The cooking and cleaning, the children playing, the elderly tending gardens, the thousand small activities that made a community function. Everything connected to everything else.

Sheldon thought about how he fit into this fabric. An outsider, still, in some ways—his face marked him as foreign, his background remained mysterious, his presence was still novel enough to draw attention. But less of an outsider than he had been two weeks ago. The relationships he was building, the work he was doing, the trust he was earning—all of it wove him more tightly into the community's pattern.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, as though acknowledging the significance of what he carried. The power that had brought him here seemed to understand the importance of such things—the way objects could hold meaning beyond their material function, the way communities could absorb newcomers who proved themselves worthy.

He thought about the repair shop he intended to establish. It would be more than a business, more than a service to the village. It would be a way of continuing what craftsmen like Hideo had begun—the work of maintenance and restoration that kept the material world functional. Every broken radio he fixed, every worn tool he restored, every piece of furniture he mended—all of it would contribute to the village's resilience.

Objects mattered. The things people made, the tools they used, the items that filled their homes and lives—these were not separate from the people themselves. Caring for objects was a way of caring for people, of honoring the labor and intention that had created them.

His grandmother had understood this. She had kept things carefully, repaired them rather than replacing them, treated her possessions with the respect due to objects that had earned their place through service. "Everything in this house has a story," she would say. "And stories deserve to be continued."

The shrine came into view through the trees. Home, now. The place where he belonged.

---

Lunch was simple: rice, pickled vegetables, miso soup.

Katsuhito ate with his usual measured pace, each movement precise and unhurried. The calligraphy practice seemed to have affected his general demeanor—there was a quality of attention to his actions that Sheldon had not noticed before.

"Hashimoto will visit tomorrow afternoon," Sheldon reported. "He wishes to assess the tatami damage personally before committing to a timeline."

"As expected. He has always been thorough."

"He spent twenty minutes explaining the different grades of tatami and their appropriate uses. It was... educational."

"Hashimoto enjoys teaching. It is how he validates his expertise—by transmitting it to others." Katsuhito sipped his soup. "Most traditional craftsmen share this quality. Knowledge that dies with its holder is knowledge wasted."

"Tanaka offered to teach me tool restoration. He will guide me through the process of restoring Hideo's tools."

"That is significant. Tanaka does not offer such things casually." The old man's expression carried approval. "You are building relationships with these people. They are accepting you into their networks of knowledge and obligation."

"I am trying to be worthy of their acceptance."

"You are succeeding. The evidence is in their offers." Katsuhito finished his soup and set down the bowl. "This afternoon, we visit the fort with Tenchi."

"I remember. He was very eager this morning."

"He has been anticipating this for days. The fort represents his achievement—proof of what he can accomplish with effort and guidance." A pause. "You should understand what this means to him. It is not merely a structure. It is validation."

"I understand."

"Good. Then you will respond appropriately when he shows us."

---

The afternoon passed in quiet activity.

Sheldon continued his study of the carpentry book, the information now connecting to practical experience in ways that enhanced both. The section on tool maintenance was particularly relevant given Tanaka's offer—understanding the theory would make the hands-on learning more effective.

Katsuhito practiced his calligraphy in the main hall. The sounds of brush on paper created a gentle rhythm, punctuated by longer silences when he assessed his work. Occasionally, a soft sound of frustration would emerge, followed by renewed effort.

The shrine was peaceful in the afternoon light. This, Sheldon realized, was what contentment felt like—not the absence of challenge, but the presence of meaningful work and valuable relationships. The things he was building here would last. The connections he was forming would endure.

The warmth hummed its agreement.

Around three o'clock, the bus returned Tenchi to the mountain's base. Sheldon heard the horn in the distance, marking the boy's arrival. Minutes later, small feet came running up the path, faster than usual.

"Is Grandpa ready? Are we going? Can we go now?"

"Your grandfather is practicing calligraphy. We should let him finish."

"But—" Tenchi's eagerness was visible in every line of his body, in the way he bounced on his feet while trying to stand still. "Okay. But soon, right?"

"Soon."

The wait was difficult for him. He sat on the engawa, then stood, then sat again. He arranged and rearranged his school bag. He checked the time by the sun's position, which told him nothing useful but gave him something to do.

Finally, Katsuhito emerged from the main hall. His fingers bore fresh ink stains, and his expression carried the particular satisfaction of practice completed.

"You are ready to show us this fort?"

"Yes! It's really good, Grandpa. Tsukino-san helped me build it but I did a lot of the work myself."

"Then let us see what you have accomplished."

---

The walk to the clearing took fifteen minutes.

Tenchi led the way, his excitement making him faster than usual. He kept looking back to ensure the adults were following, as though worried they might change their minds about the expedition.

"It's through here. Past the big rock. See? That's the marker stone. I know exactly where it is."

"You have learned navigation," Katsuhito observed.

"Tsukino-san taught me. Landmarks and paths and how to not get lost." Tenchi ducked under a low branch with the ease of someone who had made this journey many times. "We're almost there. You can see the roof from—there! See it?"

The fort came into view through the trees. In the afternoon light, it looked genuinely impressive—a small but solid structure, walls complete, roof partially covered, space inside for shelter and secrets.

Tenchi ran ahead, positioning himself at the entrance like a guide welcoming visitors to a important site.

"This is the entrance. You have to duck because it's made for kids, but adults can fit if they're careful." He demonstrated the proper technique. "The walls keep out wind and the roof keeps out rain. Well, mostly. We're still working on the roof."

Katsuhito approached slowly, examining the structure with careful attention. He touched one of the wall supports, testing its stability. He peered at the lashing that held the branches together. His movements were those of someone who knew how to evaluate construction—methodical, thorough, informed by experience.

"Who taught you this technique?"

"Tsukino-san. He said it's the same way old buildings are made, with rope and sticks instead of nails."

"Traditional lashing." The old man's expression carried something Sheldon could not quite read. "This is done properly. The rope tightens under stress rather than loosening."

"Is that good?"

"That is very good. It is how my grandfather taught me, when I was not much older than you." Katsuhito examined another section of the wall, his fingers tracing the pattern of the lashing. "He was a stern teacher. He would make me redo work until it met his standards. I resented it at the time. Now I understand he was giving me a gift."

"What gift?"

"The gift of competence. Of knowing that what I build will last. Of being able to trust my own work." The old man straightened. "This fort will stand for years if you maintain it. The foundation is sound, the joints are secure. You have built something real."

Tenchi beamed. The validation from his grandfather was clearly the response he had hoped for.

"Come inside. There's room for everyone. Well, maybe not everyone at once, but definitely two people at once. Three if they're small."

Sheldon watched as Katsuhito carefully navigated the entrance, his old joints protesting the required maneuvering. But the old man made no complaint, accepting the discomfort as the price of participating in his grandson's moment of pride.

Inside, the two of them sat together—the very old and the very young, connected by blood and love and the shelter of a structure built by small hands with gentle guidance.

"I can see why you like it here," Katsuhito said, looking around at the woven walls, the filtered light. "It is a good place for thinking."

"That's what it's for. Thinking and reading and talking to Mom sometimes." Tenchi's voice dropped slightly. "I told her about the kitten. I think she'd be happy."

"I am certain she is happy."

They sat in silence for a moment, grandfather and grandson, sharing the space that Tenchi had created for exactly these kinds of moments.

"You have done well," Katsuhito said finally. "This is real work. Useful work. Something to be proud of."

"Tsukino-san helped."

"Tsukino-san guided. But the work is yours." The old man placed a hand on Tenchi's shoulder. "Your mother would be proud of you. I am proud of you."

Tenchi's eyes glistened. The words he had needed, delivered in the place he had made, by the person whose opinion mattered most.

Sheldon remained outside, giving them the privacy of the moment. Some things were meant to be shared between family alone.

---

The walk back to the shrine was quieter.

Tenchi had used up his excited energy and settled into something calmer—contentment rather than anticipation. He walked between the two adults, occasionally reaching up to take a hand on either side.

"Thank you for coming," he said. "Both of you."

"Thank you for inviting us," Sheldon replied.

"You built it. I just helped."

"We built it together. That's what makes it special." Tenchi squeezed both hands simultaneously. "Everything is better when you do it with people you..."

He trailed off, but the unfinished sentence hung in the air, completing itself in the silence.

People you love.

---

Yamamoto-san called after dinner.

The phone rang in the main room—an old rotary model that Sheldon had come to associate with news, both good and otherwise. Katsuhito rose to answer it, his movements suggesting no particular expectation about the call's content.

Sheldon and Tenchi remained at the kitchen table, the boy's posture tense with anticipation. They had known the call might come today—Yamamoto-san had promised to confirm the kitten's readiness—but anticipation and certainty were different things.

Through the wall, they could hear Katsuhito's voice—brief responses, formal acknowledgments, the rhythm of Japanese telephone etiquette. Nothing in his tone revealed the call's substance.

When he returned to the kitchen where Sheldon and Tenchi waited, his expression gave nothing away. This was deliberate, Sheldon suspected—the old man taking quiet pleasure in extending the moment of suspense.

"The kitten," Tenchi said, unable to wait. "When?"

"Wednesday. Yamamoto-san believes he will be ready by Wednesday afternoon." Katsuhito's expression softened slightly. "She says he has been eating well, playing actively, and sleeping in the spot where you held him. She believes he remembers you."

"He remembers me?" Tenchi's eyes widened. "Already?"

"Cats form attachments quickly when the connection is genuine. She said he perks up when people visit, as though expecting someone specific."

"Me. He's expecting me."

"That is her interpretation, yes."

"Two days!" Tenchi's restraint evaporated in an instant. "Only two more days!"

"Two days. You will need to prepare the mudroom. The litter box must be positioned, the food and water dishes set out, the sleeping area arranged."

"I can do that. I can do that tomorrow. Can I do it tomorrow?"

"You may begin preparations tomorrow after school. But do not rush—doing things correctly is more important than doing them quickly."

"I'll do it correctly. I'll do it perfectly. He's going to have the best mudroom any kitten ever had."

The excitement was contagious. Even Katsuhito's stern expression softened into something like amusement.

"Two days," Tenchi repeated, as though confirming it to himself. "Two days, and then I'll have a kitten."

"You will have a responsibility," Katsuhito corrected. "A living creature that depends on you for its wellbeing."

"I know. That's even better than just having a pet." Tenchi's eyes were bright. "He'll depend on me. Like I depend on you and Tsukino-san. That's what family means, right? Depending on each other?"

The question hit harder than Tenchi could have intended. The simple truth of a child's understanding, cutting through all the complications adults created.

"Yes," Sheldon said. "That is exactly what family means."

---

Bath time and bedtime followed the usual pattern.

Tenchi was too excited to sleep easily, his mind racing with plans and anticipations. Sheldon sat with him longer than usual, providing the calm presence that sometimes helped settle overactive thoughts.

"What if he doesn't like me?" Tenchi asked, the worry surfacing as the excitement faded.

"He already likes you. He chose you, remember? He sat in your lap and purred."

"But that was just once. What if he changes his mind?"

"Cats do not change their minds about people easily. Once they decide you are their person, they are quite loyal."

"Really?"

"Really. Your grandfather told you about Kiyone's cat Shinji. He waited for her every day. That is how cats love—steadily, reliably, without wavering."

Tenchi considered this. "I want to love him like that too. Steadily."

"Then you will. Love is a choice we make every day, through small actions rather than grand gestures."

"Like feeding him and playing with him and making sure he's safe?"

"Exactly like that."

"Okay." The boy's eyes were heavy now, the excitement finally releasing its grip. "Two more days."

"Two more days."

"Goodnight, Tsukino-san."

"Goodnight, Tenchi. Dream of kittens."

A small smile crossed the boy's face as sleep claimed him. His dreams, Sheldon suspected, would be exactly as suggested.

---

On the engawa, Katsuhito was waiting.

"The fort impressed you," Sheldon said.

"The technique impressed me. The lashing is not something commonly known. You taught him well."

"I taught him what seemed appropriate for the construction we were attempting."

"Where did you learn it?"

The question was casual, but something in Katsuhito's tone suggested genuine curiosity. Sheldon considered how to answer.

"Books, partly. Observation, partly. The techniques used in traditional Japanese construction are well-documented." He paused. "And some of it seemed... intuitive. As though my hands knew what to do before my mind understood why."

"Intuition." Katsuhito's expression was unreadable in the evening light. "That is an interesting word for it."

"What word would you use?"

"I am not certain." The old man was quiet for a long moment. "There are things about you that do not quite fit the expected pattern. Skills that seem too natural, knowledge that appears from nowhere, a presence that suggests more than it reveals."

Sheldon's heart rate increased slightly. This was the closest Katsuhito had come to directly addressing the strangeness that Sheldon carried.

"I do not mean this as accusation," the old man continued. "You have proven your character through your actions. Whatever mysteries you carry, they have not led you toward harm."

"I appreciate your trust."

"Trust is earned through behavior, not explanation. You have earned what you have received." Katsuhito rose slowly, preparing to retire. "But I am observant. And I have lived long enough to recognize when someone is more than they appear."

"And this does not concern you?"

"It concerns me less than it interests me." A slight smile touched the old man's features. "We all have secrets, Tsukino-san. The worthy ones carry theirs with grace and use them for good. You seem to be doing both."

"What would you do if you discovered my secrets were... larger than you expected?"

The question surprised Sheldon even as he asked it. He had not planned to push this conversation, but something in the evening's intimacy invited honesty.

Katsuhito considered the question with the seriousness it deserved. "That would depend on what the secrets were. But I suspect..." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "I suspect that whatever you carry, it is not something that threatens this family. A person who intends harm does not build forts with children or spend hours learning traditional crafts from old men. A person who means to deceive does not show his character through a thousand small kindnesses."

"That is generous reasoning."

"It is practical reasoning. I have lived long enough to recognize patterns. Your pattern is clear, even if its source is not." The old man rose slowly, preparing to retire. "Whatever mystery brought you here, Tsukino-san, it brought someone good. I choose to be grateful for that rather than suspicious of the method."

He disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the implications of what had been said.

Katsuhito knew. Not the specifics, perhaps—the resurrection, the warmth, the power that hummed beneath Sheldon's skin. But he knew that something was different. That Sheldon was not entirely what he claimed to be.

And he had accepted this. Had chosen to trust based on actions rather than demanding explanations. Had articulated his reasoning clearly and without evasion.

It was, Sheldon realized, exactly how he would have wanted to be treated. Judged by what he did rather than what he was. Given room to prove himself through behavior rather than forced to reveal truths that might be impossible to explain.

The warmth pulsed gently, as though acknowledging the significance of the moment.

Fifteen days. Two weeks and a day. And Katsuhito had seen through the surface to something beneath—and had decided it did not matter.

Tomorrow, Hashimoto would examine the tatami. Wednesday, the kitten would arrive. The days continued, each one building on the last, creating a life from accumulated moments.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Progress was being made. Trust was being earned. The foundation was solid and growing stronger.

Whatever came next, he would face it as part of this family.

That was everything.

⁂

## Day 16

---

## Tuesday, April 18, 1989

---

One day.

Sheldon woke with this knowledge already present in his mind, as though it had been waiting for consciousness to acknowledge it. Tomorrow, the kitten would arrive. Tomorrow, Tenchi would have something small and warm and dependent to love.

The anticipation was not his own, not exactly—but proximity to Tenchi's excitement had made it contagious. The household hummed with awareness of the approaching change, the way a family might hum before a birth or a homecoming.

He rose and prepared for the day, his movements efficient from repetition. The warmth in his chest was quiet this morning, present but undemanding. Whatever power it represented seemed content to observe rather than influence.

Today, Hashimoto would visit the Tsukino house to assess the tatami damage. Today, the restoration would take another step forward. Today, the ordinary work of building a life would continue.

And tomorrow, everything would be different.

---

Breakfast was charged with barely contained excitement.

Tenchi sat at his usual place, but nothing about his posture was usual. He vibrated with anticipation, his chopsticks moving through the motions of eating while his mind was clearly elsewhere.

"Tomorrow," he said, for perhaps the fifth time since waking. "Tomorrow he comes home."

"Tomorrow afternoon," Katsuhito corrected, with the patient precision of someone who had made this correction several times already. "You will be at school when he arrives. We will collect him after you return."

"Can't I stay home? Just tomorrow? So I can be there when he comes?"

"School is not optional for kitten arrivals. You will see him soon enough."

Tenchi's expression suggested he found this timeline unacceptable, but he had learned that arguing with his grandfather on matters of school attendance was futile. He returned to his breakfast with something less than enthusiasm.

"Today you may prepare the mudroom," Katsuhito continued. "After school. The litter box must be positioned, the food and water dishes arranged, the sleeping area prepared."

"I already know where everything goes. I planned it."

"Planning and execution are different skills. Today you will execute."

"Okay." Some of the frustration lifted from Tenchi's face. At least he would be doing something, taking action rather than merely waiting. "Can Tsukino-san help me?"

"Tsukino-san has an appointment this afternoon. Hashimoto-san is coming to examine the tatami at the house."

"Oh." Tenchi's expression shifted to something more complex—disappointment mixed with understanding. "That's important too. For Tsukino-san's house."

"It is. We can assist each other in different ways. You will prepare for your kitten; he will prepare for his future home."

"Parallel preparation," Tenchi said, testing the phrase. "We're both getting ready for something new."

"That is an insightful observation."

The boy smiled, pleased to have earned approval through his words. He finished his breakfast with renewed purpose, the parallel between his preparations and Sheldon's seeming to make both more meaningful.

---

The morning's shrine work was routine.

Sheldon swept the paths, noting how the task had become meditative rather than effortful. His body knew the movements now, the rhythm of the broom, the patterns of debris that accumulated in predictable locations. His mind was free to wander while his hands did their work.

The spring morning was gentle around him. New leaves had fully replaced the cherry blossoms now, the trees dressed in bright green that seemed to glow when sunlight touched it. Birds moved through the branches, their calls creating a layered soundtrack that changed with the time of day. The mountain was fully awake, fully alive, celebrating the season of growth.

He thought about the house. About what Hashimoto might find when he examined the tatami, what the repair would cost, how long it would take. The roof was complete, the structure sound. But a house needed more than walls and ceiling—it needed the soft elements that made a space habitable, the tatami and the fusuma and the fixtures that transformed a building into a home.

The sweeping led him past the great tree, as it always did. He paused there, as had become his habit, standing in its presence for a moment of silent acknowledgment. The shimenawa rope swayed gently in the morning breeze, the paper streamers rustling with sounds that might have been words in a language he did not speak.

The warmth in his chest stirred slightly, responding to the tree's proximity. Two presences aware of each other, connected by something neither fully understood.

"Good morning," Sheldon said quietly.

The tree did not respond. But something in the way the light fell through its leaves seemed like acknowledgment.

He continued his sweep, moving toward the water basins.

The frog was present, as expected.

"Good morning, Ishikawa."

The frog blinked, apparently accepting the name without objection. Its green skin caught the light, mottled patterns that would have provided excellent camouflage in the forest but served no purpose on the grey stone basin.

"Tomorrow brings change to the household. A new small creature to share our space." Sheldon changed the water with practiced movements, careful not to disturb his small observer. "I suspect you and the kitten will never meet. Your domains do not overlap. But you are both part of the shrine's collection of lives now."

Ishikawa offered no comment on this observation. The frog hopped into the fresh water and settled onto its preferred rock with the satisfaction of a creature whose needs were simple and regularly met.

"Tenchi is very excited. He has prepared a space, considered the kitten's needs, thought about how to make him feel welcome." Sheldon paused, struck by a thought. "Perhaps that is what you felt, when you first arrived at this basin. Perhaps someone made it welcoming for you, and you decided to stay."

The frog's throat pulsed gently, the only acknowledgment it seemed inclined to provide.

"Your contentment is admirable," Sheldon said. "You have achieved what philosophers seek—the alignment of desire and circumstance. You want water and sun and insects, and you have water and sun and insects. Your life is complete."

He stepped back, examining his work. The basin was clean, the water fresh, the small guardian undisturbed.

"I am learning from you, Ishikawa. To want what I have rather than only having what I want."

The frog blinked once, then closed its eyes, apparently considering the morning's philosophical exchange complete.

---

Mid-morning, Sheldon walked to the village to meet Hashimoto.

They had agreed to meet at the craftsman's shop, then walk together to the Tsukino house. This gave Hashimoto the opportunity to bring any equipment he might need for his assessment, and gave Sheldon the opportunity to observe how a master approached a new project.

The tatami shop was quiet when Sheldon arrived. Hashimoto emerged from the back room carrying a small bag of tools—probes and lights and measuring implements, the equipment of diagnosis.

"You are punctual," the craftsman observed. "That is appreciated."

"You are giving me your time. It would be disrespectful to waste any of it."

"Hmm." The sound carried approval. "Let us see what we are dealing with."

They walked together through the village, Hashimoto setting a pace that was deliberate but not slow. He asked questions as they walked—about the house's history, its previous occupants, its period of vacancy.

"Three years empty is concerning," he said, when Sheldon explained the timeline. "Insects thrive in unoccupied spaces. There is no one to notice early signs, no regular maintenance to catch problems before they spread."

"Tanaka-san seemed concerned as well. He mentioned the damage during his roof inspection."

"Tanaka has good instincts. If he flagged it, there is reason for attention."

The house came into view—the Tsukino house that would eventually become Sheldon's home. The new roof tiles gleamed in the spring sunlight, evidence of recent work. But beneath that repaired exterior, problems waited.

Hashimoto paused at the threshold, surveying the building with practiced eyes. "Good bones," he said. "The structure is sound. Tanaka's work is clean." He turned to Sheldon. "Let us see what lies beneath the surface."

---

The assessment was thorough.

Hashimoto moved through the house systematically, examining each tatami mat with careful attention. He pressed on surfaces to test their resilience, looked for discoloration that might indicate water damage or insect activity, checked the edges where mats met walls for signs of deterioration.

His tools were specialized, Sheldon noted. Thin metal probes for testing mat density. A small flashlight for examining dark corners. A magnifying lens for close inspection of suspicious areas. Each instrument served a specific purpose, selected from years of experience with similar problems.

"Here," he said, in what had been the main living room. He knelt and pressed a probe into the mat's surface. "You see this? The resistance is wrong. The straw beneath is compromised."

"Insects?"

"Almost certainly. The pattern is characteristic." Hashimoto withdrew the probe and showed Sheldon the tip. "See the dust that clings here? This is frass—insect waste. It indicates activity within the mat's interior."

"How do they enter?"

"Usually through small gaps at the edges. Or they may already be present in the straw when the mat is made, if the materials are not properly treated." He moved to another spot, tested again. "And here. The infestation has spread through at least half of this room."

Sheldon watched as the craftsman continued his examination, noting how he worked—methodical, patient, thorough. This was how expertise manifested, through attention to details that untrained eyes would miss. The experience of decades condensed into subtle observations and confident assessments.

"The adjacent room is less affected," Hashimoto said, moving through the house. "Perhaps twenty percent damage. The insects have not fully established themselves here yet." He tested several more spots. "This smaller room—" He paused, tested carefully. "Minimal. We may be able to preserve these mats with treatment rather than replacement."

"What treatment?"

"Heat, primarily. Insects cannot survive certain temperatures. We expose the mats to controlled heat that kills the infestation without damaging the materials." He moved to the final room. "It is less effective for severe damage, but for early-stage infestation, it saves the original work."

"And the mats that cannot be saved?"

"They must be removed entirely. The straw is too compromised to support restoration. We make new mats—the same dimensions, the same quality, but fresh materials throughout." Hashimoto completed his circuit of the house and returned to the main room. "I should examine the floor beneath the worst damage. Sometimes the insects spread to the underlying structure."

He carefully lifted the edge of the most affected mat, revealing the wooden floor beneath. His flashlight played across the surface as he examined the wood for signs of secondary damage.

"Good news," he said after a moment. "The floor is sound. The insects remained in the tatami. This makes our work significantly easier."

"What is the full scope?"

"Six mats require complete replacement. The main living area. Three more need significant repair—removing the damaged sections, treating the remaining material, patching with new straw." He rose from his examination and brushed off his knees. "The remainder can be treated preventatively to ensure the infestation does not spread. Perhaps twelve mats in total require some form of attention."

"And the cost?"

Hashimoto named a figure that made Sheldon's stomach tighten. It was substantial—not impossible, but significant. Another reminder that restoration required resources as well as labor. The house demanded investment, not just effort.

"I can phase the work," the craftsman continued, noting Sheldon's expression. "Address the worst damage first, preventing further spread. Then complete the remaining repairs as circumstances allow."

"That would be helpful."

"It is practical. Few people can afford complete restoration at once. The work takes time regardless—I cannot produce replacement mats instantly. Phasing allows the schedule to match the budget."

"You have dealt with this situation before."

"Many times. Houses fall into disrepair, new owners want to restore them, resources are limited." Hashimoto's expression carried something like sympathy beneath his professional demeanor. "The willingness matters more than the timeline. You are willing to do the work properly. That is what counts."

They discussed specifics—which rooms to prioritize, what timeline to expect, how to coordinate with other restoration work. Hashimoto took measurements, made notes, explained the process in detail that Sheldon appreciated even when he did not fully understand.

"The main room first," the craftsman decided. "It is the heart of the house. Once that is restored, the other work can proceed around it." He consulted his notes. "I can begin in two weeks. The replacement mats will need to be made—I do not keep such quantities in stock."

"Two weeks is acceptable."

"Good. I will prepare an estimate in writing. You can review it, ask questions, make decisions." Hashimoto began gathering his tools. "This is a good house. Worth saving. Worth the effort and expense."

"I believe so as well."

"Then we understand each other."

---

After Hashimoto departed, Sheldon remained at the house.

He walked through the rooms slowly, seeing them with new eyes. The damage Hashimoto had identified was invisible to casual observation—the mats looked worn but functional, the signs of infestation hidden beneath surfaces. Only expert assessment had revealed the truth.

This was a lesson, he realized. About the gap between appearance and reality. About the need for expertise in diagnosis. About how problems could grow unnoticed until they became serious.

He stood in the main room, the one that would require the most work. The afternoon light filtered through the old windows, illuminating dust motes that drifted lazily in the still air. This space had history—decades of meals and conversations and daily life had unfolded within these walls. Hideo had built this room, had maintained it, had sat in it with his wife and daughter and grandson.

Now it was damaged, infected by creatures that consumed from within. But it could be restored. The harm was not permanent, the loss not total. With time and effort and resources, the space could be made whole again.

This was true of many things, Sheldon reflected. Damage did not have to be permanent. Healing was possible, if one was willing to do the work. The house would recover from its years of neglect, just as Tenchi was recovering from his mother's death, just as Sheldon himself was recovering from a lifetime of isolation and misplaced priorities.

He thought about his own situation—his hidden nature, the power that hummed beneath his skin, the truth that he was not what he appeared to be. Katsuhito had perceived something, had acknowledged that Sheldon was "more than he seemed." But the old man had chosen to accept the appearance while acknowledging the mystery beneath.

The house, too, would be accepted with its hidden flaws. The damage would be repaired, the problems addressed, the structure made sound again. What mattered was not the current state but the trajectory—the movement toward restoration rather than decay.

He moved through the other rooms, imagining their future functions. The smaller room with minimal damage could become a study, a quiet space for reading and planning. The adjacent room might serve as storage for tools and materials, organized for efficiency. The upper floor, with its good light and private access, would make an excellent workshop.

Here, he imagined, the repair shop would take shape. Customers would bring their broken things—radios and clocks and furniture and appliances. He would diagnose the problems, as Hashimoto had diagnosed the tatami. He would apply his skills and the subtle enhancement of the warmth to find solutions. The room would be filled with the work of maintenance, of keeping the material world functional.

"Two weeks," he said aloud, testing the timeline. Two weeks until the tatami work began. Weeks more until it was complete. Months, perhaps, until the house was truly ready for occupation.

But the future was taking shape. Each day added another element, another connection, another piece of the emerging whole.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, neither impatient nor concerned. Time moved at its own pace. The work would happen when it happened. The house would be ready when it was ready.

And in the meantime, there was the shrine. There was Tenchi. There was the kitten arriving tomorrow. There was life to be lived while the future assembled itself.

Sheldon took one last look around the main room—the space that would become his workspace, his contribution to the village—and turned toward the door.

The walk back to the shrine would give him time to think. Time to plan. Time to appreciate how far he had come in sixteen days.

---

He returned to the shrine in the early afternoon.

The walk had been pleasant, the spring warmth gentle on his skin. Villagers had greeted him as he passed—shopkeepers and craftsmen and housewives going about their daily business. He was recognized now, acknowledged as belonging. The nods and waves and brief exchanges were evidence of integration, of a place being carved in the community.

Katsuhito was practicing calligraphy in the main hall, the sounds of brush on paper creating their gentle rhythm. The old man's concentration was evident in his posture, in the careful stillness of his body between strokes.

Sheldon paused at the doorway, observing without interrupting. The calligraphy practice had become a daily routine now, Katsuhito reclaiming a skill he had let lapse for decades. Each session was an act of memory, of connection to his late wife, of reaching across the gulf that death had created.

The brushes had belonged to Achika. The techniques had been taught by Achika. The practice itself was a conversation with someone no longer present, conducted through the movement of ink on paper.

Sheldon understood this impulse. His own work—the restoration of the house, the establishment of the repair shop—was similarly motivated. He was building something that would serve others, that would contribute to the community, that would create meaning beyond his own existence. It was a conversation with the future, just as Katsuhito's calligraphy was a conversation with the past.

He did not disturb the old man. Instead, he prepared tea and carried it to the engawa, settling into the quiet that the afternoon provided. The shrine was peaceful, the sounds of the mountain filling the spaces between thoughts.

From his position, he could see the great tree in the distance, its ancient presence anchoring the shrine grounds. The shimenawa rope moved gently in the breeze, the paper streamers catching light as they fluttered. Whatever power resided there—whatever had brought him to this place and this time—it seemed content to remain mysterious. It did not demand understanding. It simply existed, like the mountain itself, like the village, like the web of relationships that gave his life meaning.

He reviewed the restoration timeline in his mind. Hashimoto would begin tatami work in two weeks. Tanaka would help with tool restoration starting Friday. The electrical work still needed to be arranged, and the plumbing, and the plastering where walls had been damaged.

The electrical work concerned him most. He understood the principles—voltage and current and resistance, the flow of electrons through conductors—but the practical application in a Japanese house of this era was unfamiliar. He would need to find someone experienced, someone who could assess the existing wiring and recommend appropriate upgrades.

The plumbing was similar. Water and waste required proper handling, and the traditional systems were different from what he had known in his previous life. Another expert to find, another relationship to build.

Each task connected to other tasks. Each step enabled the next. The restoration was not a single project but a web of related efforts, all moving toward the same goal.

This was how lives were built, he realized. Not through grand gestures but through accumulated small steps. Each day's work contributing to the larger pattern. Each relationship strengthening the larger network.

Fifteen days ago, he had been a stranger with nothing. Now he had a family, a community, a house under restoration, a future taking shape. The progress was remarkable when viewed from that perspective.

And tomorrow, a kitten would join the household. Another life to care for, another connection to strengthen, another thread in the weaving.

The warmth hummed its quiet agreement.

---

Tenchi returned from school with singular focus.

The bus deposited him at the mountain's base, and he ran up the path faster than usual, his school bag bouncing against his back. He burst into the shrine grounds with the energy of someone who had been waiting all day for this moment.

"Is Hashimoto-san done? Can I start? Is everything ready?"

"Hashimoto-san completed his assessment this morning. Yes, you can start. And readiness depends on your preparations."

"Okay okay okay." Tenchi dropped his bag at the door and headed immediately for the mudroom. "Where's the litter box? And the food dishes? And the—"

"Everything is in the storage area where we placed it after our shopping trip. You will need to retrieve each item and position it appropriately."

"Right. Right." The boy was already moving, his focus absolute. "I planned this. I know where everything goes."

Sheldon followed at a distance, observing rather than directing. This was Tenchi's project, his preparation for the responsibility he had asked to assume. Guidance could be offered if needed, but the work should be his.

The mudroom was a small space attached to the main house—originally intended for removing shoes and storing outdoor items, now being repurposed as a kitten's initial home. Tenchi stood in the doorway, surveying the space with an assessing eye that reminded Sheldon of Hashimoto examining the tatami.

"The litter box goes in the far corner," Tenchi said, pointing. "Away from where people walk. Private."

"That seems appropriate."

"The food and water dishes go on the opposite side. Cats don't like eating near their litter box. I read that in a book at school."

"You have been researching."

"I had to know things. So I could be a good owner." Tenchi retrieved the litter box from storage and carried it carefully to the designated corner. "The bed goes near the door, so he can see when people come. So he won't be surprised."

The logic was sound, the planning evident. Tenchi had genuinely prepared for this responsibility, had thought through the kitten's needs rather than only his own desires.

"The blanket should smell like me," Tenchi continued, arranging the small bed. "That's why I've been sleeping with the extra blanket. So it has my smell. Then he'll feel like I'm there even when I'm at school."

"That is very thoughtful."

"Yamamoto-san said cats care about smells more than anything. They know people by how they smell." He tucked the blanket into the bed with careful attention. "I want him to know me right away. To feel safe."

The preparation continued for nearly an hour. Tenchi positioned and repositioned items, adjusted angles, considered sight lines. He filled the water dish to test its stability, examined the litter box for sharp edges, tested the bed's comfort by pressing on it with his hand.

"I think it's ready," he finally declared, stepping back to survey the result. "Do you think it's ready?"

Sheldon entered the mudroom and examined the setup. The litter box was appropriately positioned, the food and water dishes stable and accessible, the bed comfortable and visible from the entrance. The space was clean, organized, and clearly prepared with care.

"I think it is excellent," he said. "You have created a welcoming space."

"Really?"

"Really. A kitten arriving here would feel that someone cared about his comfort."

Tenchi's smile was radiant. "Tomorrow," he said. "Tomorrow he'll be here. In this room. Sleeping in that bed."

"Tomorrow."

"I can't wait. I've never wanted something this much. Except—" He paused, his expression flickering. "Except for Mom to not be sick. I wanted that more than anything."

The moment shifted, joy touching grief in the way that seemed characteristic of Tenchi's emotional landscape.

"That was a different kind of wanting," Sheldon said. "You wanted her to be well because you loved her. You want the kitten because you're ready to give that love to something new."

"Is that okay? To love something new?"

"It is not only okay—it is necessary. Love is not diminished by being shared. Loving the kitten does not mean loving your mother less."

"That's what Grandpa said too. Almost exactly."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"Yeah." Tenchi looked around the prepared space one more time. "Mom would want me to have something to love. She told me that once. She said love was like a garden—you had to keep planting things, or it would go empty."

"That is a beautiful image."

"She was good at saying things that made sense." Tenchi moved toward the door, then paused. "Do you think she knows? About the kitten?"

"I believe she knows. And I believe she is happy for you."

The boy nodded, accepting this assurance as he had accepted others. The faith was simple and complete—his mother watched, his mother knew, his mother approved.

"Tomorrow," he said again, the word carrying everything.

---

Dinner was a celebration in anticipation.

Katsuhito had prepared something special—tempura, the battered and fried vegetables that Tenchi loved. Sweet potato, eggplant, green beans, and shrimp emerged from the oil golden and crisp, arranged artfully on a serving plate. The aroma filled the kitchen, warm and inviting.

"This is fancy," Tenchi observed, reaching for a piece of sweet potato.

"Fancy has its place. Special occasions deserve recognition."

"Is getting a kitten a special occasion?"

"Welcoming a new member of the household is always a special occasion. Whether that member has two legs or four." Katsuhito added more items to the frying oil, the sizzle punctuating his words. "Your mother received a special dinner when you were born. Your grandmother made tempura then as well."

"Really? Mom told me about when I was born, but she didn't mention tempura."

"Perhaps she forgot. Or perhaps she remembered other things as more important." The old man's expression softened slightly. "She was very happy that day. Tired, but happy. She said you were the best thing she had ever made."

Tenchi smiled at this, the connection to his mother warming the moment. "She was good at making things. Not cooking things, but other things. She made me a blanket once, with my name sewn into it."

"She was good at many things." Katsuhito retrieved the finished tempura and added it to the plate. "As you will be, in time. The making of things is in your blood."

"Like making the fort?"

"Like making the fort. Like preparing the mudroom for your kitten. Like building a life from the materials you are given."

The philosophy seemed to resonate with Tenchi, who nodded seriously while reaching for a piece of shrimp.

"What did Hashimoto-san say about the house?" the boy asked, demonstrating that he had not entirely forgotten about Sheldon's day.

"The tatami damage is significant but repairable. Six mats need complete replacement, several others need repair. He will begin work in two weeks."

"That's a lot of waiting."

"Restoration takes time. The materials must be prepared, the schedule arranged. But the house is not going anywhere. It will be there when the work is ready to begin."

"Like the kitten," Tenchi said, making a connection. "We had to wait for him to be ready too. And now he is, and tomorrow he comes home."

"Yes. Readiness cannot be rushed."

"But it's still hard to wait."

"It is. Patience is difficult precisely because it is valuable. If patience were easy, everyone would have it. Its difficulty is what makes it worth cultivating."

Tenchi considered this while chewing his tempura. "I think I'm getting better at patience. I only asked about the kitten like ten times today. Last week I would have asked a hundred times."

"That is significant improvement."

"I'm practicing. Like Grandpa practices calligraphy. Patience is just practice too, right?"

"That is exactly right. Every skill requires practice, including the skills of character."

Katsuhito, who had been listening silently while managing the frying, allowed a small smile. "You are learning, Tenchi. Learning to understand how things connect. That is more important than any single lesson."

"Everything connects to everything," the boy said, repeating something Sheldon had told him days ago. "That's what makes it all make sense."

"Precisely. The kitten connects to patience. Patience connects to practice. Practice connects to skill. Skill connects to capability. Capability connects to independence." The old man set down his cooking implements and joined them at the table. "Each step leads to the next, and together they lead to a full life."

"I want a full life," Tenchi declared. "With lots of connections."

"Then you are already on the right path."

---

Bath time was extended by excitement.

The water was warm around Tenchi, the steam rising in gentle clouds. But his energy refused to dissipate, his mind racing through scenarios for tomorrow. He narrated possibilities while soaking—the kitten's first exploration of the mudroom, its first meal, its first purr in his arms.

"What if he's scared at first? Being in a new place?"

"He probably will be scared at first. That is normal. New places are overwhelming."

"What should I do?"

"Be calm. Be patient. Let him approach you when he is ready. Do not chase or grab—that will frighten him more."

"Just wait?"

"Just wait. And speak softly. Let him learn that you are safe." Sheldon had positioned himself near the bath, close enough to monitor but not intruding on the boy's space. "Cats are sensitive to energy. If you are anxious and excited, he will feel that and become anxious himself. If you are calm and steady, he will feel that too."

"How do I be calm when I'm excited?"

"That is the challenge. You practice." Sheldon thought about how to explain. "Take slow breaths. Focus on what you are doing in the moment rather than what might happen later. Tell yourself that the kitten will still be there in five minutes, in an hour, tomorrow. There is no rush."

"No rush," Tenchi repeated, testing the concept. "Even though I've been rushing all day."

"Even though. The rushing does not make the kitten arrive faster. It only makes you tired and anxious."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, considering this. The water rippled gently as he shifted position.

"It's hard to be calm about things you really want."

"It is. That is why calmness requires practice, like any skill."

"But you're always calm. Don't you want things?"

The question caught Sheldon off guard. It was perceptive, the kind of observation children made when they were paying attention more closely than adults expected.

"I want things," he said carefully. "I want this life I am building. I want the house to be restored. I want to belong here, to be useful, to make a difference." He paused. "But I have learned that wanting does not require anxiety. I can work toward goals without being consumed by them."

"How did you learn that?"

"Through making mistakes. Through wanting things so intensely that I forgot to enjoy the journey toward them. Through realizing that the wanting itself was causing more suffering than the waiting."

"Did it take a long time to learn?"

"It took most of my previous life. I am still learning." He smiled slightly. "Perhaps that is why I am here—to practice what I finally understand."

"Like you did with me," Tenchi said, the connection suddenly clear. "When you first came. You waited. You let me get used to you."

Sheldon had not consciously thought of it that way, but the parallel was accurate. He had approached Tenchi carefully, patiently, allowing trust to develop rather than forcing connection.

"Yes," he said. "Like that."

"And now I'm not scared of you at all. Now I love you."

The words landed simply, stated as fact rather than declaration. Tenchi continued his bath narration without apparent awareness of what he had said, but Sheldon felt the impact.

Love. Spoken without hesitation. Accepted as obvious truth.

"I love you too," he said, equally simply.

"I know," Tenchi replied, as though this had never been in question. "That's why you help me with stuff. That's why you built the fort with me and taught me about patience and everything."

The logic was flawless in its directness. Love manifested through action. Actions demonstrated love. The equation was clear to a five-year-old, even if adults often complicated it.

"That is exactly right."

"Tomorrow is going to be the best day," Tenchi said, returning to his primary focus. "I can already tell. I'm going to be calm and patient and the kitten is going to love me."

"I believe he will."

---

Bedtime was difficult.

Tenchi's excitement resisted sleep with remarkable tenacity. He lay in his futon with eyes that refused to close, his mind too active for rest.

"Try counting," Sheldon suggested. "Or breathing slowly."

"I tried. My brain won't listen."

"Your brain is excited. That is understandable."

"Can you tell me a story? Sometimes that helps."

Sheldon considered what story might be appropriate. Not something too exciting, which would only add fuel to the wakefulness. Something calm, something rhythmic, something that might lull rather than stimulate.

"When I was young," he began, "my grandmother had a garden. It was not a large garden, but it was carefully tended. Every plant had its place, every flower its season."

"Like a schedule?"

"Yes, like a schedule. The crocuses came first, in early spring. Then the daffodils, then the tulips. Each one knew when to bloom and did so without rushing."

"What happened next?"

"Then came the roses, in summer. They took longer to prepare, needed more care. But when they finally bloomed, they were the most beautiful of all. Worth the wait."

"Like the kitten."

"Like the kitten. He needed time to grow strong enough to leave his mother. But tomorrow, he will be ready. And he will be worth the wait."

Tenchi's eyes were growing heavy, the story's gentle rhythm doing its work.

"Your grandmother sounds nice."

"She was. She taught me that some things cannot be hurried. That patience is not just waiting—it is trusting that the right moment will come."

"Did the right moment always come?"

"Not always. Some things we wait for never arrive. But the waiting still matters. It teaches us what we truly want."

"I truly want the kitten," Tenchi murmured, sleep finally claiming him.

"I know. And tomorrow, he will be here."

The boy's breathing evened out, tension releasing from his small body. Sleep had won the battle against excitement, at least for tonight.

Sheldon sat with him for a few minutes more, feeling the quiet of the room, the peace of a child at rest. Tomorrow would bring change, new responsibilities, new joys. But tonight, there was only this moment—the stillness, the trust, the love that had been spoken and reciprocated.

---

On the engawa, stars filled the sky.

Katsuhito had retired early, tired from the day's activities. Sheldon sat alone, watching the heavens wheel overhead, thinking about the conversations of the day.

Tenchi had said "I love you" without hesitation, without ceremony, without apparent awareness that the words carried weight. To him, love was obvious—a natural consequence of the care he had received, the attention that had been paid to his needs and fears.

It was, Sheldon realized, how love should work. Not something declared and analyzed, but something lived and demonstrated. Not a destination but a journey, traveled one day at a time.

Tomorrow would bring a kitten. A small creature that would need feeding and cleaning and patience. A responsibility that Tenchi had asked for and prepared for. A test of the boy's growing capacity for care.

And beyond the kitten, the restoration would continue. Hashimoto's assessment had defined the next steps. Friday would bring tool restoration with Tanaka. The electrical work waited, the plumbing, the plastering. Each task moving the house closer to readiness, each day moving Sheldon closer to the life he was building.

Sixteen days. Just over two weeks. And tomorrow, seventeen.

The warmth hummed in his chest, quiet and constant. Whatever power it represented, it seemed satisfied with the progress being made. With the relationships deepening, the trust strengthening, the love growing.

He sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Tomorrow would bring change. Tomorrow would bring a kitten. Tomorrow, Tenchi's patience would finally be rewarded.

But tonight, there was rest. There was peace. There was the quiet satisfaction of a day well spent and a future taking shape.

Sixteen days down.

Tomorrow, seventeen.

## Day 17

---

## Wednesday, April 19, 1989

---

The day began before dawn.

Sheldon woke to small sounds from Tenchi's room—the rustle of movement, the creak of floorboards, the unmistakable signs of a child who could not sleep. He rose quietly and made his way to the door, finding it already slightly open.

Tenchi sat on his futon, Usagi-chan clutched to his chest, staring at the wall with the intensity of someone willing the sun to rise faster.

"You are awake early."

The boy started slightly, then relaxed. "I couldn't sleep anymore. My brain kept thinking."

"What was it thinking about?"

"Everything. Whether he'll like the mudroom. Whether he'll be scared on the walk here. Whether he'll remember me." Tenchi's voice was small in the pre-dawn darkness. "What if he doesn't remember me?"

"He will remember you. Yamamoto-san said he perks up when visitors arrive, as though expecting someone. That someone is you."

"You really think so?"

"I really think so." Sheldon settled himself near the doorway. "But even if he needs time to remember, that is acceptable. You will remind him. You will show him through your care that you are his person."

Tenchi nodded slowly, the reassurance settling some of his anxiety. "Today is the day."

"Today is the day."

"I've been waiting so long."

"Twelve days. Since you first visited Yamamoto-san and met him."

"That's forever."

"It felt like forever. But it also went quickly, did it not? The days were full of other things—the fort, the trip to Kurashiki, preparing the mudroom. The waiting was filled with life."

"I guess so." Tenchi hugged Usagi-chan tighter. "But now the waiting is almost over. Now he's actually coming."

"He is. This afternoon, after you return from school."

The boy's face fell slightly. "I still have to go to school."

"You still have to go to school. But the morning will pass, and then the afternoon will come, and then—"

"And then he'll be here." The smile returned, fragile but genuine. "Okay. I can do school. I can be patient for a few more hours."

"You can. You have proven that you can."

---

Breakfast was consumed with unusual speed.

Tenchi ate mechanically, his attention clearly elsewhere. He answered questions in monosyllables, nodded at observations without fully processing them, moved through his morning routine with the distracted efficiency of someone whose mind was already hours ahead.

"Remember," Katsuhito said, as the boy prepared to leave, "the kitten will not arrive until afternoon. There is no benefit to rushing through your day."

"I know."

"And you will learn nothing if your mind is not present in your lessons."

"I know."

"And—"

"Grandpa, I know." Tenchi's voice carried the particular frustration of a child who had heard the same advice multiple times. "I'll pay attention. I'll be patient. I'll wait."

"Good."

The bus horn sounded in the distance. Tenchi grabbed his bag and headed for the door, then paused and turned back.

"You'll get him while I'm at school? You and Tsukino-san?"

"We will collect him from Yamamoto-san and bring him home. He will be here when you return."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Tenchi nodded once, solemnly, then disappeared down the path. His footsteps were faster than usual, as though hurrying toward the bus would somehow hurry the entire day.

The shrine fell quiet in his absence.

---

The morning's shrine work took on a particular quality.

Sheldon swept the paths with his usual care, but his mind was divided—part attending to the task, part anticipating the afternoon. He understood Tenchi's distraction now, felt a shadow of it himself. The kitten's arrival had become an event for the whole household, not just the boy who had requested it.

Ishikawa was present at the water basin, as expected.

"Good morning," Sheldon said. "Today is the day. The new small creature joins our household."

The frog blinked, apparently unmoved by this announcement.

"You will never meet him, I expect. Your domain is here, at the water. His domain will be the mudroom, then the house, then perhaps the grounds. But not this corner. This corner belongs to you."

Ishikawa's throat pulsed gently, which Sheldon chose to interpret as acknowledgment.

"I wonder if you were once new here as well. If you arrived one day and had to learn the territory, establish your place, prove that you belonged." He changed the water with practiced movements. "All creatures must do this, I think. Find their place. Earn their belonging. It is the universal challenge."

The frog hopped into the fresh water and settled onto its rock with evident satisfaction. Whatever philosophical observations Sheldon offered, the practical comforts of clean water and warm stone remained paramount.

"Wise prioritization," Sheldon observed. "Philosophy is pleasant, but the basics matter more."

---

Mid-morning, Katsuhito emerged from his calligraphy practice.

The old man's fingers bore fresh ink stains, evidence of concentrated effort. His expression carried the particular satisfaction of practice completed, of skills slowly returning.

"The morning's work is done," he said. "We should prepare for the afternoon's task."

"What preparation is needed? The mudroom is ready."

"The mudroom is ready for the kitten. But are we ready for Tenchi?" Katsuhito's eyes held a knowing glint. "He will be overwhelmed with excitement. Managing that energy while also managing a frightened kitten will require coordination."

"You are suggesting we plan our approach."

"I am suggesting we anticipate the challenges. A five-year-old's enthusiasm is a powerful force. It can be wonderful, but it can also be overwhelming—to the child, to the adults, to the small creature caught in its path."

Sheldon nodded, understanding. "What do you suggest?"

"When we return with the kitten, you should intercept Tenchi at the path. Give him a moment to calm himself before entering the mudroom. I will settle the kitten in its space, allow it to orient before being subjected to the full force of Tenchi's attention."

"A staged introduction."

"Precisely. The kitten's first moments in its new home should be calm. Tenchi can join once the initial shock has passed."

"And if Tenchi resists the staging?"

"Then you will remind him of what you have taught him. Patience. Calm. The understanding that love expresses itself through consideration for the other's needs, not through the immediate satisfaction of one's own desires."

The plan was sound, the reasoning solid. Sheldon appreciated how Katsuhito thought through challenges, anticipated difficulties, prepared solutions before problems arose.

"I will manage Tenchi. You will manage the kitten."

"Yes. And together, we will manage the transition."

---

They collected the kitten after lunch.

The walk to Yamamoto-san's house took twenty minutes, long enough for Sheldon to notice the nervous energy in his own body. He was not the one who had asked for a kitten, not the one who had waited with desperate patience—but the anticipation had become shared, a household emotion rather than an individual one.

Yamamoto-san met them at her door, her expression warm. "You are right on time. He has been restless all morning, as though he knows something is happening."

"Animals sense change," Katsuhito said. "They feel the energy of approaching transitions."

"Perhaps so. Or perhaps he has simply learned the rhythm of the household and noticed that something was different today." She stepped aside to let them enter. "Either way, he has been watching the door since breakfast."

The house was neat and well-maintained, the kind of home that had been lived in for decades by someone who valued order. Family photographs lined the hallway, and Sheldon noticed several featuring a younger Yamamoto-san with people who might have been her husband and children.

She led them through the house to the room where the kittens lived. It was a small space, converted from what might once have been a sewing room, now devoted entirely to the cat family. The mother cat watched from a cushion, her remaining offspring playing around her. But the orange kitten—Tenchi's kitten—sat apart from the others, his attention on the doorway.

When he saw Katsuhito, his ears perked forward. Recognition, perhaps, or simple curiosity about the new arrivals. His orange fur caught the light from the window, making him seem to glow.

"He remembers you," Yamamoto-san said. "He watched you last time you were here, with the boy. He sat at attention the entire visit, as though he knew something important was happening."

"Tenchi will be pleased to know that."

"The boy made quite an impression. Most children are grabby with kittens—they want to hold and squeeze and control. But Tenchi was different. He waited. He let the kitten come to him. That takes unusual maturity for a five-year-old."

"He has been learning patience."

"It shows." Yamamoto-san moved to a shelf and retrieved a small carrier—a sturdy cardboard box with ventilation holes cut in the sides and a soft cloth lining the bottom. "I prepared this for the journey. It is not fancy, but it will keep him secure."

She lifted the orange kitten gently, cradling him against her chest for a moment before placing him in the carrier. He protested briefly, a small mew of confusion, then settled when she spoke softly to him.

"Shh, little one. You are going to your new home. To the boy who has been waiting for you."

The kitten's ears rotated toward her voice, then stilled as he accepted the situation. He was a calm creature, Sheldon observed. Adaptable. That would serve him well in the transition ahead.

"He is healthy, well-fed, and accustomed to human handling. He should adapt quickly to his new home." Yamamoto-san handed the carrier to Katsuhito with visible care. "The boy prepared well. I could see it in how he interacted with the kitten, how he thought about its needs rather than only his own. He will be a good guardian."

"We believe so as well."

"Tell him—" Yamamoto-san paused, seeming to weigh her words carefully. Her expression shifted, becoming more serious. "Tell him that Kiyone would be proud. She loved cats. She would be happy to know her son has one of his own."

The mention of Kiyone shifted the moment, added weight to the simple transaction. This was not just a pet being adopted. This was a connection to Tenchi's mother, another thread linking past and present.

"You knew her well," Sheldon said.

"I taught her, when she was young. And I visited her, at the end." Yamamoto-san's voice was quiet. "She spoke of Tenchi often. Her concern for him was her greatest burden, even greater than the illness itself. She knew she was leaving him, and it tormented her."

"She left him in good hands."

"Yes. Katsuhito-san has done well by him. And now you are here as well." Her eyes met Sheldon's, assessing. "She would have wanted him to have people who could teach him patience, who could show him how to care for others. That is what you are doing, whether you realize it or not."

"I am trying."

"The trying matters. Kiyone knew that. She tried until the very end, even when trying hurt, even when the odds were impossible. That is what she would want for Tenchi—not perfection, but sincere effort." Yamamoto-san moved toward the door, signaling that the visit was concluding. "Bring him to visit sometime. I would like to see how he grows."

"We will," Sheldon said.

"We will tell him," Katsuhito added, referring to the earlier message about Kiyone.

---

The walk back was careful.

Katsuhito carried the box steady and level, minimizing the kitten's discomfort. Small sounds emerged occasionally—confused mews, the scratch of claws on cardboard—but nothing that suggested distress. The kitten was uncertain, not frightened.

"How long before Tenchi returns?" Sheldon asked.

"The bus arrives in approximately one hour. Enough time to settle the kitten and prepare the boy."

"He will have been watching the clock all day."

"Undoubtedly. His teacher will be relieved to see him go." A slight smile touched Katsuhito's features. "I remember how Kiyone was before significant events. She could not sit still, could not focus, could not think of anything else. Tenchi inherited this trait."

"Along with her bravery."

"And her stubbornness. And her capacity for love." The old man's expression softened. "She would have enjoyed this day. Watching her son receive his first pet, seeing his excitement, sharing in his joy. These were the moments she lived for."

"She is here, in a way. Through Tenchi. Through the continuity of care."

"Yes. That is how the dead remain with us. Not as ghosts or spirits, but as echoes in the living. We carry them forward through our choices, our values, our ways of being in the world."

They walked in silence for a while, the kitten quiet in his carrier, the mountain path gentle beneath their feet. The afternoon sun filtered through the trees, creating patterns of light and shadow that shifted with the breeze.

"You speak of the dead with familiarity," Katsuhito observed. "Have you lost many people?"

The question was direct, the kind Katsuhito often asked—probing but not invasive, curious but not demanding.

"My grandmother. She was the only person who truly cared for me in my youth. When she died, I felt... untethered. As though the last rope connecting me to belonging had been cut."

"And now?"

"Now I have new ropes. New connections. I am learning that attachment can be rebuilt, that belonging can be found again."

"That is a valuable lesson. Many people never learn it. They let loss define them, close themselves to new connections for fear of future pain."

"I was such a person, for many years. It did not serve me well."

"Few defenses serve us well in the long run. They protect us from immediate hurt at the cost of lasting isolation." Katsuhito shifted his grip on the carrier. "You have chosen differently here. You have allowed yourself to be vulnerable, to attach, to invest in connections that could cause you pain."

"It seemed necessary. And worthwhile."

"It is both."

---

The shrine came into view, and with it, the awareness that time was accelerating.

They entered through the main gate, moving with purpose toward the mudroom. Katsuhito settled the carrier on the floor, opened the door carefully, and stepped back to allow the kitten to emerge at his own pace.

The orange head appeared first—ears rotating, whiskers twitching, nose sampling the unfamiliar air. The kitten paused at the carrier's edge, gathering information before committing to emergence. Then the body followed, cautious steps onto the tatami, immediate alertness to the new environment.

He was small, Sheldon realized—smaller than he had seemed at Yamamoto-san's house, where he had been surrounded by his siblings. Alone in this new space, the kitten's youth was apparent. Eight weeks old, barely weaned, facing the first major transition of his life.

But he did not seem afraid. Cautious, yes. Alert, certainly. But not afraid. There was a quality of curiosity in his movements, an eagerness to understand rather than a desire to hide.

"The water and food are there," Katsuhito said softly, gesturing toward one corner. "The litter box is in the far corner. The bed is by the door."

The kitten processed this information in his own way, moving slowly around the perimeter of the room, sniffing each element of his new territory. His tail was slightly raised—a sign of confidence, Sheldon recalled from somewhere—and his ears were forward, engaged rather than flattened in fear.

He found the water dish first and drank briefly, his small tongue lapping with the delicate efficiency that cats seemed to possess from birth. Then he investigated the bed, pressing on it with one paw, then two, testing its texture and stability. He circled it once, seemed to find it acceptable, and continued his exploration.

The litter box received careful attention. He approached it, sniffed the edge, stepped inside experimentally. Whatever instincts governed such matters seemed to be functioning properly—he understood the purpose without needing instruction.

The food dish was empty, waiting for evening feeding. He sniffed it anyway, catalogued its location, moved on.

Finally, he investigated the room's corners, the junction where walls met floor, the small spaces that might offer hiding if hiding became necessary. He found nothing threatening, nothing confusing, nothing that required defensive action.

"He is adapting well," Sheldon observed.

"He is cautious but not fearful. That is a good temperament. He will adjust."

They watched as the kitten completed his circuit and settled in the center of the room, sitting with his tail wrapped around his paws, observing his observers. His orange fur caught the afternoon light, making him seem to glow.

"Now we wait for Tenchi."

---

The bus arrived precisely on schedule.

Sheldon had positioned himself at the point where the path from the road met the shrine grounds. He could see Tenchi coming—the small figure running rather than walking, school bag bouncing, urgency in every movement.

"Is he here? Is he here? Where is he?"

"He is here. He is in the mudroom. But—" Sheldon raised a hand as Tenchi tried to push past. "Wait."

"But I want to see him!"

"I know. But he has just arrived. He is scared and confused. He needs a moment to settle before being greeted."

Tenchi's face showed the struggle—the desperate desire to rush forward warring with the understanding he had been building. The patience he had practiced.

"You taught me about this," he said, his voice strained. "About being calm. About letting him come to me."

"I did. And now is when that teaching matters. Can you be calm?"

The boy took a deep breath, then another. His hands, which had been trembling with eagerness, steadied slightly. His body shifted from forward-leaning urgency to something more centered.

"I can try."

"Trying is enough. Come with me."

They walked together toward the mudroom—not running, not rushing, each step deliberate. Tenchi's hand found Sheldon's and gripped it tightly, the physical contact providing stability.

At the mudroom door, they paused. Sheldon looked down at Tenchi.

"He is inside with your grandfather. He has explored the space, drunk some water, found his bed. He is calm now. We must help him stay calm."

"I understand."

"When we enter, move slowly. Sit on the floor near the door. Let him approach you when he is ready. Do not reach for him unless he comes to you first."

"Okay." Tenchi's voice was small but determined. "I can do this."

"I know you can."

Sheldon slid the door open quietly, and they entered together.

---

The kitten was where they had left him—seated in the center of the room, watchful and alert. His ears swiveled toward the sound of the door, his eyes fixing on the new arrivals.

Tenchi sank to the floor near the entrance, just as he had been instructed. His movements were controlled, though Sheldon could see the effort it cost him. Every line of his body wanted to rush forward, to scoop up the small creature, to hold and cuddle and love. But he held himself still.

"Hey," Tenchi said softly. "Remember me?"

The kitten's ears twitched. Something in the voice seemed to register—familiar, perhaps, or simply non-threatening. He did not flee, did not flatten, did not show fear.

"I'm Tenchi. We met at Yamamoto-san's house. You sat in my lap and purred."

The kitten tilted his head slightly, the gesture almost comically curious.

"I've been waiting for you. I prepared this whole room, just for you. See the bed? It has my blanket, so it smells like me. And the food dish—I'll fill that for you every morning and evening. And the water—"

The kitten took a tentative step forward.

Tenchi fell silent, holding his breath. Sheldon watched from near the door, equally still, equally aware that this moment was delicate.

Another step. The kitten's nose twitched, sampling the air, processing the scent of the boy who had held him twelve days ago. Whatever he found in that scent, it was not alarming. He continued forward.

Tenchi remained motionless, his hands flat on his thighs, his body radiating a mixture of hope and restraint that was almost painful to witness. He wanted so badly to reach out. He was trying so hard not to.

The kitten reached him. Sniffed his knee. Sniffed his hand. Then, with the casual confidence of a cat who had made a decision, he stepped into Tenchi's lap and settled there.

The sound that emerged from Tenchi was not quite a laugh, not quite a sob—something in between, something that held everything he had been feeling for the past twelve days. His hands came up slowly, so slowly, to rest on the kitten's back. The fur was soft. The body was warm. The kitten was real.

"He remembers me," Tenchi whispered. "He actually remembers me."

"He remembers," Katsuhito confirmed from across the room. "You made an impression."

The kitten began to purr. The sound was small—kitten-sized—but it filled the mudroom completely. It was the sound of acceptance, of trust, of connection. The sound of a small creature saying: *Yes. You are my person. I choose you.*

Tenchi's tears came then, silent and unashamed. They tracked down his cheeks and dripped onto the orange fur, and the kitten did not seem to mind at all.

---

They sat together for a long time.

Tenchi did not want to move, did not want to disturb the perfect moment he had finally achieved. The kitten seemed equally content, purring steadily in the warm lap, occasionally kneading with his paws in the instinctive gesture that meant comfort and safety.

Katsuhito excused himself after a while, returning to his normal afternoon routine. "Call if you need anything," he said, but the offer was clearly pro forma. This was Tenchi's moment, and he needed nothing but what he had.

Sheldon remained near the door, present but not intrusive. He watched the boy and the kitten together, feeling something shift in his chest—the warmth responding to this small scene of connection, this evidence that love could be found and built and shared.

"I need to think of a name," Tenchi said eventually, his voice dreamy with contentment. "I said I would wait until I knew him. And now I'm starting to know him."

"What are you learning?"

"He's brave. He walked right up to me in a strange place. He wasn't scared." Tenchi stroked the orange fur gently. "And he's patient. He waited for me to be calm before he came over. He's smart like that."

"Those are good qualities."

"And he's warm. Really warm. Like a tiny heating pad." The boy smiled. "I like how he feels. Solid and real."

"Have any names come to you?"

"Maybe. I keep thinking about sunshine. Because he's orange like sunshine, and because—" Tenchi paused, considering. "Because he makes everything feel brighter. Like sunshine does."

"There are several words for sunshine or sun in Japanese."

"I know. Taiyou. Hikaru. Hinata. Niko." He tested each word aloud, feeling how they fit. "I dreamed about Hikaru before. In the dream, he could talk, and he said that was his name."

"Dreams sometimes know things."

"But I also like Hinata. It means 'sunny place.' And that's what he is—he's the sunny place in my life now."

The naming would take time, Sheldon realized. It was not a decision to be rushed. The kitten would reveal himself over the coming days, and the right name would emerge from understanding rather than impulse.

"You have time," he said. "There is no hurry."

"I know. But I want him to have a name. A real name, that's just his." Tenchi looked up. "What would you name him?"

"I would not presume. He is your kitten. The name should be yours."

"But if you had to pick?"

Sheldon considered the small creature, still purring contentedly in Tenchi's lap. Orange fur, confident disposition, the willingness to trust despite uncertainty. A creature who had chosen his person and committed to that choice without hesitation.

"Ken," he said. "Strong. Or perhaps Yuki—courage."

"Yuki means snow, though."

"A different character. The one that means bravery."

"Oh." Tenchi tested this. "Yuki. That's nice. But I'll keep thinking." He looked down at the kitten, who had closed his eyes in blissful sleep. "You don't mind not having a name yet, do you? I'll figure it out soon. I just want it to be perfect."

The kitten, predictably, offered no opinion.

---

Dinner was a celebration.

Katsuhito had prepared something special again—this time, grilled fish with vegetables, a meal that required attention and skill. The kitchen filled with savory aromas, and Tenchi bounced between checking on the kitten and helping with preparations.

"He's sleeping," Tenchi reported, returning from his fourth mudroom visit. "Still in the same spot. Curled up really small."

"Kittens sleep a great deal. It is normal."

"I know. But I want to make sure he's okay."

"He is okay. He is safe and warm and fed. Those are his primary concerns at this age." Katsuhito transferred fish to a serving plate. "Yours should be helping me carry dishes to the table."

Tenchi complied, though his attention kept drifting toward the mudroom door. The pull of the new connection was strong, the desire to be near the small creature almost physical.

They sat together for the meal—the first dinner as a household of four, if the sleeping kitten could be counted. The food was excellent, the conversation focused entirely on the afternoon's events.

"Yamamoto-san said something," Sheldon mentioned, deciding the moment was right. "She said to tell you that your mother would be proud. That Kiyone loved cats, and would be happy to know you have one."

Tenchi's chopsticks paused halfway to his mouth. "She said that?"

"She did. She knew your mother. She taught her when she was a child."

"I didn't know that." The boy's expression was complex—pleased and sad and thoughtful all at once. "Mom never told me she loved cats."

"Perhaps she was waiting until you were older to share such things. Or perhaps it simply never came up." Katsuhito's voice was gentle. "We carry many loves that we do not speak of. They are no less real for being unspoken."

"I wish she could meet him. The kitten." Tenchi's voice was small. "I wish she could see how good he is."

"She can see. We have spoken of this before."

"I know. But it's different. Different from her being actually here." He set down his chopsticks. "Sometimes I forget that she's gone. And then I remember, and it's like it happened all over again."

The table was quiet for a moment. Grief lived alongside joy, Sheldon was learning. They were not opposites, not mutually exclusive. Tenchi could be delighted about his kitten and heartbroken about his mother in the same breath.

"That forgetting and remembering will change over time," Katsuhito said. "The forgetting will become less complete—you will always know, somewhere, that she is gone. And the remembering will become less sharp. The pain will soften into something more like... tenderness. A gentle ache rather than a cutting wound."

"Does it ever stop hurting?"

"No. But the hurt transforms. It becomes part of you, woven into your being, rather than a separate thing that attacks you." The old man's voice carried the weight of experience. "I still miss your grandmother. I still feel her absence every day. But the feeling has become familiar, almost comfortable. It reminds me that I loved her, that she mattered, that our time together was precious."

Tenchi absorbed this, his young face serious. "So the hurting is like... a memory of love?"

"Yes. Precisely that."

"Then I don't want it to stop. Not completely." He picked up his chopsticks again. "I want to always remember that I loved her."

"You will. That is one thing I can promise you with certainty."

---

After dinner, Tenchi returned to the mudroom.

The kitten was awake now, exploring his space with renewed curiosity. He had found the mouse toy on the string and was batting at it experimentally, his movements quick and uncoordinated in the way of young animals learning their bodies.

Tenchi sat on the floor and watched, letting the kitten play without interference. This too was patience, was consideration—allowing the small creature to discover his environment rather than directing the exploration.

"You like the mouse?" Tenchi asked. "I picked that out for you. At the pet store in Kurashiki. It took me a long time to choose—there were lots of options. But this one seemed right. Because you're going to be a hunter someday, and hunters need to practice chasing things."

The kitten pounced on the mouse, missed, and tumbled sideways. He recovered immediately, dignity apparently intact, and stalked the toy again with exaggerated care. His hindquarters wiggled as he prepared for the next attempt, the instinctive hunting behavior emerging even at this young age.

"You'll get better at that. Cats are really good hunters when they grow up. Grandpa told me about a cat that used to live here, a long time ago. He said she caught mice and birds and even a snake once." Tenchi smiled. "Maybe you'll catch a snake too. But not too soon. You need to get bigger first."

The kitten achieved a successful pounce this time, trapping the mouse beneath both front paws. He bit at it experimentally, shook it slightly, and found it unsatisfying as actual prey. But the game was the point, not the result. He released the toy for another round of stalking.

"See? You're learning already. Every time is a little better than the last."

Sheldon watched from the doorway, reluctant to intrude on the bonding. This was Tenchi's relationship to build, his connection to nurture. Sheldon's role was support and guidance, not participation.

The kitten noticed him there—the small head turning, ears orienting toward the new presence. But having catalogued Sheldon as non-threatening, he returned to his game without concern. The adults were background now. The toy was the focus.

"He's really smart," Tenchi said, not looking away from the kitten. "See how he remembers where the mouse went, even when it moved? He's learning the patterns."

"Cats are observant. They remember what matters to them."

"So if I'm important to him, he'll remember me? Even when I'm at school?"

"He will remember you. You are already the most important thing in his life. You represent food, comfort, play, safety. His brain is wiring itself around you as we speak."

Tenchi absorbed this with visible satisfaction. To know that he was being learned, that his presence was imprinting on the kitten's developing mind—this was the kind of connection he had longed for.

But when Tenchi looked up and smiled, the expression radiant with happiness, Sheldon felt included anyway. The joy was shared, even if the connection was specifically Tenchi's.

"He's perfect," Tenchi said. "Absolutely perfect."

"He seems to think well of you as well."

"Really?"

"He played in front of you. Cats only play when they feel safe. He feels safe with you watching."

This information seemed to delight Tenchi even more than the kitten's presence itself. To know that he was a source of safety, that his presence provided comfort—this was what he had wanted. Not just to have a pet, but to be trusted by one.

"I'm going to be the best cat owner ever," he declared. "He's never going to be scared or hungry or lonely. I'll make sure of it."

"I believe you will."

---

Bedtime was complicated by the new arrival.

Tenchi did not want to leave the kitten alone for the night. The mudroom suddenly seemed cold and isolated, too far from the boy's room, too separate from the family's warmth.

"He'll be lonely," Tenchi pleaded. "He's never slept alone before. He always had his mother and his brothers and sisters."

"The mudroom was prepared specifically for this purpose," Katsuhito said, his tone firm but not unkind. "He needs to learn that this is his space. If he sleeps with you from the first night, he will expect it always."

"I don't mind if he expects it."

"You may not mind now. But there will be times when it is not convenient or appropriate. It is better to establish the pattern from the beginning."

Tenchi's expression said clearly that he disagreed with this reasoning, but he knew better than to argue directly. Instead, he turned to Sheldon with pleading eyes.

"Can I at least sit with him until he falls asleep? Just for tonight?"

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, who considered the compromise for a moment before nodding.

"Until he falls asleep. Then you come to your own bed."

"I will. I promise."

Sheldon accompanied him to the mudroom, where the kitten was already settling into his bed—the one lined with Tenchi's blanket, the one that smelled of the boy who had claimed him. The transition from play to rest was happening naturally, the kitten's eyelids growing heavy, his body curling into a compact ball.

Tenchi sat beside the bed, not touching, just present. He spoke softly, a stream of gentle words that required no response.

"You're going to like it here. The shrine is really nice, and there are lots of places to explore when you're bigger. The grounds go all the way to the forest, and there are birds you can watch, and bugs you can chase. Grandpa says cats are good for catching mice, so maybe you'll do that too."

The kitten's eyes closed, then opened briefly, then closed again. The purring had stopped, replaced by the steady breathing of approaching sleep.

"And I'll be right here. Not in this room—Grandpa says you need your own space—but right nearby. If you get scared, you can meow and I'll hear you. I have good ears for small sounds."

The breathing evened out completely. The kitten was asleep, safe in his new bed, already beginning to smell like the blanket that smelled like his boy.

"Goodnight," Tenchi whispered. "I'll see you in the morning. First thing. I promise."

He rose quietly, moving with careful steps, and joined Sheldon at the door. They exited together, sliding the door closed with minimal sound.

"He's okay," Tenchi said, more to himself than to Sheldon. "He's okay. He's sleeping."

"He is. You did well."

"Really?"

"Really. You were patient. You let him adjust at his own pace. You respected his need for space while still providing comfort. That is exactly what a good guardian does."

Tenchi's smile was tired but genuine. The day had been long, the emotions intense, but the result was everything he had hoped for.

"Tomorrow I get to wake up and he'll still be here," the boy said, wonder in his voice. "That's never happened before. Every other time I visited him, I had to leave. But now he's staying. He's really staying."

"He is really staying. He is part of the household now."

"Forever?"

"For as long as cats live, which is many years. You will grow up together. He will be with you through many changes."

"That's a lot of years."

"It is. And each one will be precious."

---

The evening concluded on the engawa.

Tenchi had been tucked into bed, his excitement finally yielding to exhaustion. The day's emotions had depleted him, and sleep had claimed him quickly once he lay down.

Katsuhito sat beside Sheldon, looking out at the star-filled sky. The night was clear, the air carrying the particular stillness of spring evenings.

"He did well," the old man said. "Better than I expected. The patience you have been teaching him—it showed today."

"He was motivated. The kitten gave him reason to practice what he had learned."

"Perhaps. But many children cannot apply their learning in moments of intense emotion. Tenchi did. That speaks to something deeper than intellectual understanding."

"He wants to be good. Not just to get things he wants, but genuinely to be the kind of person who acts rightly. I have noticed this in him."

"He has his mother's heart. She was the same way—driven by internal standards rather than external rewards." Katsuhito's voice carried both pride and sorrow. "It made her exceptional, and it made her vulnerable. Those who care deeply about being good often suffer when they fail to meet their own standards."

"Is that a warning?"

"It is an observation. Tenchi will struggle, sometimes, with the gap between who he wants to be and who he manages to be. All good people do. Your role—and mine—is to help him see that the struggle itself is worthy. That perfection is not required, only sincere effort."

Sheldon considered this. "You are speaking from experience."

"I am speaking from decades of watching people wrestle with themselves. Some give up the struggle, become content with their flaws, stop trying to improve. Others torture themselves endlessly, never satisfied, never accepting their own humanity." A pause. "The goal is the middle path. To strive for goodness while accepting limitation. To reach for ideals while embracing imperfection."

"That is a difficult balance."

"All the important things are difficult. If they were easy, they would not be worth pursuing."

They sat in silence for a while, the stars wheeling overhead, the sounds of the night creating their gentle symphony. From somewhere in the house, the faint sound of Tenchi's sleeping breath was almost audible, and from the mudroom, the imagined sound of a kitten doing the same.

"Seventeen days," Sheldon said.

"You are still counting."

"It helps me see the pattern. The progress."

"And what pattern do you see?"

Sheldon considered the question carefully. "Integration. Connection. The gradual weaving of a life into a larger fabric. I arrived with nothing and no one. Now I have... this." He gestured vaguely, encompassing the shrine, the mountain, the sleeping boy, the old man beside him. "I have belonging."

"You have earned belonging. There is a difference."

"Perhaps. But the earning and the having feel similar, in the end. Both require daily renewal. Both must be maintained through action."

"That is wise." Katsuhito rose slowly, his joints protesting the evening chill. "Tomorrow will bring new challenges. The kitten will need attention, Tenchi will need guidance, the work of living will continue. But tonight, we can rest in what has been accomplished."

"Seventeen days of accomplishment."

"Seventeen days of foundation. The building itself will take much longer." The old man moved toward the door, then paused. "But foundations matter. They determine what can be built upon them. Yours is solid."

He disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the satisfaction of a day well spent.

A kitten had joined the household. A boy had received what he had longed for. A family had grown by one small, orange, purring member.

The warmth in Sheldon's chest hummed its quiet approval, acknowledging the significance of the moment. Whatever power it represented, it seemed to understand that love—in all its forms—was worth building.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges, as Katsuhito had said. But tonight, there was only this: the peace of completion, the joy of connection, the knowledge that something good had been added to the world.

Seventeen days down.

A lifetime of building ahead.

## Day 18

---

## Thursday, April 20, 1989

---

Tenchi was awake before the sun.

Sheldon heard the small footsteps padding past his door, heading toward the mudroom with the singular focus of someone who had been waiting for this moment since falling asleep. He rose and followed quietly, curious to see how the first morning would unfold.

The mudroom door was already open when he arrived. Tenchi sat cross-legged on the floor, watching as the orange kitten stretched and yawned in his bed. The small creature had survived his first night alone, and appeared none the worse for the experience.

"He's okay," Tenchi whispered, his voice carrying relief and wonder in equal measure. "He made it through the whole night."

"Did you expect him not to?"

"I don't know. I kept waking up and worrying. What if he was cold? What if he was scared? What if he needed me and I wasn't there?"

"He was warm—his bed is lined with your blanket, remember. He was not scared—cats are nocturnal by nature, comfortable in darkness. And he did not need you—he has everything he requires in this room."

"But I wanted to be there anyway."

"I know. That is love. Wanting to be present even when your presence is not strictly necessary."

The kitten finished his stretch and noticed his audience. His ears perked forward, and he padded across the tatami toward Tenchi with the slightly unsteady gait of a young animal still learning to trust his legs.

"Good morning," Tenchi said, his voice soft and warm. "Did you sleep okay? Were you lonely?"

The kitten responded by climbing into his lap—the same action as yesterday, already becoming routine. The small body curled there, and the purring began almost immediately.

"I think that means he wasn't too lonely," Sheldon observed.

"He's purring. He only purrs when he's happy, right?"

"Mostly. Cats also purr when they're stressed, as a self-soothing mechanism. But this—" He gestured to the relaxed posture, the kneading paws, the half-closed eyes. "This is contentment."

"I made him content." The wonder in Tenchi's voice was unmistakable. "Just by being here."

"Yes. Your presence matters to him. That is what you wanted, is it not?"

"It's exactly what I wanted."

They sat together in the early morning quiet, boy and kitten and observer, while the sky lightened beyond the mudroom's small window. The first morning of many, Sheldon realized. The first of thousands.

---

Breakfast was complicated by divided attention.

Tenchi kept glancing toward the mudroom door, even though the kitten was settled and fed and perfectly capable of entertaining himself. The pull of the new connection was strong, making ordinary tasks feel like obstacles.

"Eat," Katsuhito said, for the third time. "The kitten will still be there when you finish."

"I know. But what if he's doing something interesting and I miss it?"

"Then you will see something interesting when you return. Kittens do interesting things constantly. There is no shortage."

Tenchi complied reluctantly, spooning rice into his mouth without tasting it. His body was at the table; his mind was clearly elsewhere.

"Have you thought more about names?" Sheldon asked, attempting to engage him.

"Some. I keep going back to Hikaru. Because of the dream, and because he really is like light. Everything feels brighter when he's around."

"Hikaru is a good name."

"But I also like Hinata. Sunny place. Because that's what he is—my sunny place."

"Both are appropriate. The choice is yours."

"I know. I just want to be sure. Names matter. You said that."

"I did. But certainty is not always possible. Sometimes we must choose with the information we have, trusting that our instincts will guide us correctly."

Tenchi considered this while chewing. "My instinct says Hikaru. But my brain keeps second-guessing."

"Brains often do. They are excellent at generating alternatives, less excellent at committing to decisions."

"That's annoying."

"It is. But it is also useful. The ability to consider multiple options prevents hasty choices that we might later regret."

"So the annoying thing is also a good thing?"

"Many things are both. Patience is annoying when you want something immediately, but valuable when you need to wait for the right outcome. Fear is annoying when it holds you back, but protective when it warns you of genuine danger." Sheldon sipped his tea. "The skill is learning when each quality serves you and when it hinders you."

"That sounds complicated."

"It is. But you have time to learn."

The bus horn sounded in the distance, cutting short further philosophical exploration. Tenchi scrambled to gather his things, pausing at the door for one last glance toward the mudroom.

"He'll be okay?"

"He will be fine. We will watch over him while you are at school."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Tenchi nodded and disappeared down the path, his footsteps reluctant until they faded into the morning.

---

The morning's shrine work was punctuated by kitten checks.

Sheldon found himself stopping by the mudroom more frequently than strictly necessary, drawn by the same impulse that had pulled Tenchi. The small creature was endlessly watchable—each movement a discovery, each behavior a revelation of feline nature.

The kitten had established patterns already. He slept in his bed during the quietest hours, curled into a compact ball of orange fur with his tail wrapped around his nose. He woke to play with his mouse toy, the hunting instincts emerging in the stalking and pouncing that would someday serve a practical purpose. He ate when food was offered, approaching the dish with enthusiasm that suggested his appetite was healthy and growing. He used the litter box appropriately—a relief, as this basic behavior was crucial to harmonious cohabitation. He explored the perimeter of his territory in regular circuits, checking corners and edges as though confirming that nothing had changed since his last patrol.

"You are adapting well," Sheldon told him during one visit. The kitten was investigating the corner near the water basin, his whiskers brushing the wall as he gathered information. "This is your home now. You belong here."

The kitten looked up at the sound of his voice, ears swiveling to track the words. His orange eyes were bright, curious, alert—the eyes of a creature actively learning about his world. Then, apparently satisfied that nothing important was happening, he returned to stalking the mouse toy.

The toy had become the center of the kitten's hunting practice. He approached it from different angles, testing which approaches worked best. He learned that frontal assaults often failed—the mouse slid away when struck directly. Flanking approaches worked better, and pouncing from above was most successful of all. Each attempt was a lesson, each failure a refinement of technique.

"You are learning," Sheldon observed. "Each try teaches you something new."

The kitten did not acknowledge this observation. The mouse required attention.

Ishikawa was philosophical about the new arrival.

"We have a new resident," Sheldon informed the frog during his water basin duties. "A small orange creature who will probably never visit this corner of the grounds. But you should know he exists."

The frog blinked, unmoved by this news.

"He is Tenchi's. The boy has been waiting for him for nearly two weeks. The waiting is over now, replaced by the having. I am told the having brings its own challenges, different from but not less than the challenges of waiting."

Ishikawa offered no commentary on this observation. The frog's world remained bounded by the water basin, the sun's warmth, the insects that occasionally ventured within reach. The addition of a kitten to the shrine household was, from his perspective, irrelevant to his concerns.

"Though I suppose you might say the same about my concerns," Sheldon continued, changing the water. "The village politics, the house restoration, the relationships I am building—none of this matters to you. Your world is complete without any of it."

The frog adjusted its position on the rock, settling more comfortably.

"Your equanimity is admirable," Sheldon said. "You are undisturbed by matters that do not directly affect you. That is either wisdom or limitation, and I am not certain which. Perhaps both—wisdom and limitation often share a boundary."

The frog hopped into the fresh water, apparently concluding that the conversation had run its course. Whatever philosophical observations Sheldon offered, the practical comforts of clean water and morning warmth remained paramount.

"You prioritize well," Sheldon acknowledged. "That is its own form of wisdom."

---

Mid-morning brought an unexpected visitor.

Sheldon was sweeping the main path when he noticed someone approaching from the village—a figure he did not immediately recognize. As the person drew closer, details resolved: a woman, perhaps in her sixties, carrying a small basket covered with a cloth. Her clothing was neat but practical, the dress of someone accustomed to daily work. Her posture suggested purpose—this was not a casual visit.

She stopped at the shrine entrance and bowed properly before proceeding, her form indicating familiarity with the protocols. The bow was neither too deep nor too shallow, held for exactly the right duration. Someone who had visited shrines many times, Sheldon noted, or who had been taught the proper forms as a child.

"Good morning," Sheldon said, approaching and returning her bow. "Welcome to the shrine."

"Good morning." Her eyes assessed him with frank curiosity, taking in his foreign features, his comfortable handling of the broom, his easy presence on the shrine grounds. "You must be the new resident. The one Masaki-san has taken in."

"I am Tsukino Sheldon, yes."

"I am Nakamura Sachiko. I live in the village—the house with the blue roof, near the temple." She held out the basket, which contained what appeared to be homemade mochi wrapped carefully in wax paper. "I brought these for the household. As welcome, and as thanks."

"Thanks?" Sheldon accepted the basket, surprised by the gesture. The mochi were clearly handmade, shaped with the care that indicated significant effort.

"For what you are doing for Tenchi. The village has been watching." Her expression softened slightly, lines around her eyes crinkling with something that might have been approval. "The boy was... struggling. After his mother died. We all saw it, but none of us knew how to help. We brought food, offered assistance with practical matters, tried to include him in village activities. But the boy needed something else. Something we could not provide."

"He is a resilient child. Much of his improvement is his own work."

"Perhaps. But we have seen the changes since you arrived. He smiles more readily. He speaks more easily, with less of that careful distance he maintained after Kiyone's death. He runs through the village as a child should, rather than walking like a small ghost afraid to disturb the air." Nakamura-san's voice carried the weight of observation, of community attention accumulated over weeks. "The village notices such things. We talk among ourselves. Nothing malicious—simply the natural conversation of people who share their lives."

"I am grateful for the community's concern for Tenchi."

"Concern, yes. And curiosity." Her eyes held his for a moment, direct and assessing. "You are a mystery, Tsukino-san. A foreigner who appeared from nowhere, who speaks our language as though born to it, who has integrated himself into the Masaki household with remarkable speed. Who works at the shrine, who restored the Tsukino house, who built a fort in the forest with a grieving boy. The village wonders about you."

"What does the village conclude?"

"Nothing yet. We are still watching. Still gathering evidence." A slight smile touched her features, softening the directness of her words. "But so far, what we see is good. A man who works hard without complaint. Who treats Tenchi with patience and genuine attention. Who respects the traditions of the shrine and the rhythms of village life. Who seeks to learn from our craftsmen rather than arriving with assumptions about knowing better."

"I have much to learn. The traditions here are valuable."

"They are. And you seem to understand that—to value what we value, rather than seeking to change us into something else." She adjusted her posture slightly, a gesture that suggested the formal portion of the visit was concluding. "Whatever mystery surrounds your arrival, your actions speak clearly. We are inclined to trust what we see rather than speculate about what we do not know."

"I hope my actions continue to speak well."

"As do we." She bowed slightly. "I will not keep you from your duties. Enjoy the mochi. They are my grandmother's recipe—the village has been making them for generations. The rice comes from the Harada family's fields, and the preparation follows methods unchanged for a hundred years. They are not just food. They are community, continuity, connection."

"Then I receive them with the respect they deserve."

"Good." Something in her expression suggested she had tested him and found his response acceptable. "Welcome to the village, Tsukino-san. Properly, this time, from someone who speaks for more than herself."

She departed as quietly as she had arrived, her footsteps measured on the stone path, her purpose apparently fulfilled. Sheldon watched her go, holding the basket and contemplating the invisible network of observation that surrounded him.

The village was watching. The village was judging. And now, it seemed, the village had reached a verdict—provisional, perhaps, subject to revision based on future evidence. But favorable. Accepting.

He brought the mochi to the kitchen and placed them with the other food supplies. They would be a pleasant addition to the evening meal, a gift from the community that was slowly accepting him as one of their own. But they were more than that, too. They were a message. A welcome. A declaration of tentative trust.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, as though acknowledging the significance of the moment.

---

Katsuhito emerged from his calligraphy practice around noon.

His fingers bore the now-familiar ink stains, and his expression carried the particular satisfaction of effort expended. The practice sessions were growing longer, Sheldon had noticed—the old man's concentration deepening as his skills slowly returned.

"Nakamura-san visited," Sheldon reported. "She brought mochi."

"Ah. Sachiko. She is the village's unofficial observer. When she visits, it means the community has reached a consensus about something."

"She said the village has been watching."

"They always watch. It is the nature of small communities—everyone's business is everyone's concern." Katsuhito examined the mochi with approval. "But her visit means they have decided you are acceptable. Otherwise, she would not have brought gifts."

"That is reassuring."

"It should be. The village's acceptance is not easily earned. They are cautious about outsiders, protective of their own." He selected a piece of mochi and bit into it thoughtfully. "Good. Sachiko's grandmother taught her well."

"She mentioned that the village has noticed changes in Tenchi."

"They would. The boy was their concern as well as ours—he is connected to too many families to be invisible. His mother was born here, grew up here, married here. When she died, the village mourned with us." Katsuhito's expression grew more serious. "And when Tenchi withdrew into grief, the village worried. They did not know how to reach him. They sent food, offered help, but the boy needed something they could not provide."

"What did he need?"

"Something new. Someone without the weight of shared loss, without the memories that reminded him constantly of what he had lost." The old man met Sheldon's eyes. "You arrived with no history, no expectations, no grief of your own—or at least, none connected to Kiyone. You could meet him fresh, build something new, offer presence without the burden of the past."

"I did have grief. Have it still. My grandmother—"

"Yes. But it was different grief, separate grief. It did not remind Tenchi of his mother. It did not make him relive her absence every time he looked at you." Katsuhito finished his mochi and brushed crumbs from his fingers. "You were what he needed. Whether by chance or design, your arrival was timely."

"I am grateful to have been useful."

"You continue to be useful. That is what matters." The old man rose. "Tomorrow, you begin tool restoration with Tanaka."

"Yes. Friday afternoon."

"Good. The skills you learn will serve you well in the repair shop. And the relationship with Tanaka will serve you well in the community. He is respected—his approval carries weight."

"I am fortunate to have received his offer."

"You earned his offer. Through patience, attention, and genuine interest in his craft. These are the currencies that matter here—more than money, more than background, more than mystery." Katsuhito moved toward the door. "The village is learning to trust you. Continue as you have begun, and that trust will grow."

---

The afternoon passed in quiet productivity.

Sheldon returned to his carpentry book, studying the chapters on tool maintenance with renewed attention. Tomorrow's session with Tanaka would be practical instruction, but theoretical understanding would help him learn more efficiently. He wanted to arrive prepared, to demonstrate that he valued the roofer's offer enough to invest effort before the teaching began.

The book described sharpening techniques in detail—the proper angles for different blade types, the progression of whetstones from coarse to fine, the signs that indicated correct and incorrect work. Some of the information connected to things Tanaka had mentioned during their previous conversations. Other details were new, expanding Sheldon's understanding of the principles involved.

Steel had memory, the book explained. Each sharpening session affected not just the immediate edge but the blade's long-term behavior. Proper technique maintained the steel's temper, preserved its ability to hold an edge. Improper technique—using the wrong angle, applying too much pressure, generating excessive heat—could damage the blade in ways that were difficult to reverse.

The parallel to other forms of care was not lost on Sheldon. Relationships had memory too. Each interaction affected not just the immediate moment but the long-term pattern. Consistent kindness, patient attention, reliable presence—these maintained the relationship's strength, its ability to endure stress. Inconsistency, impatience, neglect—these damaged in ways that were difficult to repair.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly as he read, the subtle enhancement that made learning easier, retention stronger. Whatever power had placed it there, it seemed to approve of his approach—acquiring knowledge through study, skills through practice, relationships through genuine engagement.

He thought about Nakamura-san's visit, about the village's observation, about the network of attention that surrounded him. In his previous life, such scrutiny would have made him uncomfortable. He had preferred anonymity, the freedom to exist without being noticed or judged. He had built walls around himself, maintained distance, avoided the entanglements that came with belonging to a community.

But here, the observation felt different. It was not surveillance but community—the natural awareness that arose when people lived together, depended on each other, shared their lives across generations. The village watched because it cared. It judged because its members' welfare depended on knowing who could be trusted.

And he was being trusted. Not fully, not yet—the mystery of his arrival remained. But his actions were speaking for him, building a reputation through accumulated evidence rather than claims or explanations. Each day that passed without incident, each interaction that demonstrated good character, each contribution to the community's wellbeing—all of it added to the weight of evidence in his favor.

This was how belonging worked, he was learning. Not through dramatic gestures or grand declarations, but through the steady accumulation of small choices. Each task completed properly, each interaction handled well, each day spent in genuine service—these were the bricks from which trust was built.

The process was slow. It required patience. It offered no shortcuts, no ways to accelerate the timeline. But it was solid, reliable, authentic. The trust that emerged from accumulated evidence was stronger than trust based on claims or appearances. It was earned rather than given, proven rather than assumed.

His grandmother had understood this. She had built her place in her community through decades of consistent behavior, through small kindnesses accumulated over years, through presence and reliability and care. When she died, the entire neighborhood had mourned—not because she had done anything dramatic, but because she had been there, day after day, year after year, a constant source of warmth in their lives.

Sheldon was trying to follow her example. Building rather than claiming. Earning rather than demanding. Trusting the process rather than seeking to control the outcome.

The kitten mewed from the mudroom, a small sound that might have been hunger or boredom or simple commentary. Sheldon set aside his book and went to check, finding the food dish empty and the small creature looking up at him expectantly.

"You have good timing," he said, refilling the dish. "Food is important, but so is making your needs known."

The kitten—Hikaru, though the name would not be official until evening—attacked the food with enthusiasm, apparently unconcerned with philosophical observations. Some things were more immediate than others.

Sheldon watched him eat, the small body hunched over the dish, the sounds of enthusiastic consumption filling the small room. This too was a form of trust, he realized. The kitten trusted that food would appear, that his needs would be met, that the strange new environment would provide for him.

Trust was everywhere, once you learned to see it. It was the fabric that held communities together, the invisible threads connecting person to person, creature to creature, moment to moment. Without trust, life became constant vigilance, exhausting watchfulness, isolation masquerading as safety.

The warmth hummed its quiet agreement.

Tenchi returned from school at the usual time.

The bus deposited him at the mountain's base, and he ran up the path with speed that suggested the day had felt very long indeed. His school bag bounced against his back, and his footsteps created a rapid rhythm on the stone path. He burst into the shrine grounds already calling for the kitten, as though worried the small creature might have vanished during his absence.

"He's in the mudroom," Sheldon said, intercepting him at the door. "He has eaten, played, slept, and played again. He is perfectly fine."

"I want to see him."

"Of course. But perhaps change out of your school clothes first? You will be more comfortable on the floor in play clothes, and your school uniform will last longer if it is not subjected to kitten interactions."

Tenchi considered this with visible impatience, weighing the logic against his overwhelming desire to see Hikaru immediately. Finally, he nodded.

"Okay. But fast."

The changing was indeed fast—a blur of motion that produced a boy in worn, comfortable clothing within minutes. His school uniform was deposited in a heap that would need attention later, but the priority was clear. Then he was gone, disappearing into the mudroom with the singular focus that characterized his current obsession.

Sheldon gave them privacy, attending to other tasks while the reunion unfolded. From the mudroom came the sounds of soft conversation—Tenchi narrating his day to an audience that probably did not understand the words but seemed to appreciate the attention.

"...and then Momoko said she wants to meet you, but I said you're too little for visitors yet. Maybe when you're bigger. And Kenji asked what I named you, and I said I was still deciding, and he said that was weird, but I said names matter so it's worth taking time. He doesn't understand because he's never had a pet. He has a little sister, but he says that's not the same. I think it might be kind of the same—you have to take care of both of them—but I didn't say that because I don't actually have a little sister so maybe I'm wrong..."

The monologue continued, a stream of school details and personal observations delivered to a kitten who occasionally mewed in response. It was, Sheldon realized, exactly what Tenchi needed—someone to tell things to, someone who would listen without judgment, someone whose presence was unconditional.

"...and in math we learned about bigger numbers. Like really big ones. The teacher said there are numbers so big you can't even think about them, which is kind of scary but also cool. I tried to imagine a number that big but my brain got tired. Maybe when I'm older I'll understand. Do cats understand numbers? Probably not big numbers. Maybe small ones, like how many treats you've had or how many times I've visited you today..."

The boy's voice was content, relaxed, different from how it had been in the early days after Sheldon's arrival. The careful distance was gone, replaced by the comfortable intimacy of someone who felt safe enough to ramble without purpose.

Dinner approached before Tenchi emerged, the kitten following at his heels for the first time.

"He walked with me! Without me carrying him! He just... followed!"

"Kittens bond to their primary person. He recognizes you as his, and wishes to be near you."

"That's so cool." Tenchi looked down at the small orange creature, who was examining the kitchen floor with intense curiosity. "Is he allowed in here?"

"For brief visits, supervised. He should not have free access yet—there are too many hazards for a young animal. But short explorations are acceptable."

The kitten navigated the kitchen carefully, sniffing chair legs and table supports, investigating corners and shadows. His territory was expanding, one small space at a time.

"Eventually he'll be able to go everywhere, right? When he's bigger?"

"Eventually, yes. But gradually. He must learn the boundaries, understand the dangers, develop the judgment to navigate complex spaces safely."

"Like me when I was little. Grandpa said he had to watch me all the time because I didn't understand what was dangerous."

"Exactly like that. Growing up is learning to be trusted with more freedom because you have demonstrated the wisdom to use it well."

Tenchi absorbed this, watching as the kitten completed his circuit and returned to sit at the boy's feet. "I'll teach him. Like you taught me about the fort, and patience, and stuff."

"That is an excellent parallel. You are now the teacher as well as the student."

"That's a lot of responsibility."

"It is. But you are ready for it. You have prepared, and you continue to prepare every day."

The kitten mewed, and Tenchi scooped him up carefully—supporting the hindquarters as he had been shown, cradling the small body against his chest. The purring began immediately.

"I think he agrees," Tenchi said.

---

Dinner featured Nakamura-san's mochi as dessert.

Katsuhito explained the significance of the gift as they ate—the community's tentative acceptance, the tradition of welcome offerings, the recipe passed through generations. The main course was simple but satisfying, rice and vegetables and grilled fish, the reliable foundation of household meals.

"Nakamura-san is respected in the village," Katsuhito said. "Her family has lived here for many generations—longer than most. When she offers an opinion, people listen. When she approves of someone, the village takes note."

"So she's like... the village judge?" Tenchi asked, his attention divided between the conversation and the mudroom door, where Hikaru had been returned after his kitchen adventure.

"In a way. Not formally—she holds no official position. But she observes carefully, speaks thoughtfully, and has earned trust through decades of fair dealing. When she brought mochi for Tsukino-san, she was signaling that the village has decided to accept him."

"That's good." Tenchi bit into a piece of mochi with satisfaction, the soft rice cake yielding to his teeth. "Everyone should accept Tsukino-san. He's really nice."

"The village is learning this. It takes time for communities to accept outsiders, to trust people who arrive from elsewhere. Tsukino-san has been patient with the process, which is itself a sign of good character."

"Like the kitten." Tenchi's eyes brightened as he made the connection. "Hikaru had to learn to trust us too. First he was in the carrier, and he didn't know where he was going. Then he was in the mudroom, and he didn't know if he was safe. And now he follows me around and purrs. Trust takes time."

"That is an excellent parallel."

"But it's worth the time, right? Because now Hikaru really trusts me. Not fake trust, but real trust. The kind that comes from knowing someone."

"Yes. Trust that is earned through experience is stronger than trust given freely. It has been tested, proven, confirmed by evidence. It is resilient because it is based on knowledge rather than assumption."

Tenchi nodded, chewing thoughtfully. "So when people trust Tsukino-san, it'll be real trust. Because he earned it."

"Precisely."

The parallel was apt, and Sheldon felt something warm expand in his chest that was not entirely the mysterious power. It was simpler than that—gratitude, perhaps, or affection. The boy's willingness to see connections, to apply lessons across contexts, to grow in understanding. To explain complex social dynamics through the lens of a kitten's trust.

"You are becoming wise," Sheldon said.

Tenchi grinned, a spot of sweet bean paste from the mochi visible at the corner of his mouth. "I'm practicing. Like everything else. Wisdom is just practice, right? Like patience. Like building forts. Like taking care of Hikaru."

"That is... yes. That is exactly right."

"Mom used to say that too. She said being good at stuff was just about doing it a lot. Even kindness—she said kindness was a skill, and you got better at it by practicing." His expression shifted slightly, the familiar touch of grief that accompanied mentions of his mother. "I try to remember the things she taught me. So I can keep practicing them."

"You remember her well."

"I don't want to forget. Sometimes I worry that I'll forget things. Important things. Like what her voice sounded like, or how she smelled, or..." He trailed off, the mochi forgotten in his hand.

"You will not forget the important things. They are part of you now—woven into who you are. The specific details may fade, but the essence remains." Sheldon spoke carefully, aware of the delicate territory. "And you can ask your grandfather about the details. He remembers too."

Katsuhito nodded. "Whenever you want to talk about her, I am here. I have many stories I have not yet told you—things from before you were born, things she might not have told you herself."

"Really? What kind of things?"

"Stories for another time. When you are ready to hear them." The old man's voice was gentle. "For now, finish your mochi. It is getting late."

Tenchi complied, though his expression suggested that "another time" might not come soon enough. The hunger for connection to his mother was always present, sometimes dormant, sometimes acute. Tonight it had surfaced briefly before retreating again.

---

The evening followed its new pattern.

Tenchi spent time with the kitten in the mudroom, playing and talking and building the bond that would last for years. The small creature was becoming accustomed to his person's presence, relaxing more fully, playing more confidently, sleeping more deeply when Tenchi was near.

The transformation from the first day was already visible. The kitten no longer startled at sudden sounds. He no longer investigated every corner with suspicious vigilance. He no longer positioned himself for quick retreat when people entered the room. Instead, he oriented toward Tenchi, tracked the boy's movements, sought proximity rather than distance.

"I think I've decided," Tenchi said, when Sheldon came to remind him about bath time. "About the name."

"And?"

"Hikaru. Like in the dream." He looked down at the kitten, who was drowsing in his lap, a small orange weight that rose and fell with steady breathing. "He's my light. Everything is brighter because he's here. So Hikaru is perfect."

"Hikaru," Sheldon repeated, testing the name. The sounds fit naturally together, flowed easily from the tongue. "It suits him."

"I know. It took me a while to be sure, but now I am. I thought about all the other names—Hinata and Taiyou and the others—but Hikaru kept coming back. It's like... it was always his name. I just had to find it."

"Some names are discovered rather than invented. They already belong to their owners, waiting to be recognized."

"Yeah! That's exactly how it feels." Tenchi stroked the orange fur gently, his touch light and careful. "Hikaru. Your name is Hikaru."

The newly-named kitten opened one eye, regarded Tenchi for a moment with the sleepy assessment of a creature disturbed from comfortable rest. Then he closed it again, apparently satisfied that nothing urgent required his attention. The name was acceptable. The situation was stable. Sleep could continue.

"Welcome to the family, Hikaru," Tenchi whispered. "We're going to have the best life together. I'm going to take care of you forever. I'm going to make sure you're never scared or lonely or hungry. I'm going to be the best owner any cat ever had."

The promises were extravagant, the kind children made before understanding how long forever really was. But they were sincere—Tenchi meant every word, felt every commitment in his heart. And that sincerity mattered more than the practical impossibility of perfection.

"He is fortunate to have you," Sheldon said.

"I'm fortunate to have him. We're fortunate to have each other." Tenchi looked up, his eyes bright. "That's how love works, right? Both people are lucky?"

"Yes. When love is mutual, both parties benefit. The giving and receiving become intertwined until they are inseparable."

"Like you and me and Grandpa. We all take care of each other, so we're all lucky."

"That is an excellent way to describe it."

Tenchi smiled, the expression carrying contentment and belonging and the particular joy of a child who knows he is loved. "I have a lot of people now. And one cat. That's a whole family."

"It is. A whole family indeed."

---

Bath time and bedtime proceeded smoothly.

Tenchi was tired from the emotional intensity of the past days, and sleep claimed him quickly once he lay down. The kitten—Hikaru now, properly named—was settled in his mudroom bed, and the house was quiet.

On the engawa, Katsuhito and Sheldon sat together as had become their habit.

The night was clear, stars visible through gaps in the trees, the sounds of the mountain creating their gentle symphony. From the house came the faint sounds of settling—Tenchi in his bed, Hikaru in the mudroom, the wooden structure adjusting to the cool of evening.

"He named the kitten," Katsuhito observed. "That is progress."

"Hikaru. Light. Because the kitten makes everything brighter."

"A good name. Meaningful to him, connected to his experience." The old man was quiet for a moment. "Naming is important. It marks ownership, responsibility, commitment. By naming the kitten, Tenchi has formally accepted his role as its guardian."

"He has been preparing for weeks. The naming is simply the final step."

"Yes. But final steps matter. They mark transitions, complete processes, enable what comes next. The fort was an idea until the last wall was placed. The kitten was a visitor until it received a name. Each completion opens a door to new possibilities." Katsuhito's eyes were on the stars. "Tomorrow you begin with Tanaka. That is another kind of transition—from student of theory to practitioner of craft."

"I am ready. Or as ready as I can be."

"Readiness is a process, not a state. You are ready enough to begin, and you will become more ready as you practice." The old man shifted slightly, adjusting his position. "Tanaka is a good teacher. Patient, thorough, demanding of correct technique. He will not let you develop bad habits."

"That is valuable. Bad habits are easier to prevent than to correct."

"Yes. The patterns we establish early tend to persist. Better to learn correctly from the start than to spend years unlearning mistakes." A pause. "This is true of more than tool maintenance. It is true of character as well."

"You are speaking of Tenchi."

"I am speaking of everyone. But yes, especially of Tenchi. He is young, still forming. The patterns he learns now will shape who he becomes. The way he treats his kitten, the way he approaches responsibility, the way he handles disappointment—all of this becomes part of his character."

"He seems to be learning good patterns."

"He is. Thanks in part to your influence. You model patience, consistency, genuine attention. He observes and absorbs, even when you do not realize you are teaching."

"I try to be conscious of the example I set."

"Consciousness helps, but it is not everything. Character shows through in unguarded moments, in the small choices that seem to have no audience. Tenchi sees these moments. All children do. They are remarkably perceptive about the gaps between what adults say and what adults do."

"Then I must ensure my actions match my words."

"You already do. That is why I trust you with him." The old man rose slowly. "Eighteen days. You have accomplished much."

"With help. None of it would have been possible without the generosity of others—you, Tanaka, Hashimoto, the villagers who have accepted me despite my strangeness."

"That is true of all accomplishment. No one achieves anything alone—we are all supported by networks of help, visible and invisible. The farmer is supported by the toolmaker, the toolmaker by the miner, the miner by the farmer who feeds him. Everything connects." Katsuhito moved toward the door. "The skill is recognizing the help when it comes, and being grateful for it. You have demonstrated both."

"I am learning."

"You are. And that is the point." The old man paused at the threshold. "Tomorrow begins new learning. Rest well. Tanaka will expect your full attention."

"I will be ready."

"I know you will."

He disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars.

Eighteen days. A kitten named, a village accepting, a tomorrow bringing new learning. The life he was building continued to grow, each day adding another layer, another connection, another piece of the emerging whole.

The warmth hummed in his chest, quiet and constant. Whatever power it represented, it seemed satisfied with the progress being made. With the relationships deepening, the skills developing, the trust accumulating through accumulated evidence.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Tomorrow would bring tool restoration with Tanaka. Another step, another skill, another relationship deepening. The pattern continued, the building proceeded, the life took shape.

Eighteen days down.

The building continued.

## Day 19

---

## Friday, April 21, 1989

---

The morning began with a name.

"Good morning, Hikaru," Tenchi whispered, already at the mudroom door when Sheldon emerged from his room. The boy had learned to move quietly in the pre-dawn hours, navigating the house without disturbing others. "Did you sleep well?"

The orange kitten stretched in his bed, the movement revealing how much he had already grown in the few days since his arrival. Kittens changed quickly at this age—each day bringing small developments that accumulated into rapid transformation.

"He seems content," Sheldon observed, joining Tenchi at the doorway.

"He purrs every morning now. When he first wakes up and sees me." Tenchi's voice carried wonder at this simple fact. "Before he even gets out of bed. Just seeing me makes him happy."

"You are learning what it means to be someone's person."

"It feels important. Like... like I matter to him in a way I've never mattered to anything before."

"That is the weight of being loved. The responsibility that comes with it."

Tenchi nodded slowly, his attention still on Hikaru. "It's a good weight, though. Not heavy like when you're carrying something. Heavy like when something matters."

The distinction was apt. Sheldon filed it away, another example of the boy's growing capacity for nuance.

---

Breakfast was quieter than usual.

Tenchi ate with steady efficiency, his mind apparently occupied with thoughts he did not voice. Hikaru had been fed and settled, the morning routine already becoming automatic. In just three days, the kitten's needs had integrated into the household's rhythms.

The orange kitten had eaten his morning meal with enthusiasm, then retired to his bed for the first nap of the day. His pattern was becoming predictable: wake, eat, play, sleep, repeat. The simple cycle of a young creature whose needs were being met, whose world was small and safe and complete.

"Today is the tool restoration," Katsuhito observed, addressing Sheldon. "With Tanaka."

"This afternoon, yes. After lunch."

"You have prepared?"

"I studied the relevant chapters in the carpentry book. The theory of sharpening, the progression of whetstones, the signs of correct technique." Sheldon paused, considering what he had learned. "The process is more complex than I initially understood. Each type of tool requires different angles, different approaches. The steel itself varies—harder steels hold edges longer but are more difficult to sharpen. Softer steels are easier to work but dull more quickly."

"You have absorbed the theory well."

"Though I understand that practical instruction will differ from theoretical reading. The body must learn what the mind has understood."

"It will. But the theory provides a framework for the practice. You will learn faster because you have prepared." The old man sipped his tea, the morning light catching the steam rising from his cup. "Tanaka will appreciate this. He has little patience for students who arrive expecting to be taught from nothing."

"I have noticed that the craftsmen here value preparation. It seems to be part of the culture of learning."

"It is respect. For the teacher's time, for the skill being transmitted, for the tradition that carries the knowledge forward." Katsuhito set down his cup. "You will be working with Hideo's tools. This has significance beyond the practical."

"Tanaka mentioned that Hideo was his friend."

"They worked together for many years. Built houses, repaired structures, taught younger craftsmen. Their partnership was well-known in the village—when a project required two sets of hands, everyone knew to hire them together." The old man's expression carried something unreadable. "Restoring those tools will be meaningful to Tanaka. He is honoring his friend through you."

"I will try to be worthy of that honor."

"You already are. That is why he offered." Katsuhito's eyes met Sheldon's with unexpected directness. "Tanaka is not sentimental. He does not make offers lightly. If he has chosen to share this work with you, it is because he sees something in you worth investing in."

"I hope I do not disappoint him."

"You will not. Of that I am certain."

---

The morning's shrine work proceeded with its usual rhythm.

Sheldon swept the paths, tended the water basins, performed the small maintenance tasks that kept the grounds in proper order. The cherry blossom season was fully over now—the trees wore their summer green, lush and full, a different kind of beauty than the fleeting pink of spring.

Ishikawa was present at his usual station.

"Good morning," Sheldon said. "The kitten has a name now. Hikaru. Light."

The frog blinked, apparently unmoved by this information.

"Tenchi chose it based on a dream. He said the name was always there, waiting to be discovered." Sheldon changed the water with practiced movements. "I wonder if names work that way for all creatures. If somewhere, in some sense, your true name already exists. If Ishikawa is correct, or if there is another name that would suit you better."

The frog offered no opinion on the matter of names.

"Perhaps names matter less to frogs. Perhaps you are content to simply be what you are, without the human need for labels and categories."

Ishikawa hopped into the fresh water, which might have been agreement or might have been the simple pursuit of comfort. The frog's motivations remained opaque.

"Enjoy your day," Sheldon said. "I am learning tool restoration this afternoon. A new skill to add to the collection."

The frog settled onto its rock, apparently wishing him well in its own inscrutable way.

---

Tenchi departed for school with visible reluctance.

"I want to stay home and play with Hikaru," he said, lingering at the door.

"School is not optional. And Hikaru will still be here when you return."

"I know. But now that he has a name, I want to use it. I want to say 'Hikaru' a hundred times so he really learns it."

"He will learn it through repetition over time. A few hours of school will not slow that process."

Tenchi sighed, the exaggerated exhale of a child accepting an unwanted truth. "Okay. But I'm going to think about him all day."

"That is your prerogative. Though I suspect your teacher would prefer you also think about your lessons."

"I can do both. Brains can think about more than one thing."

"True. But attention is limited. The more you think about Hikaru, the less attention remains for other things."

"Maybe thinking about Hikaru will help me pay attention to lessons. Like, I'll be so happy that I'll learn better."

The logic was creative, if not entirely sound. Sheldon chose not to argue. "Perhaps. We shall see what your teacher reports."

The bus horn sounded, and Tenchi departed with a final wave. His footsteps on the path were quicker than they had been in the early days—the steps of a child who had somewhere to return to, someone waiting for him.

---

Lunch was simple, eaten in anticipation of the afternoon.

Katsuhito had prepared rice and vegetables, the reliable foundation of most meals. They ate in comfortable silence, each occupied with their own thoughts.

"I have been thinking about the house," Sheldon said. "About the repair shop."

"And?"

"Hashimoto's work will establish the main room. Once the tatami is replaced, the space will be usable. I could begin accepting small repairs even before the other restoration is complete."

"That is sensible. The village has needs that are not being met. Starting early would serve both you and the community."

"I would need to acquire some basic equipment. Tools, supplies, a workbench."

"Tanaka may have suggestions. He knows the suppliers, understands what quality is worth paying for." Katsuhito finished his rice and set down the bowl. "Speak with him today, if the opportunity arises. He will appreciate being consulted."

"I will."

"And Sheldon—" The use of his given name caught attention; Katsuhito typically used the formal surname. "Do not rush. The repair shop will happen when it is meant to happen. The village has waited this long; it can wait a little longer."

"I am not rushing. I am planning."

"Good. Planning is appropriate. Rushing is not." The old man rose from the table. "I will practice calligraphy while you are with Tanaka. Report on your progress when you return."

"I will."

---

The walk to Tanaka's workshop took fifteen minutes.

The afternoon was warm, the spring sun strong enough to raise a light sweat. Sheldon carried Hideo's tools in their cloth bundle, the weight familiar now after multiple trips between the shrine and the village. Birds sang in the trees lining the path, and the sounds of village life grew louder as he approached.

Tanaka's workshop was open when Sheldon arrived, the roofer visible inside arranging materials on his workbench. He looked up at Sheldon's approach and nodded once, a gesture of acknowledgment and welcome.

"You are punctual. Good." He gestured to a stool beside the workbench. "Sit. We will begin with the basics."

Sheldon settled onto the stool and unwrapped the tools, spreading them across the available surface. The collection looked different in this context—not just objects to be transported, but teachers waiting to impart their lessons.

"You have studied the theory," Tanaka said. It was not a question.

"The carpentry book. Chapters on sharpening and tool maintenance."

"Show me what you remember."

Sheldon described the principles as he understood them: the progression from coarse to fine whetstones, the importance of consistent angles, the signs of correct and incorrect technique. He spoke carefully, aware that this was a test of both knowledge and humility.

Tanaka listened without interrupting, his expression giving nothing away. When Sheldon finished, the roofer nodded slowly.

"You have learned the words. Now we will teach your hands."

He selected a chisel from Hideo's collection—one with a blade that had grown dull through disuse, its edge no longer capable of the clean cuts it once made.

"This was Hideo's favorite for fine work. He could shave wood so thin you could see through it." Tanaka turned the chisel in his hands, examining it with the attention of someone reading a familiar text. The handle was worn smooth by decades of use, the wood darkened where Hideo's grip had polished it. "The steel is good. The handle is sound. Only the edge has failed, and that we can restore."

He set the chisel down and arranged his whetstones in a row—five of them, progressing from rough to mirror-smooth. Each stone had its place in the sequence, its specific role in the transformation from dull to sharp.

"We begin here." He indicated the coarsest stone, its surface rough enough to feel through fingertips. "This stone removes material quickly, establishes the basic angle. It is aggressive—too aggressive if used improperly. But it is necessary. Without it, the finer stones cannot do their work."

He demonstrated the proper positioning: the stone set at a slight angle, wetted with water from a nearby basin, the chisel held with specific finger placement.

"The angle is everything. For this type of chisel, we use twenty-five degrees. Other tools require different angles—planes are often thirty, knives can be fifteen or even less. The angle determines how the edge will cut, how long it will last, how it will respond to different materials."

"How do you maintain the angle consistently?"

"Practice. Thousands of repetitions until your body knows the angle without your mind's involvement." Tanaka positioned the chisel against the stone. "But there are also guides you can use while learning. I will show you those as well."

He drew the chisel across the stone with steady pressure, the motion originating from his shoulder rather than his wrist. The sound was distinctive—a rhythmic scraping that seemed to have its own music, a frequency that changed as the steel met different parts of the stone.

"You see the motion. Not pushing, but drawing. The weight of the tool provides the pressure. Force is the enemy of good sharpening."

"Why?"

"Force creates heat. Heat damages the steel's temper. The blade becomes soft, loses its ability to hold an edge." Tanaka continued the demonstration, each stroke identical to the last. "Patience achieves what force cannot. This is true of sharpening. It is true of most things."

He completed several more strokes, then paused to show Sheldon the blade. A slight burr had formed on one side—evidence that the stone was doing its work.

"You see this? The burr indicates that you have sharpened past the edge. It is necessary but temporary. We will remove it in later stages."

The demonstration continued, Tanaka explaining each element of the technique: how to check the angle by feel, how to maintain even pressure across the stroke, how to know when one stone had done its work and the next should begin.

"Hideo could sharpen a chisel in ten minutes. It took him fifty years to achieve that speed. You will take longer, and that is appropriate."

He handed the chisel and stone to Sheldon.

"Now you."

---

The first attempts were clumsy.

Sheldon's angle wavered, his pressure inconsistent. The stone did its work, but the results were uneven—sections properly sharpened adjacent to sections barely touched.

"Your wrist is moving," Tanaka observed. "Lock it. The motion comes from the arm, not the hand."

Sheldon adjusted, trying to isolate the correct muscles. The next stroke was better, the following one better still.

"Again. The pattern will come."

He repeated the motion, focusing on consistency. Each stroke taught something—about pressure, about angle, about the feel of steel meeting stone. The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, its subtle enhancement making the learning faster, the muscle memory more reliable.

"Better," Tanaka said after several minutes. "You are finding the rhythm."

"It feels... meditative. Once the motion becomes automatic."

"That is the goal. When you no longer think about the technique, the technique can work through you." The roofer examined Sheldon's progress, turning the chisel to check the evenness of the edge. "You are ready for the next stone."

He produced a medium-grit whetstone, its surface smoother than the first. "This refines what the coarse stone established. Removes the scratches, prepares the edge for final polishing."

The demonstration continued, each stage building on the last. Tanaka explained the theory behind the practice—how each grit level created finer scratches, how the final polishing removed all visible marks, how a properly sharpened edge reflected light in a specific way.

"Hideo taught me some of this," the roofer said, during a pause in the instruction. "When I was young and thought I knew everything. He was patient with my arrogance."

"You were friends for a long time."

"Since childhood. We grew up on adjacent farms, went to school together, learned our trades together." Tanaka's voice carried the weight of decades. "When he married, I stood with him. When his daughter was born, I was the first outside the family to hold her."

"Kiyone."

"Yes. She was a remarkable child. Curious about everything, always asking questions. Hideo said she would either become a great scholar or drive everyone around her mad with her inquiries." A slight smile touched his features. "She became both, in her way."

"You knew her well."

"As well as an uncle might. Not by blood, but by bond." Tanaka returned his attention to the tools. "When she died, something in Hideo broke. The questions stopped making sense to him. He put away his tools and never picked them up again."

"And now I am restoring them."

"Now you are restoring them. Bringing them back to life, as we could not bring him back." The roofer met Sheldon's eyes. "This matters to me. I want you to understand that."

"I understand."

"Good. Then continue. We have more to do."

---

The afternoon deepened as the work continued.

Sheldon progressed through the whetstones, each one teaching new lessons about pressure and patience. The chisel's edge transformed gradually—from dull and ineffective to gleaming and sharp, capable once again of the work it had been made for.

"Feel this," Tanaka said, handing him the finished chisel. "Run your thumb along the edge—carefully."

Sheldon obeyed, feeling the transition from flat to sharp with delicate touch. The edge was invisible at this angle, thin beyond perception, capable of cutting with minimal pressure.

"That is what correct sharpening achieves. The edge becomes so fine that it seems to disappear." Tanaka nodded with satisfaction. "You have done well for a first attempt."

"The warmth—" Sheldon caught himself, unsure how to explain. "The work becomes absorbing. Time passes without notice."

"That is how it should be. The best work comes from that state—when the mind quiets and the hands know what to do." The roofer began arranging the next set of tools. "We will do two more today. A plane blade and a saw. Different shapes, different techniques, same principles."

The plane blade required a different angle, the sharpening motion adapted to its curved surface. Tanaka demonstrated with the same patience, explaining the variations while Sheldon watched and learned.

"Hideo's planes were his pride," the roofer said. "He could read a board by the sound it made under the blade. Knew exactly how the wood would behave before he finished the first stroke."

"That level of skill takes years to develop."

"Decades. And even then, the learning continues. The day you think you have mastered a skill is the day you begin to lose it." Tanaka handed over the plane blade. "Humility is not just a virtue. It is a requirement."

Sheldon worked on the plane blade, applying the lessons from the chisel while adapting to the new shape. The rhythm came more easily now, his body remembering what his mind had learned.

"You are a quick study," Tanaka observed. "Quicker than most."

"I have good teachers."

"Teaching only works when the student is receptive. You bring willingness and attention. Those cannot be taught." Tanaka examined Sheldon's progress on the plane blade, testing the edge with expert fingers. "Good. You have found the correct angle. Now maintain it through the finer stones."

The work continued, each whetstone adding refinement to the edge. By the time Sheldon reached the finest stone—a smooth slab that felt almost soft to the touch—the blade was beginning to gleam.

"This final stage is polishing," Tanaka explained. "The edge is already sharp, but we refine it further. Remove the last scratches. Create a surface that reflects light cleanly."

The motions were the same, but the sensation was different. The finest stone offered almost no resistance, the blade gliding across its surface like silk on glass. The sound changed too—quieter, almost musical.

"When you finish, the edge should look like a mirror. No scratches visible, no imperfections in the steel."

Sheldon completed the polishing and examined his work. The edge caught the light, reflecting it cleanly. Not quite a mirror, but approaching it.

"Acceptable," Tanaka said, which Sheldon was learning meant genuine approval. "Now the saw. A different challenge entirely."

The saw was unlike the other tools. Its edge was not a single continuous line but a series of teeth, each one requiring individual attention. The technique was adapted accordingly—shorter strokes, a specialized file instead of a whetstone, attention to the set of the teeth as well as their sharpness.

"Saw sharpening is its own discipline," Tanaka explained. "Some craftsmen specialize in nothing else. They travel from village to village, sharpening every saw they encounter."

"A traveling sharpener?"

"It was more common in the past. Now most people replace dull saws rather than restore them. The skill is dying." Tanaka positioned the saw in a special vise that held it firmly while allowing access to the teeth. "But for good saws—quality steel, proper construction—restoration is worth the effort."

He demonstrated the filing technique, drawing the file across each tooth in sequence. "The angle here is different. We match the original cut of the tooth, restore what has worn away without changing the saw's character."

"Each saw has a character?"

"Each saw is unique. The spacing of the teeth, the set, the angle of the cut—these vary by maker, by era, by intended purpose. A saw for cutting across the grain differs from one for cutting with it. A saw for fine work differs from one for rough work." Tanaka completed a row of teeth and moved to the next. "Hideo understood his saws intimately. He could tell you the maker of each one, where he acquired it, what jobs it had done."

"You speak of him with great affection."

"He was my closest friend. Closer than brothers, in some ways. Brothers share blood; we shared work, which is a different kind of bond." The file moved steadily, stroke after stroke. "When you work beside someone for decades, you learn their soul. You see them in moments of frustration and triumph, exhaustion and satisfaction. You know their patience and their temper, their skills and their limitations."

"That sounds like a form of love."

"It is. Not romantic, not familial, but love nonetheless. The love of shared purpose, of work done together, of lives intertwined through common effort." Tanaka set down the file and gestured for Sheldon to take it. "Your turn. Remember—match the original angle. Do not force the file. Let the teeth guide you."

Sheldon took up the file and began working on the next row of teeth. The motion was unfamiliar, but the principles were the same. Patience over force. Consistency over speed. Attention to what the tool was telling him.

"Better than I expected for a first attempt," Tanaka said, after watching several strokes. "You have the instinct. Now you need the practice."

The work continued, the afternoon light shifting as the sun moved across the sky. By the time they finished the saw, Sheldon's hands had found their confidence. The motions were becoming natural, the technique embedding itself in muscle memory.

"Enough for today," Tanaka finally said. "We have made good progress."

The tools lay on the workbench, three of them now restored—the chisel, the plane blade, the saw. Each one gleamed with renewed purpose, ready once again to do the work it had been made for.

"When do we continue?"

"Next Friday. Same time. We will work through the collection, one session at a time." Tanaka began wrapping the restored tools in fresh cloth. "Take these with you. They are yours now."

"They were Hideo's."

"And now they are yours. That is how tools work—they serve one master, then another, carrying knowledge forward through generations." The roofer completed his wrapping and handed the bundle to Sheldon. "Use them well. Honor what they represent."

"I will try."

"I know you will. That is why I offered."

---

The walk back to the shrine was contemplative.

Sheldon carried the tools with new appreciation, understanding now what they represented. Not just metal and wood shaped for function, but vessels of tradition, carriers of knowledge, connections to craftsmen no longer living.

The path through the village was familiar now, each landmark recognized without conscious thought. The baker's house with its perpetual smell of warm bread. The small shrine at the crossroads where travelers once paused to pray for safe journeys. The ancient maple tree that shaded the intersection, its branches spreading wide enough to shelter a dozen people from rain.

Hideo had walked this path, carrying these same tools. His feet had worn the same stones, his eyes had seen the same landmarks. For decades, he had moved between home and work, project and project, contributing to the village's physical fabric through the labor of his hands.

And now his tools were Sheldon's. Not owned, exactly—stewardship felt more accurate. He was caring for them until they passed to someone else, another link in the chain that stretched back centuries and would continue for centuries more.

The concept was humbling in its scope. These tools predated his existence; they would outlast it. He was merely a temporary custodian, charged with maintaining their function during his time, passing them on improved to whoever came next.

The village was quiet as he passed through, the afternoon work giving way to evening preparations. Smoke rose from chimneys, the smell of cooking filling the air. Families gathered, children played, the daily rhythm continued its eternal pattern.

He belonged here now. Not fully, not completely—the mystery of his arrival still lingered. But the practical belonging was established. He was part of the village's network of relationships, recognized and accepted, trusted with the tools of a dead man.

The warmth in his chest hummed its quiet approval.

---

The shrine was peaceful when he returned.

Katsuhito sat on the engawa, tea before him, the day's calligraphy practice apparently complete. His fingers still bore ink stains, the marks of effort that never fully washed away. Before him lay several sheets of practice paper, the characters ranging from hesitant to confident.

"How did it go?" the old man asked.

"Well, I think. Tanaka is a patient teacher." Sheldon set the tool bundle on the engawa and unwrapped it to show the restored pieces. "Three tools sharpened. We continue next Friday."

Katsuhito examined the chisel first, testing the edge with a careful thumb. His movements suggested familiarity with such assessments—perhaps from his own youth, before the shrine consumed all his time.

"This is good work. The angle is correct, the edge uniform. The burr has been removed cleanly." He set down the chisel and examined the plane blade next, tilting it to catch the light. "You can see your reflection in this one. That indicates proper polishing."

"Tanaka guided every stroke."

"But your hands did the work. The skill is becoming yours." He set down the plane blade and looked at Sheldon directly. "He told you about Hideo."

"Some. Their friendship, their shared history. How Hideo stopped working after Kiyone died."

"That grief destroyed him, slowly. He was a man of action, of work—his hands needed to be busy or his mind turned inward. When he could no longer work, he had nothing to distract him from the pain." Katsuhito's voice carried the weight of observation, of watching a friend fade. "He would sit for hours, staring at nothing. We tried to reach him, but he had gone somewhere we could not follow."

"You knew him as well."

"Everyone in the village knew Hideo. He built half the houses here, repaired the other half. When something needed doing, he was the one who did it—not for payment, not for recognition, but because he could not bear to see things broken when they could be fixed." Katsuhito's voice carried admiration and sorrow in equal measure. "The village lost something when he withdrew. A kind of capability that could not be replaced."

"Until now?"

"Perhaps. You are not Hideo—you have your own gifts, your own approach. But you are filling a similar role. The person who fixes what is broken, who maintains what exists, who keeps the material world functional." He gestured at the restored tools. "And you are doing it with his tools, which carries its own meaning."

"That is what I hope to become."

"That is what you are becoming. The process is already underway. Today's work is evidence of that—not just the sharpening itself, but what it represents. You are taking up a role the village needs, using tools that carry history, learning skills that have value beyond their immediate application."

---

Tenchi returned from school full of energy.

He burst through the door with news about his day—a game played at recess, a lesson about animals, a friend who had brought a grasshopper to class in a jar.

"And then the teacher made him let it go, but he was really upset because he wanted to keep it, but she said grasshoppers don't belong in jars, they belong in fields, and I thought about Hikaru and how he belongs here with us, not in a shelter or a pet store or anywhere else—"

The stream of consciousness continued as Tenchi changed out of his school clothes and headed for the mudroom. Hikaru greeted him with the enthusiasm that had become routine, standing at the door, tail raised, ready for attention.

"Hi Hikaru! Did you miss me? I thought about you all day. In math I was adding numbers but I was also thinking about you. And in reading I was reading about a cat, which made me think about you even more—"

Sheldon watched from a distance, smiling at the intensity of the connection. In just four days, the kitten had become central to Tenchi's emotional landscape. The boy had someone to care for, someone who needed him, someone whose happiness depended on his attention.

"Tsukino-san?" Tenchi's voice came from the mudroom. "Can Hikaru come in the kitchen while we make dinner?"

"For a short visit, supervised."

"Good. I want him to learn the house. All of it. So he knows everywhere is his home."

The gradual expansion of territory was proceeding as planned. Hikaru's world was growing, one room at a time, one supervised visit at a time. Eventually, he would have access to the entire house, moving freely as a full member of the household.

But for now, boundaries remained. Learning to respect limits was as important as learning to explore.

---

Dinner was rice and grilled fish, simple and satisfying.

Hikaru sat on Tenchi's lap for part of the meal, then was returned to the mudroom when his interest in the fish became too pointed. The kitten's hunting instincts did not distinguish between prey and dinner.

"He's so smart," Tenchi said, watching Hikaru's interest in the fish with admiration rather than frustration. "He knew exactly what he wanted."

"Cats are efficient predators. Their focus on potential food is instinctive."

"That's good, right? It means he'll be good at catching mice when he's bigger."

"Potentially. Though he may find that regular meals reduce his motivation for hunting."

"I'll still play hunting games with him. With the mouse toy. So he remembers how."

The logic was sound. Play would maintain the instincts even if hunting became unnecessary.

"Tsukino-san learned how to sharpen tools today," Katsuhito informed Tenchi. "With Tanaka-san."

"Really? What kind of tools?"

"Chisels and planes and saws. The tools that belonged to your great-grandfather."

Tenchi's expression shifted, processing this connection. "Hideo? Mom's grandfather?"

"Yes. His tools are being restored so they can be used again."

"That's cool." Tenchi considered for a moment. "So when Tsukino-san uses them, it's like... like Hideo is helping?"

"In a way, yes. The tools carry his knowledge, his skill. Using them properly honors what he created."

"Like when I use Mom's recipe for rice balls. Grandpa showed me how she made them, and now when I make them, it's like she's helping too."

The parallel was beautiful in its simplicity. Knowledge transmitted through action, presence maintained through practice.

"Exactly like that," Sheldon said.

---

The evening passed in comfortable routine.

Tenchi played with Hikaru until bath time, then submitted to the necessary hygiene with minimal complaint. The kitten was settled in his mudroom bed, the nightly separation no longer producing protest.

"He's getting used to sleeping alone," Tenchi observed, during bedtime preparations. "He doesn't cry anymore when I leave."

"He is learning that you return. Each morning confirms the pattern, builds his trust that separation is temporary."

"That's good. I want him to feel safe even when I'm not there."

"He does. Because you have been consistent. Reliable. Present when you said you would be."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this assessment. He climbed into his futon with Usagi-chan, the routine as established as breathing.

"Tsukino-san?"

"Yes?"

"The tools. The ones from Hideo. Are they really important?"

"They are important in several ways. They are useful—they can do work that needs doing. They are historical—they connect us to someone who is no longer here. And they are symbolic—they represent the continuation of skill across generations."

"That's a lot of importance for some tools."

"Objects accumulate importance through use and meaning. A new tool has only potential. An old tool, well-used and well-maintained, has history."

Tenchi considered this, his expression thoughtful. "Like Usagi-chan. She's important because Mom gave her to me and I've had her since I was a baby. A new stuffed rabbit wouldn't be the same."

"Exactly. The object is the same in physical terms—fabric and stuffing. But the meaning is different. The history makes it irreplaceable."

"So when I give Hikaru toys, they'll become important too. Because of our history together."

"Yes. Each object you share will carry the weight of your relationship. Years from now, a worn-out mouse toy might mean more than a new one."

"I'll keep all his toys. Even when they're old. So we remember."

"That is a good practice."

Tenchi smiled, settling deeper into his futon. "Goodnight, Tsukino-san. Thank you for explaining about tools and history and stuff."

"Goodnight, Tenchi. Dream of kittens and sharpened edges."

The boy laughed softly, the sound trailing into sleep.

---

On the engawa, the stars were bright.

Katsuhito had already retired, leaving Sheldon alone with the night and his thoughts. The day's work lingered in his muscles—not soreness exactly, but the awareness of effort expended, skills practiced, progress made.

Three tools sharpened. Three pieces of Hideo's legacy restored. The work would continue, Friday by Friday, until the entire collection was renewed.

His hands still remembered the feeling of the stones—the roughness of the coarse whetstone, the smoothness of the fine one, the way the steel had responded to each stage of the process. The muscle memory was forming, the neural pathways being laid down that would eventually make the motions automatic.

This was how skills were built. Not through reading, not through watching, but through doing. The body had to learn, had to make mistakes and correct them, had to repeat the motions until they became second nature. There was no shortcut, no way to accelerate the process beyond the incremental improvement that came from practice.

And then what? The repair shop would open, the tools would find new purpose, the village would have someone to fix what was broken. The cycle would continue—objects wearing out, skills being applied, functionality being restored.

This was what he was meant to do here. Not grand adventures or dramatic interventions, but quiet service. The steady work of maintenance, the patient attention to things that needed care. A life built from accumulated small contributions rather than singular achievements.

His previous self would have found this inadequate. That Sheldon had measured worth in publications and citations, in recognition and acclaim. He had sought significance through achievement, importance through accomplishment. The idea of spending years sharpening tools and fixing radios would have seemed like a waste of his abilities.

But that path had led to a lonely death in an empty office, mourned by no one who knew him well, leaving no lasting impact despite decades of effort. The papers he had published were already fading into obscurity, their contributions absorbed into the field without attribution. The theories he had developed had been refined and superseded by others who built on his work without remembering his name.

This path was different. It led to community, to connection, to the kind of significance that came from being needed by the people around you. A repaired radio might not seem important in the grand scheme of things, but to the family whose connection to the wider world depended on it, the repair mattered enormously. A sharpened tool might seem trivial, but to the craftsman whose livelihood depended on it, the restoration was essential.

Significance, Sheldon was learning, was not about scale but about impact. A small contribution that mattered deeply to someone was more valuable than a large contribution that mattered to no one. The repaired toy that let a child play again. The restored clock that kept a family on schedule. The fixed lamp that allowed an elderly person to read at night.

These things mattered. They mattered because people mattered, and people needed their things to work.

The warmth in his chest hummed its agreement.

Nineteen days. Nearly three weeks since his arrival. The foundation was solid, the building was rising, the life was taking shape.

He thought about what lay ahead. More tool restoration with Tanaka. The tatami work beginning next week with Hashimoto. Eventually, the electrical and plumbing work that would make the house fully functional. Then the repair shop opening, customers arriving, a role being filled that the village needed.

Each step led to the next, each accomplishment enabling new possibilities. The pattern was clear, the trajectory established. He was building something real, something lasting, something that would continue to matter long after any individual repair was forgotten.

Tomorrow would bring more of the same—shrine work, kitten care, the ordinary tasks that constituted a meaningful life. No drama, no crisis, no extraordinary events. Just the steady accumulation of days, each one adding another layer to the emerging whole.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

The tools rested in their bundle, restored and ready.

The kitten slept in his bed, named and loved.

The village was quiet, accepting and accepted.

Nineteen days down.

The building continued.

⁂

## Day 20

---

## Saturday, April 22, 1989

---

Saturday arrived with the particular stillness that marked weekends at the shrine.

No school bus to catch, no lessons to attend, no schedule imposed from outside. The day belonged to the household, to be shaped according to their own rhythms. Sheldon woke to find the shrine already stirring—Katsuhito's footsteps on the engawa, the distant sound of water being drawn, the small noises of a home coming alive.

Tenchi was, predictably, already with Hikaru.

The mudroom had become the boy's first destination each morning, the kitten his first greeting. The pattern had solidified in less than a week—wake, visit Hikaru, then proceed with whatever the day required. On school days, this meant a brief visit before breakfast. On weekends, it meant extended time, uninterrupted by external obligations.

"He's getting bigger," Tenchi announced, when Sheldon appeared at the mudroom door. "Look—his paws are bigger than they were."

The observation was accurate, if subtle. Kittens changed rapidly at this age, each day bringing incremental growth that accumulated into visible transformation. Hikaru's paws did seem slightly larger, his body slightly longer, his face slightly less kitten-round.

"He is growing well. You are feeding him properly."

"I measure the food exactly like the bag says. And I change his water twice a day, even though the book says once is enough." Tenchi stroked the orange fur with careful attention. "I want him to be healthy."

"He appears very healthy. Alert, active, good appetite. All signs of a thriving kitten."

"Thriving," Tenchi repeated, as though testing the word. "I like that. Thriving means doing really well, right? Better than just okay?"

"Yes. It means flourishing. Growing not just in size but in wellbeing."

"Then I want him to thrive forever."

"Forever is a long time. But you can certainly work toward that goal."

Hikaru, apparently indifferent to discussions of his thriving, pounced on the mouse toy with the enthusiasm that marked most of his waking hours. The hunting instincts were developing nicely, his movements becoming more coordinated each day.

---

Breakfast was leisurely, the weekend pace allowing for conversation.

"I have been thinking about the house," Katsuhito said, addressing Sheldon. "The restoration timeline."

"Hashimoto begins the tatami work next week. That is the next major phase."

"Yes. And after that?"

"Electrical assessment, then plumbing. Both will require specialists—I can learn the basics, but the initial evaluation should be done by someone with proper training."

"I know an electrician. Watanabe, in the next village. He is retired now but still takes occasional work. He would be appropriate for an assessment."

"Can you introduce us?"

"I will write a letter of introduction. You can deliver it when you are ready for that phase." Katsuhito sipped his tea, considering. "The plumbing is more complex. The village has no dedicated plumber—most repairs are done by whoever is available, with varying results."

"I have been reading about plumbing principles. The theory is not overly complicated, though the practice requires experience."

"You could learn from books and trial. Start with simple repairs, build toward more complex work." The old man's expression carried something like amusement. "You are accumulating quite a collection of skills."

"Each one seems necessary. The repair shop will require diverse capabilities."

"It will. And you are building them systematically, which is the correct approach." Katsuhito set down his cup. "Today I had planned to visit the forest shrine. The small one, higher on the mountain. It requires periodic maintenance that I have been neglecting."

"I was not aware there was a second shrine."

"It is very small—more of a waystation than a full shrine. Hikers and pilgrims stop there to rest and pray before continuing to the summit. I should check on it, clear any debris, ensure the structure is sound."

"May I accompany you?"

"I had hoped you would offer. The walk is long, and the work is easier with two sets of hands."

"Tenchi as well?"

"If he wishes. The path is not difficult, merely time-consuming. He has made the journey before."

Tenchi, who had been following the conversation with growing interest, immediately volunteered. "I want to come! Can Hikaru come too?"

"The kitten is too young for such a journey. He would become exhausted, and carrying him would be impractical."

"But he'll be lonely here by himself."

"He will sleep, as kittens do. We will return before evening, and he will barely notice our absence."

Tenchi's expression suggested doubt about this claim, but he did not argue. The opportunity to explore the mountain outweighed his concern for the kitten's temporary solitude.

"Okay. But I want to check on him one more time before we leave."

"That is acceptable. We depart in one hour."

---

The preparation for the journey was methodical.

Katsuhito gathered tools for the maintenance work—a small saw, binding wire, cloth for cleaning. Sheldon prepared a simple lunch that could be eaten on the trail—rice balls, pickled vegetables, dried fish. Tenchi oscillated between helping with preparations and visiting Hikaru, his attention divided between the adventure ahead and the companion he was leaving behind.

"He's sleeping now," Tenchi reported, after his final mudroom visit. "I told him we'd be back before dinner."

"Did he seem to understand?"

"Probably not. But I wanted to say it anyway. Just in case."

The impulse was touching—the desire to communicate even when communication was uncertain. Sheldon remembered doing similar things with his grandmother's house plants, explaining his absences as though the ferns and philodendrons might be keeping track.

"Ready?" Katsuhito asked, emerging from the house with a small pack.

"Ready," Tenchi confirmed, his earlier hesitation replaced by excitement.

They set off along the path that led deeper into the mountain, past the boundaries of the familiar shrine grounds, into territory Sheldon had not yet explored.

---

The forest changed as they climbed.

Near the shrine, the trees were familiar—cedars and maples, their presence maintained and managed by generations of caretakers. The underbrush was cleared regularly, the paths kept open, the careful balance between nature and cultivation that characterized Japanese gardens extended into the surrounding woodland.

But as the path rose, the forest became wilder. The undergrowth thickened, ferns and brambles encroaching on the trail. The trees grew closer together, their canopy blocking more of the sky. The sense of human influence faded, replaced by something older and less managed.

"This was all shrine land, once," Katsuhito explained, noting Sheldon's attention to the surroundings. "Before the reforms, before the changes that reduced the shrine's holdings. My grandfather remembered when the mountain was ours to the summit."

"What happened?"

"History. Governments changed, policies shifted, land was redistributed. The Meiji Restoration, then later reforms, each taking a portion of what the shrine had held for centuries." He did not seem troubled by this history, merely noting it as fact. "The shrine retained what it needed for immediate function, but the higher reaches passed into other hands. Government land, national forest, designations that meant little in practical terms but everything in legal ones."

"And yet you continue to maintain the upper shrine."

"The forest shrine remains ours by tradition if not by law. No one has claimed it, and we continue to maintain it. Perhaps because the effort required discourages casual acquisition. Perhaps because there is still some respect for what the land represents." Katsuhito stepped over a fallen branch. "Or perhaps simply because no one has bothered to assert a competing claim."

The path wound upward through switchbacks, the grade steady but not steep. The earth beneath their feet was soft with accumulated leaf litter, the footing requiring attention but not difficulty. Tenchi moved with the energy of youth, sometimes running ahead to the next bend, sometimes falling back to examine something interesting—a peculiar rock formation that might have been natural or might have been human-made, an unusual flower growing in a patch of sunlight, a beetle crossing the path with single-minded determination.

"What's that?" he asked, pointing to a moss-covered stone structure half-hidden in the undergrowth. The stone was rectangular, clearly shaped by human hands, but time had softened its edges and covered its surface with green growth.

"An old marker. Pilgrims placed them centuries ago, to indicate the correct path." Katsuhito paused to examine it, brushing away accumulated debris with careful hands. Beneath the moss, faint characters were visible—worn almost to nothing but still present. "This one is quite worn. The original inscription is barely visible."

"What did it say?"

"Probably a prayer, or an indication of distance to the summit. These markers were practical as well as spiritual—they helped travelers know they were on the right path, offered encouragement when the journey grew difficult."

"Like trail markers in hiking books?"

"Similar, yes. The technology changes, but the need remains the same—humans require guidance through unfamiliar territory. Whether that guidance comes from carved stones or painted signs or electronic devices, the fundamental purpose is identical."

They continued upward, the markers appearing at irregular intervals. Some were well-maintained, their inscriptions clear, evidence of ongoing attention from unknown caretakers. Others had succumbed to time and weather, becoming indistinguishable from ordinary stones to any but the most careful observer. The forest preserved them equally, moss and lichen making no distinction between sacred and mundane.

"How many people still make this pilgrimage?" Sheldon asked.

"Fewer each year. The old traditions are fading, replaced by different forms of seeking. But some still come—a handful each season, usually older people who remember when such journeys were common." Katsuhito's pace was steady, neither hurried nor labored. "I hope that Tenchi's generation will rediscover the value of such practices, but I do not expect it."

"You seem at peace with that possibility."

"What choice is there? Traditions persist when they meet genuine needs. When those needs change, the traditions must adapt or fade. Clinging to forms that no longer serve only prolongs the death, does not prevent it."

"A pragmatic view of heritage."

"A realistic view. I love these practices, I maintain them with sincere devotion, but I do not pretend they are immune to the forces that shape all human endeavors." He gestured at the forest around them. "This mountain will outlast our shrines, our markers, our ceremonies. It existed before humans walked these slopes and will exist after we are gone. The best we can do is tend what we can tend, for as long as we can tend it."

Tenchi had run ahead again, his small form visible at the next switchback. "Grandpa! There's a stream here! Can I look at it?"

"Carefully. Do not fall in."

The boy was already crouched at the water's edge when they caught up, examining the clear flow with intense concentration. The stream was small—barely a meter wide—but its water was pure and cold, carrying the runoff from higher elevations.

"There are tiny fish! Really tiny! Like the size of my pinky!"

"Char. They live in mountain streams where the water is cold and clean." Katsuhito knelt beside his grandson. "My grandfather used to catch them with his hands. It requires great patience and quick reflexes."

"Can you teach me?"

"Perhaps someday. It is a skill that takes years to develop." The old man's expression carried something between amusement and nostalgia. "My own success rate was never impressive. Your great-great-grandfather would have been disappointed."

Tenchi watched the tiny fish dart through the current, their movements too quick to follow individually but creating a collective pattern like scattered light. "They're so fast."

"They must be. The stream is dangerous—predators above and below, currents that could sweep them away. Speed is survival."

"That's kind of sad. Always having to be afraid."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps it is simply the nature of their existence. They do not know another way of being. The fear that seems sad to us may be, to them, simply the alertness that keeps them alive."

The philosophical tangent seemed to satisfy Tenchi, who watched the fish for another moment before rising. "Okay. I'm ready to keep going."

They continued the climb, the stream's sound fading behind them as the path wound upward.

---

The forest shrine appeared after two hours of walking.

It was small, as Katsuhito had described—a single structure no larger than a modest room, with a torii gate that had seen better days. The roof was intact but weathered, the supporting posts showing signs of age. A small clearing surrounded the structure, kept open by the occasional attention it received.

"When was it built?" Sheldon asked, examining the craftsmanship.

"No one knows precisely. My grandfather believed it dated to the medieval period, but there are no records." Katsuhito set down his pack and began assessing the structure. "The design is simple, which suggests either great age or modest resources. Perhaps both."

Tenchi was already exploring, circling the structure with curious attention. "There's a face carved here! In the wood!"

"A protective deity. They are common on mountain shrines—meant to ward off evil spirits and protect travelers."

"He looks grumpy."

"Protective deities often do. Their role is to intimidate, not to welcome. The welcoming comes from within the shrine itself."

The morning's work began with clearing debris—fallen branches, accumulated leaves, the general disorder that nature imposed on human structures. Katsuhito directed the effort, assigning tasks according to capability. Sheldon handled the heavier work, moving larger branches and checking the structural integrity of the posts. Tenchi gathered smaller debris into piles for later disposal.

The work was meditative in its simplicity. Sheldon found himself falling into a rhythm—lift, carry, place, return. The physical effort was satisfying, the kind of honest labor that left the body tired but the mind clear. The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, the subtle enhancement making the work feel natural, the movements efficient.

"The posts on this side are sound," he reported, after completing a thorough examination. "No significant rot, no structural weakness. The wood has weathered but remains strong."

"That is the benefit of proper construction. My ancestors chose their materials carefully." Katsuhito was examining the opposite side. "Here as well. The foundation will outlast us all."

Tenchi had finished gathering leaves and was now investigating the small altar inside the shrine. "What's this for?" he asked, pointing to a stone vessel set before the simple wooden structure within.

"Offerings. Water, rice, sake—depending on the occasion and the resources of the visitor." Katsuhito joined him inside the small space. "The altar itself is quite old. The wood has been replaced many times, but the stone beneath has remained since the shrine's founding."

"How old is the stone?"

"No one knows. Centuries at minimum. Perhaps a millennium." The old man ran his hand across the worn surface. "It has received countless offerings, absorbed countless prayers. Whatever power resides in sacred objects, this stone has accumulated much."

"Can I touch it?"

"With respect. Approach it as you would a person deserving of honor."

Tenchi extended his hand slowly, his small palm coming to rest on the stone with visible care. His expression shifted—something like surprise, or perhaps recognition.

"It's warm," he said. "Warmer than it should be."

"The stone retains heat differently than the air. It has been absorbing sunlight that reached it through the opening."

"No, it's... it's different warm." Tenchi struggled to articulate what he was feeling. "Like it knows I'm touching it."

Katsuhito's expression was unreadable. "Sacred objects sometimes feel that way. Whether it is the stone or the observer who creates the feeling is a question without a clear answer."

Tenchi withdrew his hand, looking at it as though expecting to see something different. "That was weird. Good weird, but weird."

"Remember the feeling. It may be important someday."

"The roof needs attention," Katsuhito observed, after completing a circuit of inspection outside. "Several shingles are loose. They should be secured before the summer rains."

"Can we fix them today?"

"We can attempt it. The materials are limited, but basic repairs are possible."

Sheldon climbed onto the roof with careful movements, testing each section before committing his weight. The structure was more solid than it appeared—the core timbers remained sound, only the surface elements showing significant wear. Centuries of weather had worn the wood smooth, had bleached it to a silver-grey that seemed almost to glow in the filtered forest light.

"The underlying framework is good," he reported. "The problem is primarily the shingles. Some have shifted, others have cracked."

"Can you reset the shifted ones?"

"I believe so. The cracked ones will need replacement eventually, but they can be stabilized for now."

The work proceeded methodically. Sheldon repositioned loose shingles, securing them with the binding wire Katsuhito had brought. The technique was similar to what Tanaka had demonstrated for other repairs—not forcing materials into place, but finding the position they naturally wanted to occupy and securing them there.

Tenchi served as assistant, passing up materials and maintaining a running commentary on the proceedings.

"This is like building the fort, kind of. Except the fort was new and this is old."

"Restoration and construction share many principles. Both require attention to structure, to materials, to the way things fit together."

"But restoration is about making old things work again. Construction is about making new things that work for the first time."

"Yes. Both are valuable. Some people prefer one over the other, but the skills overlap significantly."

"Which do you prefer?"

Sheldon considered the question while adjusting a stubborn shingle. The wood had warped slightly over time, and it resisted returning to its original position. He applied gentle, consistent pressure, waiting for the material to yield rather than forcing it.

"I am not certain yet. I have more experience with restoration—the house, the tools. But I enjoyed building the fort with you. Perhaps I prefer whichever is needed at the moment."

"That's a good answer. Flexible."

"Flexibility is valuable. Rigidity limits what you can accomplish."

The shingle finally settled into place, and Sheldon secured it with careful wraps of wire. The repair was not elegant, but it was sound. It would hold through the rains, would protect the interior until more permanent repairs could be made.

"You have a gentle touch," Katsuhito observed from below. "You work with the materials rather than against them."

"Tanaka taught me that. Force is the enemy of good work."

"He would say that. It is true in most endeavors—carpentry, calligraphy, relationships. The best results come from understanding what something wants to become, then helping it get there."

---

They broke for lunch in the small clearing before the shrine.

The view from this elevation was impressive—the valley spread below, the village visible as a cluster of roofs, the shrine's distinctive architecture marking its location on the mountainside. The air was cooler here, the breeze carrying the scent of high forest.

"I can see our house," Tenchi said, pointing. "Or at least where it should be. It's too small to actually see."

"The shrine is visible. You can orient from there."

"And Hikaru is in the mudroom. Probably sleeping. He sleeps a lot during the day."

"Kittens need significant rest for growth. It is normal and healthy."

"I know. But I still think about him." Tenchi bit into a rice ball, chewing thoughtfully. "Is it weird that I think about him all the time?"

"Not weird. Natural. He is new and important to you. Your mind is still adjusting to his presence."

"Will I always think about him this much?"

"The intensity will probably decrease as his presence becomes normal. But you will always be aware of him, always consider his needs. That is what caring for someone means."

"That sounds okay. As long as I don't forget about him."

"You will not forget. He is part of your life now. Part of your daily patterns, your routines, your concerns. Forgetting would require actively suppressing his existence, which you have no reason to do."

Tenchi seemed satisfied by this assurance. He returned to his rice ball, his attention shifting to the view.

Katsuhito ate in silence, his eyes on the horizon. There was something meditative in his stillness, a quality of presence that suggested deep familiarity with this place.

"You have made this journey many times," Sheldon observed.

"Hundreds of times. Since I was younger than Tenchi. My grandfather brought me, as his grandfather brought him." The old man's voice carried layers of memory. "This shrine has been in my family's care for generations beyond counting. Whatever legal ownership might say, it belongs to us spiritually."

"And now you bring Tenchi."

"And now I bring Tenchi. And I bring you." He turned to look at Sheldon directly. "The tradition continues, adapted to new circumstances. New family members, new caretakers, new links in the chain."

"I am honored to be included."

"You have earned inclusion. Through work, through attention, through the care you show." Katsuhito returned his gaze to the valley. "This is what family means, in the end. Not blood, but shared responsibility. Not inheritance, but chosen commitment."

The words settled in the mountain air, finding their place among the ancient trees and weathered stones.

---

The afternoon's work completed the restoration.

The roof was secured, the clearing fully cleared, the small altar within the shrine cleaned and renewed. Katsuhito performed a brief ceremony—prayers spoken in archaic Japanese, offerings of rice and sake placed with formal precision.

Tenchi watched with unusual solemnity, apparently understanding that something significant was occurring even if the details escaped him.

"What did you say?" he asked afterward.

"Thanks and requests. Thanks for the shrine's continued existence, requests for its continued protection." Katsuhito carefully stored the ceremonial implements. "The words matter less than the intention behind them."

"But the words are really old, right? From long ago?"

"Very old. Passed down through many generations, preserved even as their original meaning has become obscure."

"Why keep using them if we don't fully understand them?"

"Because they connect us to those who came before. Because the act of preservation is itself meaningful. Because some things gain power from continuity rather than comprehension."

Tenchi processed this, his young face thoughtful. "Like traditions. We do them because our parents did them, and their parents did them."

"Yes. Traditions are containers for meaning that transcends any individual life. We participate in something larger than ourselves when we maintain them."

"So when I take care of Hikaru, I'm part of a tradition? The tradition of people taking care of cats?"

"In a sense, yes. Humans have cared for cats for thousands of years. Each person who does so participates in that long relationship, adds their own chapter to the ongoing story."

"That's cool." Tenchi smiled. "I'm part of something really old and really big, just by feeding my kitten."

"You are. The small acts connect to large patterns. Nothing exists in isolation."

---

The descent was quicker than the climb.

Gravity assisted their progress, and familiarity with the path allowed for greater speed. They moved in comfortable silence for long stretches, the afternoon light shifting through the canopy, the sounds of the forest providing gentle accompaniment.

"Thank you for bringing me," Tenchi said, as the shrine grounds came into view. "That was really fun."

"Thank you for coming. Your help was valuable."

"I didn't do that much. Just cleared leaves and passed up materials."

"Every contribution matters. The work would have taken longer without your assistance."

"Really?"

"Really. Never underestimate the value of willing hands and good attitude. Technical skill can be learned. Willingness must be chosen."

Tenchi accepted this with visible pleasure, his steps quickening as they approached home. The pull of the kitten was reasserting itself, the adventure's satisfaction giving way to the desire for reunion.

"Can I run ahead?"

"If you wish. We will follow at our own pace."

He was gone before the permission was fully granted, small legs carrying him toward the mudroom with impressive speed.

Katsuhito watched him go with something like affection. "He has energy to spare."

"The young usually do. It is one of their advantages."

"And one of their challenges. Learning to direct that energy productively is a lifetime's work." The old man walked steadily, his pace unhurried. "You are good for him."

"I try to be."

"You succeed. Not perfectly—no one succeeds perfectly—but consistently. That is what matters."

They reached the shrine grounds as the sun began its descent toward the western hills. Tenchi was already in the mudroom, his voice audible through the thin walls—an extended monologue about mountains and shrines and protective deities, delivered to an audience of one small orange cat.

"He will be talking for some time," Katsuhito observed. "I suggest we prepare dinner without him."

"A reasonable approach."

They moved toward the kitchen together, the day's work complete, the evening's routines beginning.

---

Dinner was simple but satisfying.

The day's exertions had built appetites, and the food disappeared quickly. Rice, miso soup, grilled fish, pickled vegetables—the reliable components of household meals, prepared with care and consumed with gratitude.

Tenchi recounted the adventure to Hikaru through the mudroom door, maintaining a connection even while eating. His voice carried through the thin walls, a continuous stream of observation and interpretation.

"The shrine was really old. Like, really really old. Older than Grandpa, even older than his grandfather. And there was this stone inside that felt warm when I touched it—not just regular warm, but special warm. And Grandpa did a ceremony with old words that nobody fully understands anymore, but we keep saying them anyway because traditions are important..."

"He is integrating the day's lessons," Katsuhito observed quietly.

"Translating them into his own understanding. That is how learning solidifies." Sheldon set down his chopsticks. "The best education is not passive reception but active interpretation."

"Yes. The best teaching is not memorization but transformation. Taking what is given and making it one's own." Katsuhito refilled his tea cup. "That is why I do not simply tell him facts. I show him experiences, and let him derive his own conclusions."

"He mentioned the connection between caring for Hikaru and the long tradition of humans caring for cats. I had not anticipated that particular insight."

"Children often find connections adults overlook. Their minds are less constrained by expectations of what should relate to what. An adult might never think to connect a kitten in a mudroom to ancient sacred traditions, but to Tenchi, both involve care, responsibility, continuity. The connection is obvious once he sees it."

The observation was accurate. Tenchi's willingness to see patterns across domains—tool restoration and cooking, kitten care and ancient traditions—reflected a flexibility that more structured thinking might miss. His mind had not yet learned which connections were supposed to matter and which were supposed to be irrelevant.

"I hope he retains that quality."

"Some do, some do not. Education often narrows rather than expands. The very process of becoming expert in something requires focusing attention, which means neglecting other things. By the time someone is truly knowledgeable in one area, they have often lost the ability to see connections to other areas." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "But with proper guidance, the flexibility can survive. It can be maintained alongside increasing depth."

"Is that our role? Providing proper guidance?"

"Part of it. Also modeling—showing him how flexible thinking works in practice. When you connect tool restoration to relationship maintenance, when you find principles in carpentry that apply to calligraphy, you are demonstrating the kind of thinking we want him to develop." He paused. "Also protection—ensuring that rigid structures do not crush his natural curiosity. Schools can be harsh on children who think differently."

"Has he experienced that?"

"Not significantly, not yet. His school is small and his teacher is kind. But as he grows, as he encounters larger institutions with more rigid expectations, the pressure will increase. Our role is to provide a counterbalance—a place where his unusual connections are valued rather than corrected."

"A significant responsibility."

"All responsibility for children is significant. They are the most important work most humans ever undertake." Katsuhito's expression carried something between burden and privilege. "I did not choose this responsibility. It was thrust upon me by circumstance. But I accept it, and I try to fulfill it with the attention it deserves."

"You speak of Kiyone's death."

"Yes. And of choices made before that—my own decisions that led to this moment." The old man's voice carried layers of history that Sheldon could not fully read. "Every parent, every guardian, arrives at the role through a unique path. Some planned for it carefully. Others stumbled into it. What matters is not the arrival but the commitment afterward."

Sheldon thought of his own grandmother—how she had stepped in when his parents failed, how she had provided the stability that allowed him to survive his childhood. She had not chosen to raise a grandchild. The circumstances had required it. But she had committed fully, had given him everything she could, had made the choice to love him despite the difficulties.

"My grandmother was like that. She did not expect to raise me. But when she had to, she did it with complete devotion."

"You have spoken of her before. She sounds like a remarkable woman."

"She was. She was the only person who truly saw me, who valued me for who I was rather than who I might become." The memory was bittersweet—gratitude for what she had given, grief for her absence. "When she died, I lost my only anchor. I drifted for many years afterward."

"And now you are anchored again."

"I am learning to be. Tenchi anchors me. You anchor me. The work anchors me. Each connection adds to the stability."

"Good. Anchors are not found; they are built. You are building yours well."

---

The evening settled into familiar patterns.

Tenchi played with Hikaru until bath time, recounting the day's adventure in various forms—sometimes narrative, sometimes dialogue with the kitten, sometimes simple exclamations of remembered delight.

"The view was so big! You could see forever! Or at least really far! And the shrine was tiny but really important! And there was a grumpy face carved in the wood that protects travelers from evil spirits! And the stone inside was warm like it knew I was touching it!"

Hikaru responded to the energy if not the content, playing with increased enthusiasm when Tenchi's voice rose, settling when it calmed. The kitten was learning to read his person's moods, to match the emotional frequency of the small human who cared for him.

"He's a good listener," Tenchi said, when Sheldon came to announce bath time. "He doesn't understand the words, but he pays attention anyway."

"Attention is the first form of love. He offers it freely."

"And I offer it back. That's why we're friends."

"That is exactly why."

Bath time and bedtime proceeded without incident. Tenchi was tired from the day's exertions, his energy finally depleting after hours of climbing and working and talking. Sleep claimed him quickly, Usagi-chan tucked under one arm, the soft sounds of kitten movements audible from the mudroom.

"Goodnight, Tenchi. Dream of mountain shrines and ancient stones."

"Goodnight, Tsukino-san. Thank you for helping fix the roof."

"You are welcome. Thank you for helping clear the leaves."

"Every contribution matters. You taught me that."

"I am glad you remembered."

The boy's eyes closed, his breathing evening out within moments. The day had been full, and his body demanded rest.

---

On the engawa, the stars emerged one by one.

Sheldon sat alone, Katsuhito having retired early after the day's journey. The mountain was quiet, the forest sounds gentle, the air carrying the particular freshness of high altitude.

Twenty days. Nearly three weeks since his arrival. The foundation was built, the relationships established, the routines solidified. What had begun as chaos—waking in a field, possessing nothing—had become order, belonging, purpose.

The forest shrine lingered in his thoughts. That small structure, tended by generations, maintained through centuries of change. Governments had risen and fallen, wars had been fought, technologies had transformed the world—and still the shrine persisted, still someone climbed the mountain to clear debris and offer prayers.

There was something comforting in that continuity. The knowledge that some things endured, that care could span generations, that small acts of maintenance accumulated into lasting preservation. The shingles he had secured today might hold for years, might protect the interior through dozens of rainy seasons. A small contribution, but real.

He was part of that now. Not through blood or birth, but through choice and action. He had climbed the mountain, helped repair the roof, witnessed the ceremony. Another link in the chain, another chapter in the ongoing story.

And Tenchi was learning to be part of it too. The boy's experience with the warm stone, whatever it meant, had been real to him. His observations about traditions and kitten care showed a mind beginning to grasp continuity, connection, the way individual acts fit into larger patterns.

Perhaps that was the best gift one generation could give the next—not specific knowledge or particular skills, but the understanding that things mattered, that actions had consequences beyond their immediate effects, that each person inherited a world and would pass it on, changed by their presence.

Sheldon thought about his own inheritance. The grandmother who had raised him. The scientific training he had received. The life experiences that had shaped his understanding. All of it had been given to him by others, had prepared him for a moment he could never have anticipated.

And now he was passing things on. Teaching Tenchi about patience and care. Learning skills from Tanaka that he would someday use to help others. Contributing to a community that would outlast any individual member. The chain continued, link by link, each person adding their portion before passing the burden to the next.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, acknowledging the significance. Whatever power it represented—the Jumpchain, the Benefactor, whatever mysterious force had brought him here—it seemed to approve of this orientation. Building rather than conquering. Contributing rather than extracting. Fitting into existing structures rather than imposing new ones.

Perhaps that was the lesson he was meant to learn. That the grandest accomplishments came not from dramatic interventions but from patient accumulation. That significance was measured not in monuments but in the continued wellbeing of those touched by your presence.

Tomorrow would bring Sunday—the end of week three. Hashimoto would begin tatami work on Monday or Tuesday, the next phase of house restoration. More tool restoration with Tanaka next Friday. The patterns were established, the progress continuing, the life taking shape.

He thought about what lay ahead. Weeks of gradual improvement, months of slow integration, years of steady building. A lifetime of small contributions, each one adding to the whole. It was not the life his previous self would have chosen—that Sheldon had wanted recognition, acclaim, the kind of significance that could be measured and displayed.

But that Sheldon had died alone in an empty office, his contributions already fading into the background of the field he had served. His papers were citations in other papers, his theories stepping stones to other theories. The individual had dissolved into the collective, the personal achievements absorbed into the impersonal progress of knowledge.

This path offered something different. Not fame, not recognition, but connection. Not achievements, but relationships. Not the kind of significance that could be measured, but the kind that was felt by those who experienced it.

The repaired roof would protect the shrine. The sharpened tools would enable good work. The raised boy would become a good man. These things could not be listed on a resume or mentioned in an obituary, but they mattered. They mattered because they affected real people in tangible ways.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep. The day's exertions had tired his body pleasantly, the kind of fatigue that promised deep rest.

Twenty days down.

The building continued.

⁂

## Day 21

---

## Sunday, April 23, 1989

---

Three weeks.

Sheldon woke with the awareness settling over him like morning light—twenty-one days since he had opened his eyes in an unfamiliar field, possessing nothing but confusion and a strange warmth in his chest. Three weeks since his previous life had ended and this one had begun.

The shrine was quiet in the early hours, the household still asleep. He rose and dressed in the darkness, moving with the automatic ease that came from repetition. His body knew this room now, knew where the floor creaked and where the door stuck, knew the path to the washroom and the sound of water in the pipes.

Three weeks of learning. Three weeks of building. Three weeks of becoming someone new while remaining, somehow, himself.

He stepped onto the engawa, letting the cool morning air fill his lungs. The sky was lightening in the east, the stars fading one by one as dawn approached. The mountain was waking around him—bird songs beginning, insects stirring, the forest shaking off the stillness of night.

Twenty-one days ago, he had been a dying physicist in an empty office, his life's work forgotten before he drew his final breath. Now he was... what? A shrine helper? A surrogate father? A student of traditional crafts? All of these, and something more that he could not quite name.

The warmth hummed in his chest, acknowledging the milestone. Whatever power it represented, it seemed pleased with his progress.

---

Tenchi was awake early, as had become his pattern.

The boy appeared at the mudroom door before Sheldon had finished his morning tea, already dressed and eager to begin his daily routine with Hikaru. The kitten's presence had restructured Tenchi's mornings, had given him a reason to rise and a responsibility to fulfill. Where before he might have lingered in bed, now he had somewhere to be, someone who needed him.

"Good morning," Sheldon said, watching from the engawa.

"Good morning! Hikaru was already awake when I got there. He was sitting by the door like he was waiting for me." Tenchi's voice carried the particular excitement of discovery. "He was right at the door, not in his bed or by his food or anywhere else. Just sitting there, looking at the door."

"He is learning your patterns. Cats are excellent observers of routine."

"That's so cool." Tenchi settled onto the engawa beside Sheldon, Hikaru cradled in his arms. The kitten seemed content with this transportation, purring steadily, his small body vibrating with the sound. "He knows when I'm coming."

"He knows when you usually come. Whether he understands the concept of 'waiting' is less certain. But he has learned that your arrival follows certain signs—sounds in the house, light through the window, changes in the air. He has associated those signs with your presence, and so he positions himself accordingly."

"So he's smart about noticing things, even if he doesn't think about them the way I do."

"Precisely. Different kinds of intelligence serve different kinds of creatures. Cats do not need to think in words or concepts the way humans do. They need to notice patterns, anticipate events, react quickly to changes. Their intelligence is shaped by their needs."

Tenchi stroked Hikaru's fur, his expression thoughtful. The kitten's eyes were half-closed in contentment, his paws tucked beneath him, his tail wrapped around Tenchi's arm. The bond between them was visible, tangible, growing stronger each day.

"Do you think he loves me? Really loves me, not just likes me because I feed him?"

The question was earnest, the kind children asked when they were trying to understand something that mattered deeply to them. Sheldon recognized the vulnerability in it—the desire for reassurance, the fear of discovering that the connection he felt so strongly might be one-sided.

"I think love takes many forms," Sheldon said carefully. "Human love involves language and memory and complex emotion. We can articulate our feelings, remember past experiences, imagine future possibilities. Our love is shaped by these capacities—it is layered, nuanced, capable of great depth and also great confusion."

"Like how sometimes you love someone but you're also mad at them?"

"Exactly. Human love can hold contradictions. But cat love is simpler—attachment, comfort, the desire to be near. It is not less real for being simpler. It is just different." He paused, choosing his words. "Whether these are the same thing or different things with the same name is a question philosophers have debated for centuries. But the practical answer, I think, is that it does not matter."

"It doesn't matter?"

"What matters is how it feels. How it functions. Whether it brings comfort and connection." Sheldon gestured to Hikaru, still purring in Tenchi's arms. "He seeks you out. He prefers your presence. He feels safer when you are near. He sleeps more deeply when he knows you are close by, plays more freely when you are watching, eats more calmly when you have filled his dish. If that is not love, it is something very close to it."

Tenchi nodded slowly, apparently satisfied by this analysis. He looked down at the kitten, who looked back up at him with the steady gaze of complete trust.

"I love him. And I think he loves me back. Even if it's different, it's still real."

"That is a wise conclusion."

"Mom said something like that once. About how different people love in different ways, but it's all still love." His voice softened at the mention of his mother. "She said some people show love by talking about their feelings, and some people show it by doing things for you, and some people show it by just being there. They're all real."

"Your mother was a wise woman."

"Yeah. She was." Tenchi held Hikaru a little closer. "I think she would be happy that I have Hikaru. That I have someone to love and take care of."

"I am certain she would be."

---

Breakfast was leisurely, the Sunday pace allowing for extended conversation.

Katsuhito joined them after his morning prayers, his expression carrying the particular calm that followed spiritual practice. He accepted tea from Sheldon with a nod of thanks and settled at the table with the unhurried movements of someone who had nowhere pressing to be.

"Three weeks," he observed, addressing Sheldon. "You have been counting."

"It helps me track progress. To see where I was and where I am."

"And where are you?"

The question invited reflection. Sheldon considered his answer carefully.

"More settled than I expected to be. More connected. When I arrived, I had nothing—no possessions, no relationships, no purpose. Now I have all three." He paused. "The speed of it surprises me. I did not expect to feel at home so quickly."

"You worked at it. Belonging does not happen by accident—it requires effort, attention, the willingness to invest in relationships and responsibilities." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "Many people pass through communities without ever truly arriving. They remain observers, visitors, people who are present but not connected. You chose differently."

"I had good guides. You welcomed me when you had no reason to. The village accepted me despite my strangeness. Tanaka offered teaching. Hashimoto shared knowledge. None of this was inevitable."

"No. But none of it was unearned, either. You created the conditions for acceptance through your behavior. The welcome we offered was a response to who you showed yourself to be."

Tenchi had been following this conversation with the partial attention of a child more interested in his kitten than in adult discussion. But something seemed to catch his interest.

"Three weeks is how long it's been since Tsukino-san came?"

"Yes. Twenty-one days."

"That's... that's not very long." Tenchi's brow furrowed. "It feels like he's always been here."

"Time moves strangely when measured by experience rather than calendar. A day full of events feels longer than an empty one. Three weeks of intensive living can contain more than three months of routine."

"So it feels like longer because so much happened?"

"Partly. And partly because Tsukino-san has become woven into our lives so thoroughly that imagining his absence has become difficult."

Tenchi considered this, then nodded with apparent satisfaction. "Good. I don't want to imagine him not being here. That would be sad."

"It would be," Katsuhito agreed. "So let us not imagine it."

---

The morning passed in comfortable domesticity.

Sheldon helped with household chores—cleaning, organizing, the small maintenance tasks that accumulated over time. He swept the engawa, wiped down surfaces in the kitchen, sorted items that had accumulated in corners without purpose. The work was meditative, requiring just enough attention to occupy the hands while leaving the mind free to wander.

Tenchi played with Hikaru in the mudroom, their interactions visible through the open door. The boy had invented a new game—dragging a piece of string across the floor and letting the kitten chase it. Hikaru's hunting instincts engaged fully, his small body crouching, his hindquarters wiggling in preparation for each pounce.

"Got you!" Tenchi exclaimed, as the kitten successfully captured the string. "Good job, Hikaru! You're getting really fast!"

The kitten seemed to understand that praise was being offered, looking up at Tenchi with what appeared to be satisfaction before releasing the string for another round.

Katsuhito attended to shrine business—reviewing records, preparing for the week ahead, the administrative work that kept the institution functioning. He sat at a low desk in the corner of the main room, papers spread before him, brush in hand as he made notes in his careful script.

The rhythms were established now, each person knowing their role without needing instruction. Three weeks had been enough time to develop patterns, to learn where help was needed and where it was not, to move through the day without constant coordination.

This was what family felt like, Sheldon realized. Not the dramatic moments—the crises and celebrations that stood out in memory—but the ordinary days, the comfortable routines, the knowledge that others were nearby even when you were not directly interacting with them.

His previous life had lacked this entirely. He had lived alone, worked alone, died alone. The apartment he had inhabited for decades had been a place to sleep and eat, nothing more. No shared meals, no comfortable silences, no sense of inhabiting space with others.

Even his work environment, such as it was, had been solitary. Colleagues passed in hallways, appeared at meetings, sent emails that required responses—but genuine connection had been absent. The concept of sharing daily life with others had been abstract, something observed in others but not experienced himself.

His grandmother's household, loving as it was, had been temporary—a refuge that ended when he left for university at eighteen. He had never replicated that sense of shared existence. The closest he had come was brief periods with romantic partners, relationships that invariably ended because he could not maintain the connection they required.

But here, now, he was experiencing something different. A household that included him not as a guest but as a member. People who expected his presence, who noticed his absence, who built their own patterns around his participation.

Katsuhito looked up from his papers and caught Sheldon's eye. The old man nodded once, acknowledging their shared presence without needing words. Then he returned to his work, and Sheldon returned to his, and the morning continued in its gentle rhythm.

The warmth hummed with what felt like satisfaction.

---

Lunch was simple rice and vegetables, eaten together on the engawa.

The spring day was warm enough for outdoor dining, the sun filtering through the trees to create shifting patterns of light and shadow. The air carried the scent of new growth—grass and leaves and flowers pushing through the warming earth. Somewhere nearby, birds sang territorial claims, their voices bright against the mountain's quiet.

Hikaru had been brought out for the occasion, his territory temporarily expanded to include this new space. Tenchi had asked permission carefully, had explained his reasoning—the kitten was growing more confident, the weather was mild, the expansion would be educational. Katsuhito had agreed, adding the condition that the kitten remain supervised at all times.

The small orange creature explored with cautious enthusiasm, sniffing at plants and investigating corners while never straying far from Tenchi. Each new discovery prompted a pause—ears forward, whiskers twitching, body poised for retreat or further investigation depending on the assessment. The engawa's wooden surface was different from the mudroom's tatami. The scents were different. The sounds were different. Everything required processing.

"He's brave but careful," Tenchi observed, watching Hikaru approach a potted plant with intense concentration. "He wants to explore, but he keeps checking to make sure I'm still here."

"A sensible approach. The world is large and unfamiliar. Maintaining connection to safety while venturing outward is wise."

"Is that what I do? When I try new things?"

Sheldon considered the question. "Often, yes. When you built the fort, you frequently returned to the house for supplies or reassurance. When you began caring for Hikaru, you constantly checked with us about proper techniques. Even your explorations of the forest have boundaries—you venture out, but you return to the paths you know."

"So exploration and security work together. They're not opposites."

"Precisely. Many people make the mistake of thinking courage means abandoning caution entirely. But recklessness is not the same as bravery. True courage involves calculated risk—venturing into uncertainty while maintaining enough connection to safety that retreat remains possible."

Tenchi absorbed this, watching as Hikaru completed his investigation of the plant and moved on to examine a crack between floorboards. "So being brave doesn't mean not being scared. It means being scared but doing things anyway, while also making sure you have backup."

"That is an excellent summary. One of the best I have heard."

Katsuhito had been listening to this exchange with quiet attention. His expression carried something between amusement and approval—the look of someone witnessing education happening naturally, without force or formal structure.

"You have taught him well," he said to Sheldon.

"He has taught himself. I merely provided observations that he integrated into his own understanding."

"That is what good teaching looks like. The best teachers do not impose knowledge—they offer it, and the student chooses what to absorb." The old man set down his rice bowl. "The worst teachers try to force understanding, to control what their students think and believe. This produces compliance but not comprehension."

"Mom used to say something like that," Tenchi said, his voice softening with the mention of his mother. "She said the best learning came from wanting to know, not from being told."

"Your mother was wise. She understood that curiosity was more powerful than instruction." Katsuhito's expression shifted slightly. "She was curious about everything, always asking questions, always wanting to understand how things worked and why they were the way they were."

"Tanaka-san said she was stubborn about her cat. About keeping it even when her dad said no."

"She was stubborn about many things. Stubbornness and curiosity often go together—the desire to know leads to the persistence required to find answers." The old man paused. "She questioned everything, including things I told her. Sometimes this was frustrating. But it was also admirable. She did not simply accept what she was told. She thought for herself."

"I try to think for myself too."

"You do. I see it in how you approach problems, how you consider different possibilities before choosing. This is a valuable quality. Cultivate it."

Tenchi nodded, apparently accepting this as both compliment and instruction. Then his expression shifted, something heavier entering his eyes.

"I miss her." The statement was simple, matter-of-fact, the grief present but no longer overwhelming. "But it doesn't hurt as much as it used to. Is that okay?"

"It is not only okay—it is healthy. Grief is not meant to remain at full intensity forever. It softens, transforms, becomes something you carry rather than something that carries you." Katsuhito's voice was gentle, carrying the weight of his own experience with loss. "Missing her is not the same as being destroyed by her absence. You can hold both—the missing and the living."

Tenchi nodded slowly, processing this. Hikaru had returned to his lap, apparently satisfied with his exploration, and the boy stroked the orange fur absently while he thought.

"I think she would like Hikaru. And Tsukino-san. She would be happy that we're happy."

"I believe she would."

"Then that's what I'll think about. That she's happy for us, wherever she is."

The afternoon brought an unexpected visitor.

Tanaka appeared at the shrine's entrance, his tool bag over one shoulder, his expression carrying something Sheldon could not immediately read. The roofer's visits were typically purposeful, scheduled, connected to specific work. An unannounced Sunday appearance was unusual.

He bowed formally before approaching, the gesture carrying its full weight of respect for the sacred space and its inhabitants.

"I apologize for the unannounced visit. I was nearby and thought I might stop in."

"You are always welcome," Katsuhito said, rising to greet him. "Please, join us for tea."

The roofer accepted the invitation, settling onto the engawa with the careful movements of someone conscious of being a guest in a space that was not his own. His tool bag he set aside, but not so far that it was out of reach—the habit of a craftsman who never fully separated from his implements.

Hikaru, curious about the newcomer, approached to investigate. His small nose twitched as he sampled the scent of wood shavings and metal, of work and effort. Tanaka held still, allowing the examination, then slowly extended a finger for the kitten to sniff.

"A kitten," Tanaka observed, as Hikaru completed his assessment and retreated to Tenchi's lap. "The one from Yamamoto-san?"

"Yes. His name is Hikaru. Tenchi named him."

"A good name. Light." The roofer's expression softened slightly, the severe lines of his face easing. "Kiyone had a cat when she was young. An orange one, as I recall. Mikan, she called it."

Tenchi looked up with sudden interest, the mention of his mother cutting through whatever else he had been thinking about. "Mom had a cat?"

"When she was about your age. It was a stray that appeared at their door one winter—thin and hungry, barely more than a kitten itself. Hideo wanted to send it away. He said they had no room for strays, no food to spare." Tanaka's voice carried the particular quality of memory being retrieved from long storage. "But Kiyone refused. She fed it scraps from her own meals until Hideo relented."

"She gave it her own food?"

"Yes. Even when it meant she was hungry. She said the cat had no one else to care for it, but she had her family." The roofer's expression carried something that might have been admiration. "She was stubborn that way. Once she decided something was worth doing, she did it regardless of the cost to herself."

"I didn't know that." Tenchi's voice was wondering, the quality of discovering something new about someone he had thought he knew completely. "Nobody told me."

"There are many stories that have not yet been told. A lifetime's worth." Katsuhito's voice was gentle. "Your mother lived for more than twenty years before you were born. Each of those years contained experiences, relationships, events that shaped who she became. We will share them as opportunities arise."

"I want to hear all of them."

"And you will. But stories are best shared naturally, when they connect to something happening in the present. Today, your kitten reminded Tanaka of your mother's cat. Tomorrow, something else will remind someone of another story. The past remains present in this way."

Tanaka turned his attention to Sheldon, the personal memories giving way to practical matters. "I came to discuss the tools. The restoration is proceeding well?"

"Very well, thanks to your teaching. I have been practicing the techniques on other implements—kitchen knives, garden tools, anything that has an edge requiring maintenance."

"Good. Consistency is key. The same motions, the same attention, applied across different tools—this is how the skill becomes reliable rather than occasional." The roofer reached into his bag and produced a small bundle wrapped in cloth. "I brought these. They were Hideo's as well—smaller items that I kept when the main collection went to the house. Precision tools, for detailed work. I thought they might be useful to you."

Sheldon accepted the bundle with care, unwrapping it to reveal a set of delicate instruments. Small chisels with blades no wider than a fingernail. Marking tools with precisely ground points. Scrapers of various shapes, each designed for a specific purpose. Specialized items whose functions were not immediately clear but whose craftsmanship was evident.

"These are beautiful."

"They are. Hideo was particular about his precision tools. He spent years acquiring the best, traveling to distant cities to find craftsmen who still made such things by hand. Some of these came from masters who have since died—their methods are lost, their replacements unavailable." Tanaka's voice carried weight. "I want them to be used, not displayed. If they sit in my workshop gathering dust, his care was wasted. His life's work deserves continuation."

"I will use them well. I will maintain them properly."

"I know you will. That is why I am giving them to you." The roofer met Sheldon's eyes directly. "I do not give such things lightly. I have turned away others who asked for Hideo's tools—people who I knew would not treat them with the respect they deserve. You are different. I saw it from our first conversation."

"Thank you. This means a great deal."

"It should. Hideo would have approved of you, I think. He valued competence and dedication above all other qualities. He had little patience for people who were careless or lazy, who did work that was merely adequate when excellence was possible. But he respected effort, rewarded improvement, encouraged those who showed genuine commitment." Tanaka paused. "You have both. The competence is developing. The dedication has been present from the start."

---

Tanaka stayed for an hour, sharing tea and conversation.

The talk ranged across topics—the weather, the village news, the upcoming tatami work at Sheldon's house. But the undercurrent was personal, the gradual deepening of a relationship that had begun with a single question about roofing techniques.

"Hashimoto begins tomorrow?" Tanaka asked.

"Tuesday, most likely. He sent word that his supplies arrived."

"Good. He does excellent work. The main room will be transformed when he finishes." The roofer set down his tea cup. "And after that?"

"Electrical assessment, then plumbing. Katsuhito has offered to introduce me to Watanabe."

"A good choice. Watanabe is thorough—perhaps too thorough, but that is better than the alternative." Tanaka rose, signaling his departure. "The house will take shape. I have seen such restorations before. They require patience, but the results are worth the wait."

"I have learned to be patient."

"I noticed. It is one of your better qualities." The roofer bowed to Katsuhito, then to Sheldon. "Until Friday. We will continue the tool restoration."

"Until Friday."

Tanaka departed, his footsteps fading down the path toward the village. The afternoon seemed quieter in his absence, the shrine returning to its familiar peace.

"He likes you," Katsuhito observed.

"I had hoped so. It is difficult to tell with him."

"His manner is reserved, but his actions speak clearly. He does not visit casually, does not give gifts lightly. His presence here today was significant."

"The tools he brought—they are remarkable. The craftsmanship is extraordinary."

"Hideo collected the best. He spent decades acquiring instruments that met his standards, traveling to distant cities to find specific items. That collection represents a lifetime of careful curation." Katsuhito paused. "That Tanaka is entrusting it to you piece by piece says everything about his assessment of your character."

"I will honor that trust."

"I know you will. That is why he gave it."

---

The evening meal was prepared together.

All three contributed—Katsuhito handling the rice with the practiced movements of someone who had made it thousands of times, Sheldon preparing vegetables with the careful attention of someone still learning the correct techniques, Tenchi helping where he could with tasks appropriate to his age and skill level.

The kitchen was crowded but comfortable, the movements of three people coordinating without collision. Sheldon passed a knife to Katsuhito, who handed back the cutting board, who received vegetables from Tenchi, who waited for instruction about the next task. The choreography had developed without explicit planning, emerging from three weeks of shared meals and shared labor.

This too was family, Sheldon reflected. The shared work of daily life, the practical cooperation that made a household function. Not just the emotional connections, though those mattered, but the physical reality of living together—preparing food, cleaning spaces, maintaining the structures that sheltered them.

His previous life had been remarkably solitary in its practicalities. He had eaten alone, cleaned alone, existed in spaces that bore no mark of shared habitation. Meals had been functional—fuel consumed at irregular intervals, rarely prepared with care, never shared. The concept of cooking with others, of passing ingredients back and forth, of conversation woven through practical tasks—this had been foreign to him.

Now it felt natural. Three weeks had been enough to establish patterns that felt like they had always existed. His hands knew where to find the bowls, which drawer held the chopsticks, how Katsuhito preferred the vegetables cut. The knowledge had accumulated without conscious effort, absorbed through repetition and attention.

"Tenchi, more ginger," Katsuhito said, and the boy moved to comply without question, knowing where the ginger was kept, how much was typically needed, the rhythm of the household's cooking.

"The water is ready," Sheldon reported, and Katsuhito nodded, reaching for the rice without looking up, trusting that the information was accurate.

Trust. That was what three weeks had built. Not just acceptance or affection, but trust—the confidence that others would fulfill their roles, that the household would function because each person contributed reliably. Trust in the small things that made daily life possible.

"Can I taste the soup?" Tenchi asked.

"One small sip. It is still hot."

The boy complied, his face scrunching in concentration as he assessed the flavor. "Needs more salt?"

"Let us see." Katsuhito tasted as well, then nodded. "You are developing a palate. Yes, a small amount more."

Tenchi beamed at the praise, adding the salt with exaggerated care. His contributions to the meal were minor, but they were real—he was learning, participating, being included in the work that sustained the household.

Dinner itself was eaten slowly, the pace of Sunday evening allowing for lingering over food and conversation. Hikaru slept in the mudroom, exhausted by his afternoon of expanded exploration, his small body curled into a tight orange ball. The household was complete, each member accounted for, each role filled.

"Tomorrow begins a new week," Katsuhito observed. "Hashimoto will begin the tatami work. The house restoration continues."

"And school," Tenchi added, with somewhat less enthusiasm.

"And school. The rhythms of ordinary life resume."

"Today was special though," Tenchi said. "Tanaka-san came, and we talked about Mom, and Hikaru went outside for the first time. Special days are important."

"They are. But ordinary days are important too. Perhaps more important, in the end. Special days stand out because they are rare. Ordinary days are where life actually happens."

The philosophy was complex for a five-year-old, but Tenchi seemed to grasp the essential point. "So both kinds of days matter. The special ones and the regular ones."

"Yes. A life made only of special days would be exhausting. A life made only of ordinary days would be dull. The mixture is what creates a full existence."

"I like the mixture."

"So do I."

---

Bedtime arrived with the natural conclusion of a full day.

Tenchi was tired but content, his body demanding rest after a day of play and exploration and the emotional intensity of memories shared. He prepared for bed with minimal resistance, the evening routine now automatic—brush teeth, change into pajamas, say goodnight to Hikaru through the mudroom door, settle into the futon with Usagi-chan tucked close.

"Today was good," he said, as Sheldon adjusted the blankets. "Really good."

"It was. A good day to mark three weeks."

"Is that why it was good? Because it was three weeks?"

"Perhaps partly. Milestones invite reflection, and reflection helps us appreciate what we have." Sheldon sat beside the futon, his presence part of the routine now. "But I think it would have been a good day regardless. Tanaka's visit, the stories about your mother, Hikaru's first outdoor adventure—these things would have been valuable on any day."

"That's true." Tenchi yawned, his eyes growing heavy. The day's activities were catching up with him, the energy that had seemed limitless now clearly finite. "Tsukino-san? I'm really glad you're here. Like, really really glad."

"I am really really glad to be here."

"Good. Because you belong here now. Like Hikaru. Like me. We all belong together."

"Yes. We all belong together."

"I was scared when you first came. Not scared of you—scared that you would leave. That you would decide you didn't want to stay. That you would go away like—" He stopped, the unfinished sentence carrying its own weight.

"Like your mother."

"Yeah." His voice was small. "I knew she didn't choose to leave. But it still felt like leaving. And I thought maybe you would choose to leave. That we wouldn't be enough to make you want to stay."

"I am not leaving." The words were simple, direct, a repetition of promises made before but no less meaningful for the repetition. "This is my home now. You are my family. I chose this, and I continue to choose it every day."

"Even when I'm annoying?"

"Even then. Family is not conditional on good behavior. It exists through difficulties as well as ease."

"That's what Mom said too. She said love wasn't something you earned—it was something you were given, and the giving mattered more than whether you deserved it."

"Your mother understood love very well."

"I think I understand it better now too. Because of you and Grandpa and Hikaru." Tenchi's eyes were almost closed now, sleep claiming him despite his efforts to continue the conversation. "I love you, Tsukino-san."

"I love you too, Tenchi."

The boy's eyes closed, sleep claiming him mid-thought. His breathing evened out, the tension of wakefulness giving way to the softness of rest. His small hand still rested on Usagi-chan, the stuffed rabbit that had accompanied him through grief and healing.

Sheldon sat for a moment, watching the small chest rise and fall. Three weeks ago, he had not known this boy existed. Now Tenchi's welfare was central to his own sense of purpose, his happiness intertwined with the child's in ways that could not be easily untangled.

This was what it meant to love someone. Not just feeling affection, but allowing your own wellbeing to depend on theirs. It was vulnerability, exposure, risk—and also the only path to meaning that had ever proven reliable.

He rose quietly and left the room, sliding the door closed with careful silence.

---

On the engawa, Katsuhito was waiting.

The old man sat in his usual position, tea before him, eyes on the stars that were beginning to emerge from the darkening sky. He did not turn as Sheldon approached, merely shifted slightly to indicate awareness of his presence.

"He is asleep?"

"Yes. Almost immediately."

"Good. Children need rest to process what they have learned. Today contained much to process."

Sheldon settled beside him, accepting the offered cup of tea. The night was cool but not cold, the spring air carrying the scent of growing things. The forest sounds were gentle—the rustle of small creatures in the underbrush, the distant call of an owl beginning its nightly hunt.

"Three weeks," Katsuhito said again. "You have come far."

"I have had help."

"Everyone has help. The question is what you do with it." The old man's gaze remained on the stars. "You could have wasted the welcome we offered. You could have taken without giving, received without contributing. Many do. They pass through communities accepting kindness, leaving nothing behind, moving on when the welcome wears thin."

"That was never an option I considered."

"No. I could see that from the first day. You arrived with nothing material, but you brought something more important—the willingness to work, to learn, to be useful." He paused. "That is rarer than it should be. Many people, given your circumstances, would have sought to exploit generosity rather than repay it."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps most people simply lack the opportunity. I was given a chance that many never receive—a place willing to accept me, work worth doing, people worth knowing. The question of how I would have behaved without those things is unanswerable."

"A fair point. Circumstances matter. But character matters more. The same circumstances would have produced different results with a different person. I have seen it happen—people given every opportunity who squandered it, people given no opportunities who created them. The external factors shape possibilities, but the internal factors determine outcomes."

They sat in silence for a while, the night deepening around them. The stars wheeled slowly overhead, the same stars that had witnessed centuries of humans sitting on this mountain, contemplating their lives and their places in the world.

"What do you hope for?" Katsuhito asked. "For the next three weeks, the next three months, the next three years?"

The question invited planning, vision, articulation of goals. Sheldon considered carefully before answering, aware that the response would be taken seriously, that Katsuhito asked few questions without purpose.

"In the immediate term, I hope to complete the house restoration. To establish the repair shop. To continue learning from Tanaka and others. To help Tenchi grow and develop in healthy ways." He paused, organizing thoughts that extended further than the practical. "In the longer term... I hope to be useful. To contribute to the community in ways that matter. To build something that continues to have value after I am gone."

"That is a good hope. Modest in scope but significant in impact."

"I learned from my previous life that grand ambitions can lead to small results. Better to aim for meaningful contribution than for recognition."

"A hard-won lesson."

"Very hard. I had to die to learn it."

The statement hung in the air between them, its implications vast and largely unexplored. Katsuhito did not ask for elaboration—the mystery of Sheldon's arrival remained unspoken, respected if not understood. Whatever had brought him here, from wherever he had come, was a topic that had been acknowledged but not examined.

"However you came to be here, you have made good use of the opportunity. That is what matters." The old man rose slowly, his joints protesting the evening chill. "Three weeks down. Many more ahead. Rest well, Sheldon."

"Rest well, Katsuhito."

The use of given names was deliberate, a marker of the intimacy that had developed. They were not merely housemates or employer and worker. They were family, chosen and committed, bound by shared purpose and mutual care. The formality that had characterized their early interactions had given way to something warmer, something that acknowledged their connection without needing constant articulation.

Katsuhito disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars.

Twenty-one days. Three complete weeks. A foundation built, a life beginning to take shape, a purpose emerging from the chaos of arrival.

He thought about what the next weeks would bring. Hashimoto's tatami work, transforming the main room of his house. More tool restoration with Tanaka, each session deepening both skill and relationship. The gradual development of the repair shop concept, from idea to plan to reality. Tenchi's continued growth, each day bringing small changes that accumulated into development.

All of it ordinary. All of it meaningful.

Tomorrow would bring Monday, a new week, the continuation of the patterns that had been established. The ordinary rhythms of a meaningful life would proceed. The building would continue, day by day, one small contribution at a time.

But tonight, there was this: the stars, the silence, the satisfaction of having arrived somewhere worth being. The knowledge that he belonged, that he was wanted, that his presence mattered to people who mattered to him.

Twenty-one days down.

The building continued.

⁂

---

## Day 22

---

## Monday, April 24, 1989

---

Monday arrived with the particular quality of new beginnings.

The fourth week. Three complete weeks behind him, the foundation solid, the patterns established. Now the building continued into new territory—the tatami work starting tomorrow, the house transformation entering its next phase.

Sheldon woke before dawn, as had become his habit. The shrine was quiet, the household still sleeping, the mountain holding its breath before the day's activity began. He dressed and stepped onto the engawa, greeting the morning with the presence that had become ritual.

The sky was lightening in the east, pink and gold bleeding into the grey of pre-dawn. The cherry trees stood in their summer green, the brief glory of blossoms now a memory. Spring was deepening toward summer, the days growing longer, the air warming with each passing week.

Three weeks of mornings on this engawa. Three weeks of watching the sky change, of feeling the air shift, of marking time through observation rather than clocks. The rhythm had become natural, necessary—a way of orienting himself in the world, of confirming his presence in a life that still sometimes felt improbable.

The warmth hummed quietly in his chest, acknowledging another day, another opportunity.

---

Tenchi's morning routine had achieved smooth efficiency.

The boy woke, visited Hikaru, ate breakfast, prepared for school—each step flowing into the next without the resistance that had characterized the early days. The kitten had become fully integrated into the rhythm, his needs anticipated and met as naturally as any other household task.

"Hikaru was really playful this morning," Tenchi reported, settling at the breakfast table. "He caught the mouse toy three times in a row. I think he's getting better at hunting."

"Practice improves performance. He is learning through repetition, just as you learn your lessons through repetition."

"School is different though. Hunting is fun. School is..." He searched for the word. "Necessary."

"An honest assessment. Not everything valuable is enjoyable. Some things must be done because they serve larger purposes, not because they bring immediate pleasure."

"Like eating vegetables?"

"Exactly like eating vegetables. The taste may not appeal, but the nutrition serves the body's needs."

Tenchi accepted this with the resignation of a child who had heard similar reasoning before. He ate his breakfast with steady efficiency, his mind already moving toward the day ahead.

"What are you doing today, Tsukino-san?"

"Shrine work this morning. This afternoon, I will visit the house to prepare for Hashimoto's arrival tomorrow."

"The tatami man is coming?"

"Yes. He will begin replacing the damaged mats. The work will take several days, perhaps longer."

"Can I watch? After school?"

"We can visit together, yes. Though the work itself may not be exciting to observe—it is precise and methodical, not dramatic."

"I like watching people work. It's interesting how they know what to do."

The observation was characteristically thoughtful. Tenchi's curiosity about process, about how things were accomplished, continued to reveal itself in unexpected moments.

"Then we will observe together. Learning by watching is valuable."

The bus horn sounded, and Tenchi departed with a wave that had become automatic—the casual farewell of someone confident in his return, secure in the permanence of his home.

---

The morning's shrine work proceeded with its usual rhythm.

Sheldon swept paths, tended basins, performed the small maintenance tasks that kept the grounds in proper order. The work was meditative now, requiring only partial attention, leaving the rest of his mind free to wander.

He thought about the house. Tomorrow would mark a significant transition—the beginning of visible transformation, the first major work since his arrival. The tatami replacement would change the main room completely, would make the space usable in ways it currently was not.

The repair shop remained a distant goal, but it was becoming less distant. Each step—the tools restored, the tatami replaced, the infrastructure repaired—brought it closer to reality. The village needed someone who could fix things. He was becoming that someone.

Ishikawa was present at the water basin, as expected.

"Good morning," Sheldon said. "Week four begins. The patterns continue."

The frog blinked, apparently unimpressed by calendrical observations.

"Hashimoto begins the tatami work tomorrow. The house will start to become livable. Soon I will have a space of my own, separate from the shrine but connected to it." He changed the water with practiced movements. "Though I wonder if I will actually spend much time there. My life has become centered here, with Tenchi and Katsuhito. The house may end up primarily as a workshop rather than a residence."

Ishikawa offered no opinion on residential arrangements.

"You have the right approach. Stay where the conditions suit you. The water basin serves your needs, so you remain here. The shrine serves my needs, so perhaps I will remain here as well." He considered this. "Though having a space of my own has value regardless of how much time I spend there. Privacy, independence, the ability to work without disturbing others."

The frog hopped into the fresh water, apparently satisfied that the philosophical portion of the morning's conversation had concluded.

---

Mid-morning brought a visitor.

Hashimoto appeared at the shrine entrance, his professional attire marking this as a business call rather than a social visit. He wore traditional work clothes—dark, practical, designed for labor rather than appearance—and carried a leather satchel that presumably contained documents or samples. His expression held the focused attention of someone preparing for significant work.

"Tsukino-san. I wanted to confirm tomorrow's arrangements."

"Of course. Please, come in."

They settled on the engawa with tea, the hospitality protocols observed before business began. Hashimoto accepted the cup with a nod of thanks, but his manner suggested limited patience for extended pleasantries. He was here for a purpose, and that purpose would be served efficiently.

"I will arrive at the house by eight o'clock. The materials will be delivered separately—they should arrive by nine. My supplier is reliable, but I prefer to allow margin for unexpected delays." He sipped his tea, organizing his thoughts. "The first day will primarily involve preparation: removing the damaged mats, assessing the underlying floor, ensuring the space is ready for new installation."

"What should I do to prepare?"

"The room should be empty. Any furniture, any stored items, anything on the floor—all should be removed before my arrival. This saves time and prevents damage to belongings." He paused. "Also, if you have any preferences about mat orientation or pattern, consider them beforehand. Traditional layouts have specific requirements, but within those requirements, choices exist."

"I had not considered orientation."

"Most people do not. But the weave of tatami creates a grain—like wood, in a sense. The direction matters for appearance and for wear. I will advise you when the time comes, but it helps if you have given the matter thought."

"I will think on it."

"Good." Hashimoto sipped his tea, then continued. "The work will take approximately four days, depending on what we find beneath the mats. If the floor requires significant repair, additional time may be needed. I should tell you—in houses of this age, the floor is rarely perfect. Some level of repair is almost always necessary."

"What types of problems are common?"

"Moisture damage, primarily. The traditional construction allows air circulation, but it also allows moisture infiltration during certain conditions. If water has pooled beneath the mats at any point, the floor boards may show rot or warping." He set down his cup, his hands moving to illustrate his explanation. "Also, insect damage. Termites and other wood-boring insects are endemic to this region. Old buildings often show evidence of infestation, even if the insects are no longer active."

"How do you address such damage?"

"It depends on extent. Minor damage—surface rot, superficial boring—can often be repaired in place. Major damage requires board replacement, which adds time and cost but is straightforward work." Hashimoto's expression suggested he had performed such repairs many times. "Structural damage—compromised joists or beams—is more serious, but also rare. The fact that the house has not collapsed suggests its structure is sound."

"That is reassuring."

"It should be. Buildings reveal their nature over time. A house that has stood for decades without major intervention is likely to continue standing. The surface may deteriorate, but the bones remain strong."

"And the cost estimate remains the same?"

"Unless we discover unexpected problems, yes. I have accounted for standard complications in my pricing. Only severe damage would require adjustment." He met Sheldon's eyes directly. "I do not pad my estimates with contingencies. What I quote is what I expect to charge. If problems arise, we will discuss them as they emerge."

The directness was refreshing. Sheldon had encountered enough contractors in his previous life who built ambiguity into their quotes, who left room for expansion and additional charges. Hashimoto's approach was different—clear, honest, confident in his ability to assess a situation accurately.

"Is there anything else I should know?"

"The dust will be significant during removal. Old tatami holds decades of accumulated particles. If you have respiratory sensitivity, consider wearing a mask or remaining outside during that phase." Hashimoto set down his cup. "Also, the new mats will require curing time. You should not walk on them or place furniture for at least one week after installation. This allows the materials to settle properly, the internal structure to find its equilibrium."

"I will remember."

"Good." The tatami maker rose, the meeting apparently concluded. "One more thing. You mentioned during our first conversation that you were considering a repair shop. May I ask what you intend to repair?"

The question surprised Sheldon—it was personal, curious, beyond the scope of their business arrangement. "Initially, small items. Radios, clocks, household appliances. Eventually, perhaps larger things—furniture, tools, whatever the village needs."

"The village needs much." Hashimoto nodded slowly. "Hideo used to fill that role, but he has been gone for years now. People have been making do, or traveling to larger towns, or simply doing without." He paused. "If you can repair things competently, you will not lack for work."

"Tanaka is teaching me tool restoration. I am learning carpentry from books and practice. The skills are accumulating."

"Good. Skills matter. But so does the willingness to serve. Many people have skills but lack the inclination to use them for others. You seem different."

"I hope to be useful."

"That is the right hope." Hashimoto moved toward the path. "Tomorrow, then. Eight o'clock."

"I will be there."

He departed as efficiently as he had arrived, his footsteps purposeful on the stone path. The visit had lasted perhaps twenty minutes, but everything necessary had been communicated—and more besides. The conversation about the repair shop had been brief but significant, another indication that the village was watching, assessing, investing in his potential success.

This was how business was conducted here, Sheldon was learning. Brief, focused, respectful of everyone's time. No unnecessary small talk, no prolonged negotiations, no ambiguity about expectations. But within that efficiency, room existed for genuine connection, for expressions of interest and support that exceeded the transactional minimum.

The clarity was refreshing after a lifetime in academic environments where simple matters could require hours of discussion. But more than that, the warmth was unexpected—the sense that professional relationships could contain personal investment, that competence and care were not mutually exclusive.

---

Lunch was simple, eaten alone.

Katsuhito had departed for some errand in the village, leaving Sheldon to manage the shrine in his absence. The solitude was comfortable rather than lonely—a temporary state, soon to be interrupted by Tenchi's return and the household's evening routines.

Sheldon used the quiet to review his carpentry book, focusing on the chapters about floor repair. Hashimoto had mentioned the possibility of work beneath the tatami, and understanding the principles involved would help him assess any problems that emerged.

The book described various types of floor damage—rot from moisture, warping from temperature changes, insect damage, structural settling. Each type required different approaches, different materials, different expertise. Some repairs were straightforward; others required significant intervention.

The warmth in his chest hummed as he read, the subtle enhancement making the information easier to absorb, the connections between concepts clearer. He was grateful for this aspect of his new existence—the accelerated learning that made skill acquisition faster, the improved retention that preserved what he learned.

Not that the enhancement replaced genuine effort. He still had to read, to study, to practice. The warmth made the process more efficient, not effortless. The distinction mattered.

The afternoon was spent at the house.

Sheldon walked through the village, nodding to those he passed, receiving nods in return. The recognition had become mutual—he knew faces now, could attach names to some, understood the network of relationships that connected families and businesses. The baker's daughter, returning from deliveries. The elderly couple who tended the small shrine at the crossroads. The carpenter's apprentice, carrying materials to some project.

Each acknowledgment was a tiny thread in the fabric of belonging. Three weeks of daily presence had woven him into the community's awareness, had made him a known quantity rather than a stranger.

The house stood as it had for weeks, patient and waiting. The exterior showed no sign of the decay within, the traditional construction maintaining its dignity despite years of neglect. The walls were straight, the roof intact, the proportions pleasing to the eye. Only close inspection revealed the weathering, the small signs of aging that accumulated over time.

But tomorrow would begin changing that. Tomorrow, restoration would become visible. The thought carried a particular weight—the transition from preparation to action, from planning to execution.

He entered through the front door, which still stuck slightly in its frame. This too would eventually require attention—the door adjusted or the frame repaired, the small annoyances addressed as time and resources allowed. For now, it was merely an inconvenience, a reminder of work remaining.

The main room was mostly empty already—the damaged tatami mats had held nothing but dust and memory. But Sheldon checked carefully, moving what little remained. A broken screen that had been propped in a corner, its paper torn and frame warped beyond repair. Fragments of pottery that had accumulated along the walls—pieces of cups or bowls, remnants of a household that had once lived here. Debris that had no purpose but had never been removed.

He sorted the fragments as he worked, separating what might be salvageable from what was clearly rubbish. Some pieces showed the marks of quality—hand-painted designs, careful craftsmanship. These he set aside, thinking that perhaps they could be repaired, or at least preserved as evidence of the house's history. Others were plainly broken, their useful lives clearly over.

The process felt meditative, almost archaeological. He was uncovering the traces of lives that had been lived here, finding the small objects that people had used and valued and ultimately left behind. Each fragment was a story, or the ending of a story—a cup that had held tea for decades before falling and shattering, a bowl that had served countless meals before being abandoned to the dust.

The space felt larger when cleared completely. He could visualize what it would become—a workshop, perhaps, with benches along the walls and tools organized by function. Or a simple living space, if he decided to spend more time here. Or some combination, the specific use to be determined by need rather than predetermined plan.

The windows needed cleaning—grime had accumulated on the glass, filtering the light into something dim and grey. But even dirty, they admitted enough illumination to see the room's bones. The walls were sound, the ceiling intact, the corners square. The house had been well-built, constructed by people who understood how to work with wood and weather.

He examined the tatami mats themselves, now seeing them with the knowledge Hashimoto had provided. The damage was extensive—dark stains indicating water infiltration, frayed edges revealing insect activity, areas of compression where the internal structure had collapsed. In places, the rush covering had worn through entirely, exposing the straw core beneath. These mats had served their purpose for decades, but their useful life was clearly over.

Beneath them, he knew, lay the floor itself—wooden boards that might be sound or might be damaged, that would determine whether the tatami replacement was straightforward or complicated. Tomorrow would reveal what was hidden.

He found himself curious about what lay beneath. The floor had been covered for years, perhaps decades, protected from direct view even as it aged and potentially decayed. It was a kind of mystery, soon to be solved. Whatever the answer—sound boards or damaged ones, minor problems or major repairs—it would bring clarity to the path forward.

The afternoon light shifted as he worked, the sun moving across the sky, the shadows lengthening in the corners of the room. By the time he finished, the space was entirely empty, ready for Hashimoto's assessment.

He stood in the center of the room, turning slowly, taking in the bare walls and damaged mats. Tomorrow, this space would begin its transformation. The old would be removed, the new would be installed, the house would take another step toward becoming what it could be.

The warmth in his chest hummed quietly, acknowledging the progress, the potential, the work ahead.

---

Tenchi returned from school with typical energy.

"Are we going to the house? To see where the tatami man will work?"

"We can visit, yes. But there is not much to see yet—I spent the afternoon clearing the space. The actual work begins tomorrow."

"I still want to see it. I haven't been there since we looked for the kitten supplies."

"That was more than a week ago. It feels longer."

"Because so much has happened. Hikaru, and the forest shrine, and Tanaka-san's visit, and..." He trailed off, apparently realizing he could not list everything. "Just a lot of stuff."

"Indeed. The days have been full."

They walked together through the village, Tenchi's hand finding Sheldon's with the natural ease of established habit. The afternoon was warm, the spring sun lingering longer each day as summer approached. Other children were visible—playing in yards, walking with parents, the ordinary activity of a village at the end of the school day.

"Kenji asked about you today," Tenchi said.

"Oh?"

"He wanted to know where you came from. I said I didn't know exactly, but that you were my family now." The boy's voice was matter-of-fact. "He said that was weird, having family that isn't related to you. I said it wasn't weird at all, it was just different."

"That was a good answer."

"I thought so. He kept asking questions though. About what you do, and why you live at the shrine, and stuff like that."

"What did you tell him?"

"The truth. That you help Grandpa with the shrine, and you're fixing up a house, and you're learning how to repair things." Tenchi shrugged. "He seemed to think it was okay after that. He just didn't understand at first."

"People often do not understand what differs from their experience. It is not unkindness—merely unfamiliarity."

"Yeah. Like how I didn't understand about cats before Hikaru. Now I understand, but before I just didn't know."

The parallel was apt. Understanding emerged from experience, not from explanation. Kenji might not fully comprehend Tenchi's family structure, but the basic facts—work, house, repairs—provided a framework that made sense within his worldview.

They reached the house and entered together, Tenchi examining the cleared space with wide eyes. The room seemed vast without its damaged mats, the wooden floor visible in patches between areas of dirt and debris.

"It's really empty."

"It needs to be empty for the work to begin. Tomorrow, Hashimoto will remove the old mats and examine the floor beneath. If the floor is sound, he can proceed directly to installation. If it requires repair, that must happen first."

"What if it's really bad? What if the whole floor is broken?"

"Then we will deal with that problem. But I do not expect the worst case. The house has survived this long without collapse. Its fundamental structure is likely sound."

Tenchi walked the perimeter of the room, his footsteps careful on the exposed boards where the tatami had been lifted during clearing. "It smells old. Like Grandma's attic used to smell."

"You remember your grandmother's attic?"

"A little. Mom took me there once, when I was really little. It had boxes and old clothes and stuff from a long time ago. It smelled like this—like dust and old paper and... history, I guess."

"That is a good description. Old spaces accumulate the scent of their years. The materials absorb and release what has touched them, creating a kind of olfactory record."

"Ol-factory?"

"Related to smell. The science of how we perceive scents."

"Oh." Tenchi absorbed this, filing it away. "So the house smells like its history. That's kind of nice, actually. Like it's remembering everything that happened here."

The thought was poetic, touching something true about old buildings and the memories they held. Sheldon looked around the empty room with new appreciation—not just a space to be restored, but a container of experiences, of lives lived and choices made over decades.

"When the new tatami is installed, the smell will change. Fresh rush, clean materials. But beneath it, the house will still remember."

"That's good. I don't want it to forget."

"I do not think houses forget. They simply add new layers to what they already hold."

Tenchi absorbed this, his expression thoughtful. "Things can look broken but still be okay underneath. Is that what you mean?"

"Yes. Surface damage often looks worse than it is. The important question is whether the core is intact."

"That's like people, kind of. Sometimes people look sad or angry on the outside, but inside they're still okay. They just need help with the outside part."

The parallel was characteristically insightful. Sheldon smiled at the boy's ability to find connections across domains—a quality he had noticed before, but which continued to impress him.

"That is an excellent observation. Houses and people have more in common than one might expect."

"Mom used to say that taking care of a house was like taking care of a person. You have to feed it and clean it and fix things when they break. And you have to pay attention to it, or it gets sad."

"Houses can get sad?"

"She said they could. That empty houses get lonely, and neglected houses get sick." Tenchi's voice carried the particular weight of remembered wisdom. "This house was lonely for a long time. But now it's not, because you're here."

The observation landed with unexpected force. Sheldon looked around the empty room, seeing it differently—not just a structure to be restored, but a living thing of sorts, patient through years of abandonment, now receiving the attention it needed.

"I hope I can make it happy again."

"You will. You're good at fixing things."

They stood together in the center of the room, surveying the empty space. The afternoon light was beginning to fade, the shadows lengthening in the corners.

"Will you live here? When it's fixed?"

The concern beneath the question was subtle but present. Tenchi had become accustomed to the household as it was, had built his sense of security around its current configuration. Changes, even positive ones, carried the possibility of loss.

"I am not certain yet. My life has become centered at the shrine. But having a space of my own has value, even if I do not use it as a primary residence."

"Like a special place. Just for you."

"Something like that, yes. A workshop, perhaps. A place to do repairs, to work on projects, to have privacy when needed."

"But you'll still sleep at the shrine? With us?"

"I expect so. The shrine is my home. The house will be... an extension. A connected space, but not a replacement."

"Okay." The relief was audible. "Because I like having you there. In the morning, when I wake up, I can hear you moving around. It makes me feel like everything is normal."

"I like being there as well. The sounds of your movements remind me that I am not alone."

Tenchi reached for his hand again, the gesture natural, seeking connection. "We should go back. Hikaru will be wondering where I am."

"He will survive a brief absence. But yes, we should return. Dinner will need preparation soon."

---

Dinner was prepared together, as had become routine.

Katsuhito had returned from his errand with fresh fish from the village market—a gift from someone, apparently, though he did not explain the circumstances in detail. The meal preparation proceeded with the comfortable choreography of established practice, each person knowing their role without instruction.

"The fish is from Yamamoto-san," Katsuhito eventually explained, as they worked. "A thank-you for something I helped with years ago. She remembers such things."

"The same Yamamoto-san who gave us Hikaru?"

"Yes. She is generous with gifts, though she gives the impression of severity." The old man smiled slightly. "Many people are not what they initially appear. Yamamoto-san seems stern, but she watches out for the village's children, remembers old kindnesses, contributes quietly to those in need."

"The village has many such people, it seems."

"Most communities do. The visible leaders receive attention, but the invisible supporters maintain the fabric of daily life." Katsuhito adjusted the heat beneath the fish. "Nakamura-san, for example, is known as the village observer. But few realize how much practical help she provides—meals for the sick, care for the elderly, attention to those who might otherwise be forgotten."

"She brought mochi when I first arrived. To welcome me."

"Yes. But she also does such things without occasion or reason, simply because they are needed." The old man's expression carried respect. "The best people often work unseen. They do not seek recognition, do not announce their contributions. They simply do what is needed, day after day, expecting nothing in return."

"Hashimoto came this morning," Sheldon reported, changing the subject. "To confirm tomorrow's arrangements."

"He is thorough. A good quality in a craftsman."

"He mentioned that the work might reveal problems beneath the tatami. The floor itself may require attention."

"That is often the case with old buildings. What we see is rarely the full extent of what exists." Katsuhito transferred the fish to a serving plate. "But problems can be addressed. The house has survived decades of neglect. A few more days of discovery will not change its essential nature."

"Tenchi made a similar observation. He said the house might look broken but still be okay underneath."

"He is developing wisdom. The ability to distinguish surface from substance is valuable in many contexts." Katsuhito paused in his work. "Where is Tenchi now?"

"Checking on Hikaru. We visited the house together after school."

"He likes to see where you work. It helps him understand what you do when you are not with him."

"He said something interesting. That houses can be lonely, that they can get sad when neglected. He attributed the thought to his mother."

"Kiyone believed many things that most would consider fanciful. But she was not wrong about buildings having... presence. Some spaces feel welcoming, others feel hostile, and the difference is not always explainable by physical factors." The old man's voice carried weight. "Perhaps houses do hold something of those who have lived in them. Perhaps they do respond to attention and care."

"You believe this?"

"I believe that the world contains more than can be measured or explained. The shrine exists to acknowledge forces that science does not address. Why should buildings be different?" He resumed his work, transferring vegetables to a bowl. "But such thoughts are not required for good craftsmanship. One can restore a house for practical reasons while still honoring its invisible dimensions."

Tenchi entered the kitchen, having completed his pre-dinner check on Hikaru. "He's sleeping. He played so much today that he tired himself out."

"Kittens have two modes: intense activity and deep sleep. The transition between them is rapid."

"I'm like that sometimes. Playing really hard, then suddenly being really tired."

"You are. Though your sleep does not arrive quite as suddenly as Hikaru's."

The meal was consumed with the leisurely pace of a household that had nowhere pressing to be. Conversation ranged across topics—the day's events, the upcoming work, observations about the village and its inhabitants.

"Nakamura-san stopped me in the village today," Katsuhito mentioned. "She asked after your progress with the house."

"What did you tell her?"

"That the tatami work begins tomorrow. That the restoration is proceeding according to plan." He paused. "She seemed pleased. The village is invested in your success, it seems."

"Because the village needs someone who can fix things."

"Partly. But also because they have accepted you as a member of the community. Your success reflects on them, validates their acceptance, confirms their judgment." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "Communities are invested in their members. When one succeeds, all benefit—not just practically, but in the confidence that their collective judgment was sound."

"That is a significant responsibility."

"All belonging carries responsibility. The community supports its members, and members support the community. The exchange is mutual, ongoing, essential to both."

The philosophy was familiar now, the articulation of principles that had governed this place for generations. Sheldon was not just joining a community; he was entering an ancient system of reciprocal obligation, becoming part of a fabric woven from countless individual threads.

---

Bedtime arrived with its usual rhythm.

Tenchi was tired from the day, his energy depleted by school and the afternoon's exploration. He submitted to the routine without resistance—bath, pajamas, final check on Hikaru, settling into the futon with Usagi-chan.

"Tomorrow the work starts," he said, as Sheldon adjusted the blankets.

"Tomorrow the work starts. The beginning of visible transformation."

"Will it take a long time?"

"Several days, perhaps a week. Depending on what we discover beneath the old mats."

"And then the floor will be new? Like it never got damaged?"

"The tatami will be new. The floor beneath will be repaired if necessary. When complete, the room will be functional again—usable, beautiful, ready for whatever purpose we choose."

"Like being healed. The house is getting healed."

"Yes. Restoration is a kind of healing. Taking what was damaged and making it whole again."

Tenchi considered this, his eyes growing heavy. "Houses are lucky. They can get new pieces. When people get hurt, they have to heal with the same pieces they have."

"True. Though people can heal in remarkable ways. The body repairs itself constantly, replacing old cells with new. We are, in a sense, constantly being rebuilt from within."

"That's weird but cool."

"It is both."

"Tsukino-san?"

"Yes?"

"I'm glad the house is getting fixed. Because it means you'll stay. You'll have your own place, but you'll still be here. With us."

"I will still be here. That is not in question."

"I know. But sometimes I worry anyway. Not because you've done anything wrong—just because worrying is what brains do sometimes."

"That is true. Brains often worry even when there is no reason to. It is a protective mechanism that sometimes overreacts."

"How do you make it stop?"

"You cannot make it stop entirely. But you can notice when it is happening and remind yourself that the worry does not match reality. Over time, the reminders become easier, and the worry becomes less powerful."

"You do that? Remind yourself?"

"Yes. I worried, in the beginning, that I would not be accepted here. That I would remain an outsider despite my efforts. But each day, I reminded myself that the evidence contradicted the worry—that Katsuhito was welcoming me, that the village was accepting me, that you were including me in your life."

"And now you don't worry?"

"Less. The worry has not disappeared, but it has diminished. The evidence has accumulated, and the fear has found less room to grow."

Tenchi absorbed this, his eyes nearly closed now. "I'll try the reminding thing. When I worry about you leaving or something bad happening. I'll remind myself that everything is okay."

"That is a good practice. And if the reminding is not enough, you can come to me. We can remind each other."

"Yeah." His voice was soft, sleep-thick. "That's what family does. Reminds each other that things are okay."

"Yes. That is what family does."

The boy's eyes closed, sleep claiming him with the swiftness that characterized his evenings. Sheldon sat for a moment, watching the peaceful face, feeling the familiar warmth of affection that had grown so quickly.

Tomorrow would bring change. The tatami work, the house transformation, the visible evidence of progress. But tonight was still, complete, holding its own significance.

He rose and left the room quietly.

---

On the engawa, the stars were emerging.

Katsuhito was absent—already retired, perhaps, or occupied with some private matter. Sheldon sat alone, tea warming his hands, thoughts ranging across the day and the days ahead.

Twenty-two days. The fourth week beginning. The patterns continuing while new elements emerged.

Tomorrow, Hashimoto would arrive at the house. The tatami work would begin. For the first time since his arrival, someone other than himself would be directly contributing to the restoration of the Tsukino property. The work was expanding beyond what one person could accomplish, becoming a collaborative effort that would eventually involve electricians, plumbers, and others.

This too was how things were built. Not by individuals acting alone, but by networks of people contributing their skills, their knowledge, their labor. The house would be restored through the combined efforts of Hashimoto, Tanaka, eventually Watanabe and others. Sheldon's role was to coordinate, to prepare, to learn—but the actual expertise came from elsewhere.

In his previous life, he had valued individual achievement above all else. His papers bore his name, his theories were his own, his reputation was built on what he alone had accomplished. The idea of depending on others, of sharing credit, of being one contributor among many—this had seemed like weakness, like an admission that he could not succeed on his own.

But now he understood differently. The great works were always collaborative, even when attributed to individuals. Every scientist stood on the shoulders of predecessors. Every craftsman learned from masters. Every achievement emerged from a web of connections, even if only one name was remembered.

He thought about the conversation at dinner—Katsuhito's mention of the invisible supporters who maintained the community's fabric. Yamamoto-san with her quiet generosity. Nakamura-san with her practical help. Countless others who did what was needed without seeking recognition.

The house restoration would not bear his name in any formal sense. Hashimoto would not credit him for the tatami work. Tanaka would not acknowledge his assistance with the tools. But the restoration would happen, the house would be restored, the repair shop would eventually open—and all of it would emerge from the collaborative effort of many people working toward a shared goal.

And in turn, Sheldon would contribute to others' goals. He would repair their radios, their clocks, their broken tools. He would maintain the shrine, support Tenchi's growth, participate in the community's life. The exchanges were not transactional, not balanced accounts of give and take. They were something more fluid, more organic—a continuous flow of contribution and support that sustained everyone involved.

This was enough. This was, perhaps, everything.

He thought about Tenchi's observation—that family reminded each other that things were okay. Such a simple formulation, but it captured something essential. The worry that lived in everyone's mind, the fear that things might fall apart, the uncertainty about the future—all of it was held in check by the reminders that others provided. You matter. You belong. Things are okay.

He had not had this in his previous life. No one to remind him that things were okay, no one to notice when his worry grew, no one to provide the reassurance that came from genuine connection. He had managed his fears alone, and they had grown unchecked, until he had died alone in an office that no one entered until his body was discovered days later.

That would not happen here. He was known now, observed, connected. If he disappeared for a day, people would notice. If he struggled, people would help. The community had claimed him, and with that claim came both obligation and protection.

The warmth hummed its quiet agreement.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep. Tomorrow would bring work, progress, the continuation of the building.

Twenty-two days down.

The building continued.

⁂

## Day 23

---

## Tuesday, April 25, 1989

---

The day began before dawn, anticipation driving Sheldon from sleep earlier than usual.

Today marked the beginning of visible transformation—the first professional work on the house, the transition from planning to action. Hashimoto would arrive at eight o'clock, materials would follow, and the tatami removal would reveal what lay beneath decades of neglect.

Sheldon dressed quickly and stepped onto the engawa, greeting the morning with a mixture of eagerness and apprehension. Whatever the floor revealed—sound boards or damaged ones, minor problems or major complications—would determine the restoration's trajectory. The uncertainty was almost pleasant, the kind of suspense that preceded discovery.

The sky lightened slowly, pink and gold bleeding into the grey of pre-dawn. The shrine was quiet, the household still sleeping, the mountain holding its breath before the day's activity began.

The warmth hummed in his chest, acknowledging the significance of the day ahead.

---

Breakfast was hurried, the schedule demanding early departure.

"You are leaving before Tenchi wakes?" Katsuhito asked.

"I need to be at the house by eight. Hashimoto will not appreciate tardiness."

"He will not. Punctuality is among his many virtues." The old man poured tea with his usual deliberate movements. "I will explain to Tenchi when he wakes. He will want to visit after school."

"I expected as much. The work may be dusty and disruptive, but he should see it if he wishes."

"He wishes everything. His curiosity is boundless."

"A good quality, properly directed."

"Agreed." Katsuhito handed over the tea cup. "Report on what you find. The floor's condition will determine much."

"I will send word, or return myself if the news is significant."

The tea was consumed quickly, the breakfast minimal. Sheldon gathered what he might need—work clothes, a notebook for observations, water for the morning—and set off while the household was still waking.

The walk to the house was familiar now, the path through the village etched in memory. Few people were about at this hour, but those who were acknowledged him with nods—the baker beginning her day's work, an elderly man tending his garden, the rhythms of village life stirring to wakefulness.

---

Hashimoto was already present when Sheldon arrived.

The tatami maker stood before the house, examining the exterior with the professional attention of someone assessing a workspace. His truck was parked nearby, tools visible in the bed, the organized arrangement of a craftsman who knew exactly what he needed.

"You are early," Hashimoto observed. "Good."

"I wanted to be ready."

"The materials will arrive within the hour. Until then, we can begin preparation." He moved toward the entrance without waiting for response, expecting Sheldon to follow. "The first task is removing the old mats. This is labor, not craft—physical work requiring care but not special skill."

"I can help with the removal."

"That is why you are here." A slight smile touched Hashimoto's features—the closest he came to warmth. "I do not bring clients to labor sites unless they intend to contribute."

They entered the main room together, the space exactly as Sheldon had left it the previous afternoon—empty of furniture, ready for work. Morning light filtered through the dirty windows, illuminating the damaged tatami mats with their stains and worn surfaces.

"We remove them in order," Hashimoto explained. "Starting from the edges, working toward the center. Each mat is numbered in traditional installation—the pattern matters for proper replacement." He produced a pencil and began marking the mats with small numbers. "We will preserve the layout, even though the mats themselves are beyond repair."

"The new mats will follow the same pattern?"

"Yes. Tatami layout is not arbitrary—it follows rules developed over centuries. The way mats fit together, the direction of the weave, the relationship between adjacent pieces—all of this has meaning." Hashimoto completed his numbering and straightened. "Some modern installers ignore these traditions. I do not."

"I appreciate the attention to proper method."

"You should. It is why my work lasts, why my clients return, why my reputation endures." He moved to the first mat. "Now. We lift together."

---

The removal was harder than Sheldon had anticipated.

The mats had settled over years, their edges compressed into the frames, their undersides adhered to the floor beneath through accumulated moisture and debris. Each mat required effort—loosening the edges, prying up the corners, lifting the heavy panels of rice straw and rush.

"Traditional tatami weighs approximately thirty kilograms," Hashimoto explained, as they maneuvered the first mat toward the door. "The core is compressed rice straw, layered and bound. The weight gives stability—the mats do not shift under foot—but it also makes installation and removal labor-intensive."

The dust was exactly as Hashimoto had warned—clouds of it rising with each disturbance, filling the air with the accumulated particles of decades. Sheldon's eyes watered, his throat protested, but the work continued steadily. They developed a rhythm: loosen, lift, carry, stack. Repeat.

"Old houses hold their histories," Hashimoto observed, as they set aside the third mat. "The dust contains skin cells, fabric fibers, remnants of meals, particles of smoke. Everything that happened in this room left traces."

"That is either poetic or unsettling."

"Both. Houses are archives, though most people prefer not to think about what they contain." He paused to wipe sweat from his forehead. "I once removed mats from a house that had been used as a sake brewery. The rush had absorbed the smell so thoroughly that the entire stack reeked of fermented rice. Pleasant, in its way—but impossible to ignore."

"What happened to those mats?"

"Disposed of, like these. The smell could not be removed, and no one wants their home to smell like a brewery." A slight smile. "Though I admit I kept one piece, as a curiosity. It still smells faintly of sake, years later."

The work continued, each mat revealing more of the floor beneath. By mid-morning, half the room was exposed, the wooden boards visible for the first time in years.

The floor's condition was... mixed. Some areas appeared sound—the wood darkened with age but intact, the grain visible, the structure solid. The original boards were wide and well-fitted, their edges meeting precisely, evidence of skilled carpentry from an earlier era.

Other areas showed clear damage—stains indicating water infiltration, the wood discolored in patterns that traced the paths moisture had taken. Soft spots where rot had begun, the surface yielding slightly under pressure. Evidence of insect activity in the form of tiny holes and sawdust residue, the telltale signs of beetles or termites that had visited sometime in the past.

"Worse than I hoped, better than I feared," Hashimoto pronounced, after they had removed six mats. "The damage is concentrated near the exterior wall—likely where water entered during storms. Perhaps a leak in the roof, or simply wind-driven rain penetrating gaps in the construction. The central area appears sound."

"Can it be repaired?"

"Yes. The damaged boards can be replaced without disturbing the sound ones. It will add time and cost, but the work is straightforward." He knelt to examine a particularly damaged section, pressing the wood with expert fingers. "This board must come out. The rot has penetrated too deeply for surface treatment. See here—" He pressed again, and Sheldon could see the wood compress slightly. "Healthy wood does not yield like that. This is compromised throughout."

Sheldon watched as Hashimoto assessed each section of exposed floor, his expertise evident in the speed and confidence of his evaluations. The tatami maker could read damage like text, interpreting stains and textures and compressions with a fluency that came from years of practice.

"How many boards require replacement?"

"Perhaps a dozen. More may become apparent as we continue." Hashimoto rose and brushed dust from his knees. "The materials delivery will include repair lumber. I anticipated this possibility."

"You expected to find damage?"

"In a house this age, with this history of neglect? I would have been surprised to find none." His expression carried something between amusement and resignation. "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. It is how one survives in this trade."

They continued the removal, the remaining mats yielding to their combined effort. By the time the floor was fully exposed, the pattern of damage was clear—a corridor of decay along the western wall, spreading inward in diminishing intensity. The center and eastern portions were sound, their wood solid despite the years.

"The original builders oriented the house well," Hashimoto observed. "The prevailing storms come from the west. They positioned the strongest construction on that side, but even strength eventually yields to persistent assault." He swept his gaze across the exposed floor. "Still, this is workable. The house is not doomed—merely wounded."

---

The materials arrived mid-morning.

A truck pulled up bearing stacks of new tatami mats, wrapped in protective covering, accompanied by lumber for floor repairs and the various supplies needed for installation. The driver was familiar with Hashimoto—they exchanged brief greetings and coordinated the unloading with practiced efficiency.

Sheldon helped carry the materials, noting their weight and organization. The new mats were heavy—heavier than the old ones had been, compressed and solid with fresh materials. Each was wrapped in paper to protect the rush surface, labeled with numbers that corresponded to Hashimoto's installation plan.

"These are the mats we discussed," Hashimoto told Sheldon, as they carried the first stack into the house. "Premium quality, properly cured. The rush is from the Kumamoto region—the best in Japan."

"What makes it best?"

"Climate, soil, tradition. The farmers there have cultivated rush for generations. They know which strains grow strongest, which harvesting times produce the best material, which drying methods preserve flexibility without weakness." Hashimoto set down his end of the stack with care. "The rush is harvested in summer, when the plants are at their peak. Too early, and the fibers are weak. Too late, and they become brittle. The timing must be precise."

"How do they know when the moment is right?"

"Experience. The color changes subtly as the rush matures—the experienced eye can read it. And the texture of the leaves, the feel of the stem when pressed. Knowledge that cannot be fully articulated, only learned through years of observation." Hashimoto straightened. "My supplier's family has grown rush for five generations. When he says the harvest was good, I trust him absolutely."

"Tanaka says similar things about steel."

"Tanaka is correct. All craftsmen know this truth, though we express it differently." The next stack was retrieved, the process repeated. "The best work requires the best materials, the best tools, the best techniques. Compromise any element, and the result suffers."

"And the rice straw core?"

"Also carefully sourced. The straw must be from healthy plants, properly dried, free of mold or contamination. I compress it myself—many modern makers use foam cores, which are lighter and cheaper but lack the feel, the resilience, the living quality of traditional construction." Hashimoto's voice carried mild contempt for this shortcut. "A proper tatami breathes. It absorbs humidity in summer, releases it in winter. Foam cannot do this."

The unloading continued until the new mats and repair supplies filled a corner of the room, neatly organized and ready for use. The lumber for floor repairs was stacked separately—boards cut to standard widths, their surfaces smooth and pale, awaiting installation. Tools were arranged in order of use, the craftsman's habit of preparation evident in every detail.

The old mats, now fully removed, were stacked outside for disposal—their useful life definitively ended. Sheldon paused to examine one, its surface worn nearly smooth in places, the rush fibers compressed and darkened by years of use.

"These were good mats once," Hashimoto said, noting his attention. "You can see the quality in the weave, the density of the original construction. They served well for many years before neglect took its toll."

"Is there any use for them now?"

"Farmers sometimes use old tatami as mulch—the straw core breaks down and enriches soil. Or they can be burned, though the ash is acidic and must be used carefully." He shrugged. "Most simply go to disposal. The useful components cannot be separated economically."

The exposed floor lay bare for inspection, the full extent of its condition now visible. Hashimoto walked the perimeter slowly, testing each board with his foot, noting areas that required attention. His movements were systematic, methodical—the practiced routine of someone who had assessed hundreds of floors.

"The damage is less extensive than it appeared initially," he reported, completing his circuit. "Eight boards require replacement, not twelve. The others can be treated and preserved."

"That is good news."

"It is. The floor's core is sound—the original builders knew their craft. Only the areas where moisture penetrated show significant decay." He marked the damaged boards with chalk for later removal—large X marks that stood out against the darkened wood. "We will address the repairs today, allow the new wood to settle overnight, then begin mat installation tomorrow."

"Why must it settle?"

"New wood expands and contracts as it adjusts to its environment. Installing mats immediately risks having the boards shift beneath them, creating unevenness or gaps. A night's settling allows the worst of the adjustment to occur before we cover it." Hashimoto began gathering tools for the repair work—a saw, chisels of various sizes, a pry bar, a mallet. "The difference is subtle but meaningful. Patience in the early stages prevents problems in the final result."

"The timeline remains on track?"

"Roughly. We will complete by Friday rather than Thursday, but the delay is minimal." He selected a chisel and tested its edge with his thumb. "You may assist with the board removal if you wish. It is good practice for someone interested in restoration."

"I would appreciate that."

"Then come. I will show you how to extract a damaged board without disturbing its neighbors."

---

The floor repair was precise work.

Hashimoto demonstrated each step with the methodical patience of a natural teacher—how to identify the board's attachment points, how to cut along the edges without damaging adjacent wood, how to pry up the damaged section cleanly.

"The old builders used wooden pegs, not nails," he explained. "This makes extraction easier but requires different techniques. You must feel for the pegs, work around them, remove the board in alignment with how it was originally installed."

He positioned his chisel at the board's edge, angled precisely, and tapped it with the mallet. A thin line appeared in the accumulated grime, marking the seam between boards.

"The joints have compressed over time, sealing themselves shut. We must open them without splitting the wood." Another tap, the chisel moving a few centimeters. "Patience. Force creates cracks. Patience creates clean separations."

Sheldon watched the process intently, absorbing the technique. The chisel worked its way around the board's perimeter, loosening decades of accumulated fit. Then Hashimoto switched to the pry bar, inserting it into the opened seam.

"Now we lift, but not directly upward. The pegs are angled—pulling straight up will break them and damage the joist beneath. We lift at a slant, following the peg's direction." He demonstrated, applying pressure at an angle. The board shifted, rose slightly, then came free with a soft grinding sound.

"Like removing a splinter," Sheldon observed. "Going with the grain rather than against it."

"Exactly so. The principle applies universally—work with the material's nature, not against it." Hashimoto set the damaged board aside and examined the exposed area. "The joists are sound. The damage did not penetrate to the structural level."

"How can you tell?"

"Color, texture, the way the wood responds to pressure. Healthy wood resists firmly; damaged wood gives. Healthy wood retains its natural color; damaged wood darkens or lightens depending on the type of decay." He demonstrated, pressing on the joist with his palm. "See? Solid. This house will stand for another century if properly maintained."

The first damaged board removed, Hashimoto handed Sheldon the chisel. "Your turn. The next board, using the technique I showed you."

Sheldon took the tool, feeling its weight and balance. The handle was worn smooth from years of use, the metal edge honed to precise sharpness. He positioned it at the board's edge, mimicking Hashimoto's angle.

"Good. Now tap—gently. Let the tool do the work."

The mallet struck, the chisel bit into the seam. Sheldon felt the wood's resistance, adjusted his angle slightly, tapped again. Progress was slow but visible, the seam opening millimeter by millimeter.

"You have good instincts," Hashimoto observed. "Many people rush, try to force the pace. You are working at the wood's speed, not your own."

"Tanaka taught me that force is the enemy of good work."

"He taught you well. Continue."

The remaining damaged boards were removed one by one, the process becoming more familiar with each repetition. Sheldon's hands learned the correct pressure, the right angles, the feel of wood releasing its grip. By the fourth board, he could identify the peg locations by subtle sounds—the slightly different tone the chisel made when it encountered the harder material.

"You learn quickly," Hashimoto observed, as the final board came free. "Not everyone does. Some people cannot translate instruction into action—their bodies do not cooperate with their minds."

"I have good teachers."

"Teaching matters, but so does aptitude. You have both." He began arranging the replacement lumber, selecting boards that matched the original dimensions. "The new boards are cut to size. We will fit them now, secure them, and allow the floor to stabilize before morning."

"Should the new wood be treated differently than the original?"

"The sealant will protect it from moisture. But otherwise, no—we want it to behave like the surrounding wood, to expand and contract in harmony with its neighbors. Using dramatically different materials creates stress points." Hashimoto measured the opening left by the removed board, compared it to the replacement. "This one will need trimming. A few millimeters."

He made the cut with practiced efficiency—a thin shaving of wood falling away to reveal the board's final dimension. The fit was tested, found satisfactory, and the board was secured with wooden pegs that Hashimoto carved from scrap material.

"New pegs for new boards. The old ones may have carried contamination from the damaged wood." He drove each peg home with careful taps. "Everything that contacts the rot must be replaced."

---

Lunch was simple, eaten in the yard outside the house.

Hashimoto had brought rice balls and pickled vegetables—enough for two, as though he had expected Sheldon's participation from the beginning. They sat on upturned buckets in the spring sunshine, eating in the comfortable silence of workers taking a necessary break.

The air was fresh after the dusty interior work, the breeze carrying scents of growing things. From this vantage point, Sheldon could see the village stretching below—rooftops and gardens, the familiar geometry of a community built over generations.

"The house has good bones," Hashimoto said, between bites. "The original construction was excellent. Only neglect allowed the damage we found."

"How long was it empty?"

"I am not certain. Years, certainly. Perhaps a decade or more." He considered, chewing thoughtfully. "The Tsukino family—they were craftsmen once. The last generation had no heirs interested in continuing the trade. The house passed through various hands, none of whom maintained it properly."

"You knew the family?"

"By reputation. My father knew them better—he made tatami for this house, in fact, many years ago. The previous set, the one we are replacing." Hashimoto gestured toward the discarded mats. "Those mats were his work, installed when I was perhaps twelve years old. I helped carry them."

"Then there is a family connection to this restoration."

"In a sense. My father would be pleased to know I am continuing what he began—maintaining a house he once served." A slight smile. "Craftsmanship creates such connections. The things we make outlive us, carry forward our work into futures we never see."

"The Tsukino family—what can you tell me about them?"

"They were known for furniture—tables, chests, fine pieces that wealthy families commissioned. The work was highly valued. My father said their joinery was exceptional, their sense of proportion impeccable." Hashimoto's voice carried respect for fellow craftsmen. "But the children pursued other paths. The craft died with the last master."

"What happened to them?"

"Scattered, I believe. The children moved to cities, took modern employment. The house was sold to pay debts—perhaps medical expenses for the aging parents, or simply the costs of maintaining a property none of them wanted." He shrugged. "A common story. Traditional crafts struggle to find successors. The young prefer salaries and stability to apprenticeships and uncertainty."

"I hope to restore some of that purpose. The repair shop."

"Yes. You mentioned that yesterday." The tatami maker studied him for a moment, his weathered face thoughtful. "It is good that someone will work in this space again. Houses deteriorate faster when empty—as though they need occupation to maintain their vitality."

"Tenchi said something similar. That houses can be lonely."

"A child's wisdom. Sometimes children see truths that adults have learned to overlook." Hashimoto finished his rice ball and brushed crumbs from his hands. "My grandmother used to say that houses have spirits—not ghosts, exactly, but presences. The accumulated essence of everyone who lived there. When a house is abandoned, the spirit grows restless."

"Do you believe that?"

"I believe that houses respond to occupation. Whether through spirits or simply through the effects of human presence—the warmth, the movement, the maintenance that comes from daily use—I cannot say. The result is the same." He rose, indicating that the break was ending. "The house will welcome your work. It has waited long enough."

---

The afternoon brought the completion of floor repairs.

The new boards were fitted with precision, their surfaces planed to match the existing floor, their edges joined seamlessly to the surrounding wood. Hashimoto insisted on perfection—any gap, any unevenness, any visible transition between old and new was corrected before proceeding.

"The floor must be level for the tatami to sit properly," he explained. "Any variation in the underlying surface will translate to the finished work. Tatami requires a flat foundation."

"How much variation is acceptable?"

"Ideally, none. In practice, we can accommodate perhaps two millimeters across a mat's width. More than that, and the mat will not lie flat, will shift under foot, will wear unevenly." He ran a straightedge across the repaired section, checking for deviations. "This is within tolerance."

Sheldon watched as Hashimoto made minute adjustments—a shaving of wood here, a slight repositioning there. The work was meticulous, almost obsessive, but the results spoke for themselves. The repaired sections blended into the surrounding floor as though they had always been there.

"You will not see the repairs once the mats are installed," Hashimoto said, noting Sheldon's attention. "But I will know they are done properly. That matters more than visibility."

"Pride in work that no one will see."

"The foundation of all true craftsmanship. If you only do good work when others are watching, you are not a craftsman—you are a performer." He secured the final board with its wooden pegs. "The hidden work determines the visible result. Always."

The final board was secured, the last of the repairs complete. The floor now lay bare and ready—a patchwork of old and new wood, darkened original boards alongside lighter replacements, the whole surface level and solid.

"We will apply a sealant to the new boards," Hashimoto said. "This prevents moisture absorption, protects against future damage. The original boards do not need treatment—they have acquired their own protection over time."

"Through age?"

"Through use. Oils from feet, from cleaning, from simple exposure to air. The wood has developed a patina that resists moisture naturally. The new boards lack this protection and are vulnerable until they acquire it." He prepared the sealant—a clear liquid with a sharp chemical smell. "This provides immediate protection. Over years, the boards will develop their own defenses and the sealant will become less necessary."

The sealant was brushed on carefully, each new board receiving multiple coats while the surrounding areas were protected from drips. Hashimoto worked with steady efficiency, his brush strokes economical and precise.

"The sealant will cure overnight. Tomorrow, we begin mat installation." Hashimoto cleaned his brush with practiced efficiency, wrapping it in cloth for transport. "The work will proceed quickly now. The difficult part is complete."

"Discovering what lay beneath was the difficult part?"

"Always. The uncertainty, the potential for disaster, the possibility that hidden damage might require complete rebuilding—that is what makes restoration challenging. Once the problems are known, addressing them is merely labor." He began gathering tools for departure. "The best craftsmen embrace uncertainty. They find satisfaction in discovery, even when the discoveries are unwelcome."

"And when the discoveries are welcome?"

"Then we give thanks and proceed with gratitude." He paused, looking around the transformed room. "Today's discoveries were welcome. The house has cooperated with our efforts. That is not always the case."

---

Tenchi arrived as Hashimoto was preparing to leave.

The boy appeared at the yard's edge, school bag still on his back, having clearly come directly from the bus stop. His eyes were wide as he took in the scene—the stacked old mats, the organized new ones, the transformed interior visible through the open door.

"You started!" His voice carried excitement and perhaps a hint of reproach at having missed the beginning.

"We started. Come, I will show you what we found."

Hashimoto paused in his departure, watching as Tenchi entered the house and examined the exposed floor with obvious fascination.

"It's all different colors," Tenchi observed. "Like a puzzle that got mixed up."

"The darker boards are original. The lighter ones are new—replacements for boards that were damaged."

"Why were they damaged?"

"Water, primarily. And insects, and time. The house is old, and old things accumulate wear."

Tenchi knelt to touch the floor, his small hand exploring the surface with curious attention. "It feels smooth. Smoother than before."

"Hashimoto-san prepared it for the new tatami. The surface must be level."

"Hi, Hashimoto-san." Tenchi had noticed the tatami maker waiting by the door. "Thank you for fixing the floor."

"You are welcome, young man." Hashimoto's stern expression softened slightly. "The house is being restored. Tomorrow, the new mats will be installed, and the room will be transformed."

"Can I watch? Please?"

"You will be at school when the work occurs."

"After school then. Can I see the finished room?"

"If your guardian permits, you may visit when we are done." Hashimoto glanced at Sheldon, received a nod of confirmation. "The work should be complete by late afternoon."

"Thank you!" Tenchi's enthusiasm was genuine, infectious. "I want to see everything."

"Everything may not be visible by then. But you will see the result." Hashimoto shouldered his tool bag. "Until tomorrow, Tsukino-san. Eight o'clock."

"Eight o'clock. Thank you for today's work."

The tatami maker departed, his truck rumbling to life and disappearing down the village road. Tenchi remained in the house, continuing his exploration of the transformed space.

"It smells different," he said. "Chemical-y."

"The sealant on the new boards. It will fade as it cures."

"And then it'll smell like new tatami?"

"Yes. Fresh rush, clean materials. A new smell for a renewed room."

Tenchi stood in the center of the floor, turning slowly to take in the space. "It's really happening. The house is really getting fixed."

"It is really happening. Day by day, step by step."

"Like building the fort. Except bigger."

"Much bigger. And with more help."

"That's okay though. Big things need more help. That's why people work together."

The observation was simple but accurate. Sheldon smiled at the boy's continuing ability to find essential truths in ordinary observations.

"Yes. That is exactly why people work together."

---

They returned to the shrine together, Tenchi's hand in Sheldon's as they walked.

The boy's questions continued throughout the journey—about the floor damage, about the repair process, about what the room would look like when complete. Sheldon answered each one, describing what he had learned, sharing Hashimoto's expertise in simplified form.

"He knows so much about floors," Tenchi said. "Like you know about fixing things, and Tanaka-san knows about tools."

"Everyone who commits to a craft develops deep knowledge. Years of practice, of observation, of problem-solving accumulate into expertise."

"Will you know things like that someday? About your repair shop?"

"I hope so. Learning is ongoing—there is always more to understand, more to practice, more to discover."

"That's kind of cool. Never running out of things to learn."

"It can also be overwhelming. The amount of knowledge that exists exceeds any one person's capacity to absorb it. We must choose what to learn, which areas to pursue deeply."

"How do you choose?"

"Need, interest, opportunity. I learn what I need to solve immediate problems. I pursue what interests me for its own sake. I accept what opportunities present themselves." Sheldon considered. "Hashimoto appeared, offering to teach about tatami and floors. Tanaka appeared, offering to teach about tools. The village presented needs that I might be able to meet. The choices emerge from circumstance as much as from intention."

"So you just... let things happen? And then learn from them?"

"Partly. But I also prepare myself to recognize opportunities when they arise. Someone less observant might have missed Tanaka's offer, or failed to appreciate what Hashimoto could teach. Readiness matters as much as circumstance."

"Be ready for stuff, and then stuff happens."

"Approximately, yes."

The shrine came into view, the familiar gates and paths welcoming their return. Hikaru would be waiting in the mudroom, Katsuhito would want to hear about the day's discoveries, the household would resume its evening rhythms.

"I like today," Tenchi declared. "Even though I missed the beginning, I liked seeing what happened."

"There will be more to see tomorrow. The mat installation will be the most visible transformation yet."

"And then the room will be done?"

"The room will be functional. Done is a larger concept—there is always more that could be improved, more that could be refined. But functional is a meaningful milestone."

"Functional is good enough for now."

"Functional is excellent for now."

---

Dinner was a celebration of progress.

Katsuhito had prepared a slightly more elaborate meal than usual—grilled fish with special sauce, fresh vegetables, rice with additions that elevated it beyond the everyday. The effort acknowledged the day's significance without being ostentatious.

"The floor repairs are complete," Sheldon reported. "Eight boards replaced, the remainder treated and preserved. Hashimoto believes the underlying structure is sound."

"That is welcome news. Major structural damage would have complicated everything."

"He said the original builders knew their craft. The house was well-made from the beginning—only neglect allowed the decay we found."

"The Tsukino craftsmen had excellent reputations. Furniture makers, primarily, but they understood construction broadly." Katsuhito served the fish with careful attention. "It is appropriate that you are restoring their house. Different craft, but related principles."

"Hashimoto made similar observations. He seemed pleased that the space would be used for work again."

"He would be. Craftsmen understand the importance of continued use. Tools that sit idle deteriorate. Skills that go unpracticed fade. Spaces that remain empty lose their vitality." The old man's voice carried conviction. "The house will benefit from your occupation, just as you will benefit from its shelter."

Tenchi had been following the conversation with partial attention, most of his focus on the food before him. "The floor looks like a puzzle," he contributed. "Old pieces and new pieces mixed together."

"An apt description. Restoration often creates such mosaics—the original preserved where possible, the damaged replaced where necessary. The result is neither entirely old nor entirely new, but something between."

"Is that good?"

"It is honest. The house carries its history visibly, acknowledges the work that has been done, does not pretend to be something it is not." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "Some prefer pristine restoration—everything returned to an idealized original state. I prefer work that shows its nature, that reveals rather than conceals."

"Like scars," Tenchi said. "People have scars that show what happened to them. Maybe houses can too."

"An excellent analogy. Yes, houses can have scars—and those scars tell stories, just as human ones do."

The meal continued with comfortable conversation, the day's work providing material for discussion. Tenchi wanted to know every detail of the damage they had found, the techniques they had used, the progress they had made.

"The boards just came up?" he asked. "Like puzzle pieces?"

"With persuasion. Hashimoto-san showed me how to use chisels and pry bars properly—working with the wood's grain rather than against it."

"Like Tanaka-san teaches."

"Exactly like Tanaka-san teaches. The principle is universal."

Katsuhito nodded approvingly. "All true craft follows the same underlying philosophy. Work with the material, not against it. Respect what exists. Build upon foundations rather than destroying them."

"Hashimoto mentioned that his father made the previous tatami for this house," Sheldon added. "The ones we removed today. There is a generational continuity to the work."

"Such connections are common in village life. The same families serve the same houses across decades, sometimes centuries. My family has tended the shrine for over seven hundred years." The old man's voice carried quiet pride. "The Hashimoto family has made tatami for nearly as long."

"It creates a kind of relationship—craftsman to client across time."

"More than relationship. Obligation. Responsibility. The current generation inherits the commitments of their predecessors." Katsuhito paused to eat. "When Hashimoto repairs this floor, he honors his father's work as well as his own. When you restore the house, you take on responsibility for maintaining what others built. These are not casual connections."

Tenchi absorbed this silently, his expression thoughtful. "So when I'm grown up, I'll have to take care of the shrine? Like you do?"

"If you choose to. The responsibility can be accepted or declined—it is not forced upon anyone." Katsuhito's voice was gentle. "But understanding what you might inherit helps prepare you for that choice, should you wish to make it."

"I think I want to," Tenchi said. "Not yet, because I'm small. But someday."

"Someday is a fine time to decide. For now, finish your vegetables."

---

Bedtime brought the day to its natural conclusion.

Tenchi was tired from school and the excitement of visiting the house, his energy depleted despite the abbreviated nature of his involvement. He submitted to the routine willingly, settling into his futon with Usagi-chan as his companion.

"Tomorrow the mats go in," he said, as Sheldon adjusted the blankets. "Real tatami. New and clean."

"Yes. Hashimoto will install them according to proper pattern. The room will be transformed."

"Will it look different? Really different?"

"Very different. The floor is currently bare wood—a patchwork of repairs and preservation. Tomorrow, it will be covered in fresh rush mats, uniform and beautiful. The room will feel different as well—softer underfoot, quieter, more welcoming."

"I can't wait to see it."

"You will see it tomorrow afternoon. Hashimoto said the work should be complete by then."

Tenchi yawned, his eyes growing heavy. "Tsukino-san? I'm glad the house is getting fixed. Not just because of the repair shop, but because... because it was sad before. Empty and lonely. Now it won't be."

"The house has purpose again. That matters to places, just as it matters to people."

"Everything needs purpose. You said that before."

"I believe it. Purpose gives meaning, direction, reason for existence. Without purpose, things drift—houses deteriorate, people stagnate, communities decline."

"What's your purpose? Right now, I mean."

The question was direct, significant. Sheldon considered carefully before answering.

"Right now, my purpose is many things. To help restore the house. To learn skills that will make me useful. To care for you and support your growth. To contribute to this household and this community." He paused. "Each purpose connects to the others. They form a network, a web of meaning that holds my life together."

"That sounds nice. Having lots of purposes that all connect."

"It is nice. For many years, I had only one purpose—my work, my research. When that purpose was removed, I had nothing. Now I have many, and the loss of any one would not destroy me."

"Because the others would still be there."

"Exactly. The web remains strong even if individual strands break."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this explanation. His eyes closed, sleep claiming him with the usual swiftness.

Sheldon sat for a moment, watching the peaceful face, feeling the warmth of connection that had become so essential to his existence. Then he rose and left the room quietly.

---

On the engawa, the stars were bright.

Twenty-three days. The first day of actual construction work on the house, beyond the preparation and planning. Hashimoto's skilled hands had transformed the floor from damaged uncertainty to repaired readiness. Tomorrow would bring further transformation.

The work was proceeding. The building was continuing. The life was taking shape.

Sheldon sat until the cold drove him inside, then prepared for sleep.

Twenty-three days down.

The building continued.

⁂

---

## Day 24

---

## Wednesday, April 26, 1989

---

The morning arrived with the promise of completion.

Sheldon woke before dawn, anticipation drawing him from sleep with the same eagerness that had marked the previous day. Today the mats would be installed, the room would be transformed, the first major milestone of the restoration would be achieved.

The warmth hummed in his chest, resonating with the significance of what lay ahead. Not just a physical change—the covering of bare boards with new tatami—but a symbolic one. The house was becoming a place again, not merely a space.

He dressed and stepped onto the engawa, breathing the cool morning air. The sky was lightening in the east, pink and gold bleeding through the clouds. The shrine was quiet, the household still sleeping, but Sheldon's mind was already at the house, imagining the work to come.

---

Breakfast was again hurried, the early departure necessary.

"You are eager," Katsuhito observed, pouring tea with his usual deliberation. "This is the third morning you have risen before me."

"The work requires early attendance. Hashimoto will not appreciate tardiness."

"He would not. But there is more to your eagerness than punctuality." The old man's eyes carried knowing amusement. "You are invested now. The house has become important to you beyond mere utility."

"Perhaps." Sheldon accepted the tea, wrapping his hands around the warm cup. "Watching the floor revealed and repaired, seeing the damage addressed, knowing that today it will be covered and protected—there is satisfaction in the process."

"There is. Creation and restoration engage something fundamental in the human spirit. We are builders by nature, makers and fixers. The work satisfies needs that go deeper than the practical."

Tenchi appeared in the doorway, rubbing sleep from his eyes. He had clearly woken earlier than usual, drawn by the knowledge of what the day would bring.

"Are you leaving already?"

"Soon. Hashimoto will begin installation at eight o'clock."

"I wish I could watch." The boy's disappointment was evident but controlled—he had learned that some desires could not be immediately satisfied. "Will it be done when I get home from school?"

"Hashimoto believes so. The installation should be complete by late afternoon."

"Promise you'll wait for me before you do anything else? I want to see it together."

"I promise. We will view the completed room together."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this compromise. He settled at the table, accepting his own breakfast with sleepy contentment.

---

The walk to the house was familiar now, the path etched in memory and muscle. The village was waking—smoke rising from kitchens, early workers heading to fields or shops, the rhythms of rural life beginning their daily cycle.

Several people acknowledged Sheldon as he passed—nods, brief greetings, the recognition that had developed over weeks of presence. He was no longer a stranger, no longer an oddity to be examined from a distance. He was becoming part of the village's fabric, woven into its daily patterns.

Hashimoto's truck was already present when Sheldon arrived, parked in the same spot as the previous day. The tatami maker was unloading materials, his movements efficient and purposeful.

"You are early again," Hashimoto observed. "Good. There is preparation work before we begin."

"What kind of preparation?"

"The floor must be inspected after the night's settling. The sealant must be checked for proper curing. Any irregularities must be addressed before we lay the first mat." He handed Sheldon a stack of protective cloths. "And these must be arranged to protect the mats during installation. Fresh rush marks easily—fingerprints, scuffs, any contact with dirty hands will show on the surface."

They entered the house together, the interior transformed since the previous day's departure. The floor gleamed faintly in the morning light, the sealant having cured to a subtle sheen on the new boards. The chemical smell had faded, replaced by the clean scent of fresh wood.

"The sealant has set properly," Hashimoto pronounced, kneeling to examine the repaired sections. "The wood has not shifted overnight. We may proceed."

He ran his hand across the floor's surface, feeling for irregularities with expert fingers. The inspection was thorough, systematic—every board checked, every seam examined, every potential problem area assessed.

"Satisfactory. The foundation is ready." He rose and began arranging the protective cloths around the room's perimeter. "Now we prepare for the mats themselves."

---

The preparation was meticulous.

Hashimoto explained each step as he worked, transforming the instruction into a continuous education. The cloths were positioned to create clean pathways for carrying mats. The new tatami were unwrapped one by one, their protective paper removed with care that bordered on reverence.

"Each mat is numbered according to the layout pattern," he said, indicating the small marks on the mat edges. "The numbers correspond to positions in the room. We install in sequence, not randomly—the pattern matters."

"What pattern are you using?"

"The traditional *shūgi-jiki* pattern—auspicious arrangement. The mats are laid so that their corners never form a cross, which is considered unlucky. Instead, they create T-junctions, with the edges meeting in offset patterns." He sketched the layout in the air with his hands. "This room requires six mats. The central mats run east-west, the peripheral mats north-south. The grain of each mat aligns with its neighbors in prescribed relationship."

"The grain has a direction?"

"The weave does, yes. Rush is woven onto the mat's surface in parallel lines. These lines have a direction—they catch light differently depending on the angle of viewing. Properly oriented mats create a subtle visual rhythm, a pattern of light and shadow that pleases the eye without demanding attention."

He positioned the first mat near its destination, not yet laying it but preparing for installation. "Watch. I will demonstrate the placement of the first mat, then you will assist with the remainder."

---

The first mat's installation was a lesson in precision.

Hashimoto positioned himself at one end, his hands gripping the mat's edges with practiced certainty. He lifted it slightly—just enough to clear the floor—and walked it toward its designated position with measured steps.

"The mat must be lowered precisely. Once it contacts the floor, adjusting becomes difficult—the weight settles, the edges compress, the fit tightens. We aim for correct placement on the first attempt." He paused, holding the mat suspended. "Watch my feet. I move in alignment with the room's axis, never at an angle. Angled approach creates rotational error."

Sheldon observed the careful footwork—each step parallel to the walls, the body remaining square to the direction of travel. The precision was almost ceremonial, ritual movements developed through generations of practice.

Hashimoto lowered the mat with controlled grace, the heavy panel settling into position with a soft whisper of contact. The fit was exact—edges aligned with the room's borders, surface level and smooth. The rush weave caught the morning light, its parallel lines creating subtle shadows that ran the mat's length.

"The first mat establishes the pattern. All others reference it." He knelt to examine the placement, checking alignment from multiple angles. His hands ran along the edges, feeling for gaps or overlaps. "This is correct. Now we proceed to the second."

"What would happen if it were incorrect?"

"The error would propagate. Each subsequent mat would be positioned relative to the first, so any deviation would compound through the installation. By the final mat, a small initial error might become a visible gap or an overlapping edge." He rose, brushing dust from his knees. "This is why we take such care with the first placement. Rushing the foundation ruins everything that follows."

Sheldon helped carry the next mat, his hands positioned where Hashimoto indicated—supporting the weight without touching the rush surface. The mat was surprisingly heavy, the compressed straw core dense and solid. His muscles protested slightly at the sustained effort, but he maintained his grip without complaint.

"Good. You carry properly—weight distributed, surface protected." Hashimoto guided the placement, calling adjustments in real time. "Slightly left. Down. No—back up. The alignment is off by a finger's width. Left again. Down. Good."

The second mat settled beside the first, their edges meeting in a precise seam. The rush surfaces aligned, the weave patterns flowing from one mat to the next as though they were a single piece.

"This is the satisfaction of good work," Hashimoto said quietly. "Two pieces, made separately, fitting together as though they were always meant to be one. The mathematics of traditional tatami allows this—each mat is built to standard dimensions, and rooms are designed to accommodate them. When everything follows the pattern, everything fits."

"What happens in rooms that don't follow standard dimensions?"

"Then the tatami maker must create custom pieces. Half-mats, narrow mats, mats with unusual proportions. The work becomes more difficult, the fitting more precise. This room, fortunately, follows tradition—the dimensions are appropriate for standard mats with minimal adjustment."

---

The installation continued through the morning.

Each mat required the same careful attention—positioning, alignment, lowering, inspection. Hashimoto's standards were exacting, his eye for imperfection seemingly absolute. The slightest deviation earned correction; only perfect placement received approval.

"The third mat is the critical one," he explained, as they prepared to position it. "It must relate correctly to both the first and second while also establishing the relationship to the fourth. A error here propagates through the entire room."

"How do you know when it's correct?"

"Experience, primarily. After hundreds of installations, the eye learns what right looks like. But there are also physical tests." He demonstrated, pressing on the mat's edges where they met neighboring mats. "The seams should compress equally. Unequal compression indicates misalignment."

Sheldon absorbed the instruction, watching Hashimoto's hands as much as listening to his words. The craftsman's movements carried knowledge that could not be fully articulated—muscle memory, intuitive adjustments, the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime's practice.

By mid-morning, four mats were installed. The room was half-transformed, bare boards giving way to fresh rush in a diagonal line across the floor. The contrast was striking—the warm gold of new tatami against the darker tones of exposed wood.

"We pause here," Hashimoto announced. "Rest, water, assessment of progress."

They stepped outside, the fresh air welcome after the enclosed work. The morning had warmed, the sun now well above the horizon, the village fully awake and active. A neighbor passed on the road, nodded greeting, continued on her way. The normalcy of village life surrounded them—the sounds of distant activity, the smell of cooking fires, the rhythm of an ordinary day.

"You are learning well," Hashimoto said, accepting water from the container Sheldon had brought. "Your movements have improved since yesterday. You work with the materials now, not merely against them."

"I had good instruction."

"Instruction matters, but so does receptivity. Some students fight the teaching—they wish to impose their own methods, to shortcut the traditions. You accept what is offered and build upon it." He drank deeply, his throat moving as he swallowed. "This is how craft is preserved. One generation teaches; the next learns and eventually teaches in turn."

"I am older than most students."

"Age matters less than attitude. I have taught young men who could not learn and old men who absorbed knowledge like dry earth absorbs rain." Hashimoto set down his water container. "You are among the latter. Be grateful for this capacity—it is a gift."

"Did you learn easily when you were young?"

Hashimoto considered the question, his weathered face thoughtful. "Not at first. I was impatient, eager to complete work rather than perfect it. My father was strict—he would not allow me to progress until each skill was mastered. We had many arguments." A slight smile at the memory. "Eventually I understood that his strictness was kindness. The skills he forced me to learn properly have served me throughout my career."

"He was a good teacher."

"He was a demanding teacher. Good came later, when I understood why the demands existed." Hashimoto stretched, working stiffness from his shoulders. "Now I try to be demanding in the same way. Not because I enjoy being difficult, but because proper teaching requires proper standards."

"Tanaka-san has a similar philosophy."

"All true craftsmen do. The methods differ, but the principle remains constant. Quality requires discipline. Discipline requires patience. Patience requires understanding of why things must be done a certain way." He nodded toward the house. "Shall we continue? The remaining mats await."

---

The remaining mats were installed after the break.

The fifth mat completed the main floor area, its placement particularly precise given its position between four neighboring mats. Hashimoto insisted on multiple adjustments, refusing to accept the first placement despite it appearing correct to Sheldon's eye.

"You see it as level. I see it as two millimeters high on the eastern edge." He pressed the mat down, held it, released. "The compression must be consistent. Inconsistency creates wear patterns, causes premature aging."

The adjustment made, he finally nodded approval. "Now the sixth—the final mat."

The sixth mat was smaller than the others, a half-size piece that filled the remaining space near the entrance. Its installation was technically simpler but symbolically significant—the last piece of the transformation.

"You will place this one," Hashimoto said. "I will supervise, but the work is yours."

Sheldon positioned himself as he had watched Hashimoto do dozens of times. He gripped the mat's edges, lifted it clear of the floor, and walked it toward its destination with careful steps.

"Good. Lower slowly—maintain level as you descend."

The mat settled into place with the same whispered contact he had observed all morning. The fit was good—edges aligned, surface level, pattern matching its neighbors.

Hashimoto knelt to inspect, his examination thorough and silent. The moment stretched, Sheldon uncertain whether correction would be demanded.

"Acceptable," Hashimoto pronounced finally. "Not perfect—there is a slight irregularity in the northwestern corner—but acceptable for a first placement. The irregularity is minor enough that I will leave it rather than require repositioning."

"Thank you."

"Do not thank me. I am not grading on generosity. The placement was genuinely acceptable." He rose, surveying the completed floor. "The room is finished."

---

The transformation was remarkable.

Where bare boards had been, fresh tatami now stretched across the entire floor. The rush surfaces caught the light from the windows, their weave patterns creating subtle variations in shade and texture. The room smelled of grass and clean things—the distinctive scent of new tatami that would fade gradually over months of use.

Sheldon stood in the doorway, taking in the change. The room felt different—softer, warmer, more alive. The tatami absorbed sound, muffled footsteps, created an atmosphere of quietude that the bare boards had lacked.

"This is what I do," Hashimoto said quietly, standing beside him. "I change spaces. I take rooms that are cold and hard and I make them soft and welcoming. It is simple work, in some ways—laying mats according to ancient patterns—but the results are significant."

"The results are beautiful."

"Beauty is incidental. Function is primary." But his voice carried satisfaction that belied the modest words. "The mats will serve this room for years, perhaps decades. They will absorb the activities of whoever uses this space—their footsteps, their conversations, their daily lives. Eventually they will need replacement, and someone like me will come again, remove the worn mats, and lay fresh ones. The cycle continues."

"How long will these mats last?"

"With proper care, twenty to thirty years. Some last longer; some fail sooner. It depends on use, on maintenance, on the quality of the air and light." He began gathering his tools, the work complete. "You should air the room regularly—open the windows, let the breezes pass through. Tatami needs to breathe, just like people do."

"I will remember."

"And clean them properly—a dry broom, following the grain of the weave. Never wet cleaning, which traps moisture in the straw core. Never harsh chemicals, which damage the rush surface." He loaded his tools into their carrying bag. "I will provide written instructions. The care is not difficult, but it must be consistent."

---

Lunch was eaten in the completed room.

Hashimoto had brought rice balls again, enough for two, and they sat on the fresh tatami—the first meal in the renewed space. The mats were slightly yielding under their weight, the compressed straw providing cushioning that the wooden floor had lacked.

The simple act of sitting felt ceremonial—the first use of a space prepared for use. Sheldon was aware of the significance, the symbolic weight of occupying what had so recently been empty.

"The Tsukino family would have eaten meals here," Hashimoto said, looking around the room. "Generations of them, sitting where we sit now. Their tatami is gone, replaced by these new mats, but the function continues."

"Continuity of purpose."

"Yes. The materials change; the use persists. This is what houses are—containers for human activity that outlast individual lives." He ate methodically, his movements precise even in rest. "Your repair shop will continue this tradition. Different work than furniture-making, but work nonetheless. The house will be active again."

"When do you think it will be ready for that purpose?"

"That depends on what remains to be done. The floor is now complete—this room is habitable. But there are other rooms, other repairs needed." Hashimoto considered, his gaze traveling the walls. "If you work steadily, maintaining the pace you have shown, perhaps two to three months before the entire house is functional. Less if you hire additional craftsmen; more if you work alone."

"I have been considering the sequence. The main room—this room—was priority. Next, perhaps the kitchen area, then the workshop space."

"A reasonable sequence. The kitchen requires specialized work—plumbing, ventilation, fire safety. You will need additional expertise."

"Ishikawa-san mentioned a letter of introduction to an electrician. There is much that requires professional attention."

"There is. But the foundation is sound, the floor is new, the structure is stable. These are the elements that matter most. Everything else is refinement." Hashimoto finished his rice ball and brushed crumbs from his hands with careful attention. "I will prepare my invoice. The work has taken slightly longer than estimated—four days rather than three—but the price will reflect the actual labor, no more."

"I appreciate your fairness."

"Fairness is good business. Customers who feel cheated do not return; customers who feel respected recommend your services to others." He gathered the lunch containers, stacking them neatly. "You will need tatami in other rooms eventually. I hope you will remember my work when that time comes."

"I will remember. Your work has been excellent."

"The work has been adequate. Excellence would require perfection, which I do not claim." But his voice carried satisfaction that belied the modest words. "There are always improvements possible. A true craftsman sees the flaws that others miss."

"What flaws do you see?"

Hashimoto smiled slightly—the most open expression Sheldon had seen from him. "That would require another hour of explanation. The mats are good, the installation is proper, but nothing is ever truly perfect. We approach perfection; we do not achieve it." He rose to his feet. "That is why the work never ends. There is always another step toward the ideal."

---

The afternoon brought documentation and departure.

Hashimoto provided written care instructions as promised—a single page of careful handwriting that detailed maintenance procedures, warning signs, and proper cleaning techniques. He also provided his invoice, the figures clear and itemized.

"The materials cost is separate from the labor cost. The floor repair materials are included, as agreed. The total is as we discussed, plus a small addition for the extra day's work." He handed over the paper. "Payment at your convenience, though I prefer within two weeks."

Sheldon reviewed the figures, found them reasonable, and nodded acceptance. "I will arrange payment promptly. The work has been excellent."

"The work has been adequate. Excellence would require perfection, which I do not claim." But Hashimoto's modesty was formal rather than genuine—he knew the quality of what he had produced. "There is one more matter."

He reached into his tool bag and produced a small bundle wrapped in cloth. "A gift. Not traditional, but appropriate."

Sheldon unwrapped the bundle to find a short section of rush—a sample of the material that now covered the floor. The weave was perfect, the fibers pristine, a miniature example of the craft that filled the room.

"For your records, or simply as a reminder. The rush came from the same batch as your mats. It will age at the same rate, change color in the same way. By observing it, you can track the condition of your floor without formal inspection."

"This is thoughtful. Thank you."

"Practical, not thoughtful. A craftsman who provides maintenance guidance protects his reputation. If your mats fail prematurely due to improper care, some would blame me rather than the care." But his eyes crinkled slightly with suppressed warmth. "You are welcome nonetheless."

They shook hands—a formal conclusion to a professional relationship that had developed elements of respect beyond mere commerce. Hashimoto departed with the same efficient directness that had characterized all his interactions, his truck rumbling to life and disappearing down the village road.

Sheldon remained in the doorway, looking at the completed room. The afternoon light fell across the tatami in long golden bars, the rush surfaces glowing with captured warmth. The house felt different now—more complete, more ready to fulfill its purpose.

---

Tenchi arrived precisely after school, his timing impeccable.

The boy appeared at the yard's edge, school bag forgotten in his haste, his eyes wide with anticipation. He paused at the threshold, taking in the transformation with visible wonder. His mouth opened, closed, opened again—words temporarily defeated by the magnitude of change.

"It's so different," he breathed finally. "It's like a real room now."

"It is a real room now. The floor is complete."

Tenchi stepped inside, his feet testing the tatami with experimental pressure. Each step was careful, exploratory, as though he were walking on something precious. "It's soft! Not hard like before."

"The mats have a compressed straw core. They provide cushioning that bare boards cannot."

"And it smells nice. Like... like grass, kind of. But different." He inhaled deeply, trying to identify the unfamiliar scent. "Kind of sweet? And clean?"

"Fresh rush. The smell will fade over time, but for now it fills the space."

Tenchi walked the room slowly, examining every detail with the thoroughness of a dedicated inspector. He touched the mats where they met, feeling the seams. He pressed his palm flat against the surface, watching how it yielded slightly under pressure. He knelt to examine the weave pattern, tracing the parallel lines with one finger.

"The lines all go the same way," he observed. "Like in drawing class when we practice straight lines."

"That is the direction of the weave. The rush is woven onto the mat's surface in consistent patterns."

"It's pretty. Not like a picture kind of pretty, but like... organized pretty. Everything in its place."

"The Japanese word might be *seiri*—orderliness that pleases the eye."

"Seiri," Tenchi repeated, testing the word. "I like that. Seiri."

He continued his circuit of the room, pausing at each wall, each corner, each transition between mats. His observations were a mixture of childish wonder and genuine insight—he noticed things that Sheldon had not thought to mention, asked questions that revealed the depth of his engagement.

"Why do the mats meet in T-shapes instead of crosses?"

"Tradition. The T-pattern is considered auspicious—bringing good fortune to those who use the space."

"Does it really work?"

"That depends on whether you believe such things can work. At minimum, it creates a pleasing visual pattern."

"I think I believe it," Tenchi decided. "Or at least, I want to believe it. This room feels happy. Maybe that's the T-shapes working."

He completed his inspection and came to stand beside Sheldon at the room's center. The afternoon light fell through the windows at a low angle, casting long golden bars across the tatami. Dust motes drifted in the light, the ordinary magic of illumination made visible.

"Hashimoto-san did this?"

"With my assistance. I helped carry and position the mats, but the skill was his."

"It's beautiful." The word came out with simple sincerity. "The house is really becoming something now."

"It is. This room is finished—functional and complete. Other rooms will follow, in time."

Tenchi sat down in the center of the floor, cross-legged, as though testing the space for occupation. The mats accepted his weight, yielding slightly, providing the support that functional furniture should provide.

"We could have a picnic here. Or play games. Or just sit and talk."

"All of those things, eventually. The room is now ready for use."

"When will you start fixing the other rooms?"

"Soon. There is planning to do first—determining what each space requires, what materials and expertise will be needed. But the work will continue."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied. He lay back on the tatami, staring up at the ceiling, his small body relaxed and comfortable. The position was trusting, vulnerable—the way a child lies when they feel completely safe.

"The ceiling is old," he observed. "Older than the floor now."

"It is. The ceiling was not damaged, so it did not require replacement. The contrast will fade over time as the new mats age."

"So someday the ceiling and floor will match again?"

"In a manner of speaking. They will both show age, though different amounts. But yes—the newness of the floor will eventually soften, and the contrast will diminish."

"That's kind of nice. Growing old together."

"It is. Things that share space tend to develop shared characteristics over time."

"Like families."

"Like families."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied. He lay back on the tatami, staring up at the ceiling, his small body relaxed and comfortable.

"I like it here," he said. "Not just this room—this whole place. It feels like something good is happening."

"Something good is happening. The house is being restored. That is a good thing."

"Not just the house." He turned his head to look at Sheldon. "Everything. You being here. The kitten. The people who help. It all feels like... like things are getting better."

"They are getting better. Day by day, step by step."

"Like you always say." Tenchi smiled, the expression uncomplicated and bright. "I like that. Knowing that things get better if you just keep working on them."

---

They returned to the shrine together, the late afternoon sun warm on their backs.

Tenchi's hand found Sheldon's as they walked, the gesture automatic now, a natural expression of the connection between them. His chatter filled the journey—questions about the installation process, observations about the finished room, plans for what might happen next.

"Could we have dinner there someday? In the new room?"

"Perhaps. Once the kitchen is also functional, we could prepare a meal and eat it in the space."

"That would be special. Like a celebration."

"It would be a celebration. A marking of completion, of progress."

"Can we invite people? Like Tanaka-san, and the Nakamura family?"

"When the time is right, we could invite those who helped with the restoration. It would be appropriate to share the result with those who contributed."

Tenchi considered this, his expression thoughtful. "That's a lot of people. Hashimoto-san, and Tanaka-san, and the people who sold you things, and everyone who helped."

"Many people have contributed. The restoration is not a solitary effort."

"That's nice though. Having lots of people help. It means the house belongs to everyone, kind of. Not just you."

The observation was insightful, touching on something Sheldon had been contemplating. The house was becoming a community project, not merely a personal one. The investment of the village's craftsmen and suppliers created connections that would persist beyond the work itself.

"In a sense, yes. The house carries the contributions of many hands."

"Like the shrine," Tenchi said. "Grandfather says the shrine belongs to everyone in the village, even though our family takes care of it. Because everyone uses it and helps with it."

"The principle is similar. Shared investment creates shared ownership."

"So when people come to the repair shop, they'll be coming to everyone's place? Not just yours?"

"That is a thoughtful way to consider it. The shop will serve the community, using skills and materials that the community provided. The relationship is reciprocal—the village helped create the shop, and the shop will help maintain the village."

They walked in comfortable silence for a while, the path winding through familiar territory. The shrine came into view, its familiar gates and paths welcoming their return. Hikaru would be waiting, Katsuhito would want to hear about the completion, the evening rhythms would resume.

"I'm going to tell Grandfather everything," Tenchi declared. "About the mats, and how they fit together, and the special pattern. I want him to understand how amazing it is."

"He will appreciate the telling."

"And I'll practice explaining things. Like you do. With all the details in the right order."

"That is a valuable skill. Clear explanation helps others understand what you have experienced."

"Like being a teacher."

"Teaching is a form of sharing. When you explain what you learned, you help others learn too."

Tenchi nodded, his expression determined. "I want to be good at sharing. So people can understand the things I think are important."

"You are already good at it. Your enthusiasm communicates as much as your words."

---

Dinner was indeed a recounting.

Tenchi provided most of the narrative, his enthusiasm compensating for any gaps in technical accuracy. He described the mats' arrival, their installation, the precision of Hashimoto's work, the transformation of the space. His hands gestured as he spoke, illustrating points that words alone could not convey.

"And the mats fit together perfectly," he said, using his fingers to demonstrate how the edges met. "Like this, see? No gaps at all. Hashimoto-san measured everything with his hands, and he could tell if something was even a tiny bit wrong."

"Craftsmen develop sensitivity to small variations," Katsuhito observed. "Years of practice train the senses to perceive what others cannot."

"He said he could feel a two-millimeter difference. That's smaller than my fingernail!"

"The body learns what the mind cannot grasp. This is true of many skills—archery, calligraphy, cooking. The hands develop knowledge of their own."

Tenchi considered this, his expression thoughtful. "Is that why you practice every morning? With the bow?"

"In part. The practice maintains skills that might otherwise fade. But it also develops new sensitivity, new understanding. I am still learning, after many decades."

"Will you ever be done learning?"

"I hope not. A life without learning is a life without growth. The moment we stop reaching for improvement is the moment we begin to decline."

The meal continued with comfortable conversation, the day's work providing material for extended discussion. Katsuhito listened with patient attention, asking occasional questions that drew out additional details. His interest was genuine, his appreciation for the work evident in his responses.

"The shūgi-jiki pattern is traditional," he confirmed, when Tenchi mentioned the auspicious arrangement. "It has been used for centuries, developed from principles of balance and harmony. The avoidance of cross-corners is believed to prevent the accumulation of negative energy."

"Is that true?" Tenchi asked. "Can patterns really affect energy?"

"That depends on how one defines energy and truth. The patterns certainly affect perception—a well-laid floor creates visual harmony that pleases the eye and calms the mind. Whether this represents an actual metaphysical effect or merely a psychological one is a question for philosophers."

"Hashimoto-san seemed to believe it mattered," Sheldon observed. "He was insistent on correct pattern, beyond mere aesthetic preference."

"Craftsmen often develop beliefs that go beyond strict rationality. When you spend your life working with materials, you begin to perceive qualities that others cannot see." Katsuhito served additional rice to Tenchi, who had eaten enthusiastically. "The shrine priests have similar experiences. Years of ritual practice create sensitivities that seem mystical to outsiders but feel natural to those who possess them."

"Like muscle memory?"

"Similar. The body learns; the mind follows. Eventually, the knowledge becomes part of who you are, inseparable from conscious thought."

Tenchi reached for another serving of vegetables, his appetite robust after the day's excitement. "Tsukino-san said the room feels happy now. Because of the T-patterns being auspicious."

Katsuhito glanced at Sheldon with quiet amusement. "And does it feel happy to you?"

"It feels... complete. Whether that translates to happiness in a metaphysical sense, I cannot say. But the room certainly feels different from how it felt before."

"Completion has its own energy. A space that has been restored carries the satisfaction of the work, the attention of those who performed it. Perhaps that is what we sense when we enter finished spaces—not magic, but accumulated intention."

The meal continued with comfortable conversation, the day's work providing material for extended discussion. By the time dinner was complete, Tenchi was yawning, his energy depleted by the day's excitement.

"Bedtime soon," Katsuhito observed. "Tomorrow is another school day."

"But I want to hear more about the house..."

"The house will be there tomorrow, and the day after. Its story is not ending—merely pausing for rest."

---

Bedtime brought the day to its natural conclusion.

Tenchi submitted to the routine with minimal resistance, his tiredness overcoming his desire to continue talking. He settled into his futon with Usagi-chan, his eyes already heavy.

"The room is so beautiful," he murmured, half-asleep. "I can't wait to see it again."

"You will see it again. Many times."

"And someday we'll have dinner there. With everyone who helped."

"Someday we will."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Tenchi smiled, the expression fading as sleep claimed him. His breathing slowed, his features relaxed, the cares of consciousness releasing their hold.

Sheldon sat for a moment, watching the peaceful face. The day's work had been satisfying—the completion of a significant milestone, the transformation of a space from potential to reality. But the greater satisfaction lay in this: the connection with a child who found joy in the process, who saw the restoration as something shared and meaningful.

He rose quietly and left the room.

---

On the engawa, the stars were emerging.

Twenty-four days. The first room complete, functional and beautiful. Fresh tatami lay where bare boards had been, the work of skilled hands transforming space into place. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new tasks, but tonight was for appreciation.

Katsuhito joined him after a few minutes, settling into the adjacent space with the comfortable ease of routine.

"The floor is truly finished?" he asked.

"Hashimoto approved the installation. The room is ready for use."

"Then you have achieved something significant. The first concrete result of your restoration efforts."

"It feels significant. More than I expected, perhaps."

"Completion often does. We underestimate the emotional weight of finishing what we started." Katsuhito's voice was reflective. "In shrine practice, we speak of the importance of closing circles—beginning what must be begun, continuing what must be continued, completing what must be completed. Each stage has its own character, its own demands."

"Beginning felt like uncertainty. Continuing felt like labor. Completing feels like..."

"Relief? Satisfaction? Pride?"

"All of those. And something else—eagerness to begin the next phase."

Katsuhito chuckled softly. "That is the nature of builders. Completion is not an ending but a transition. One circle closes; another opens. The work continues."

"The work continues," Sheldon agreed.

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the stars multiply as the sky darkened. The night was peaceful, the shrine quiet, the world holding its breath in the space between days.

Twenty-four days down. The building continued.

⁂

## Day 25

---

## Thursday, April 27, 1989

---

The morning arrived quietly, without the anticipation that had marked the previous days.

Sheldon woke at his usual time, the absence of urgent purpose creating a different quality of consciousness. The tatami work was complete. There was no craftsman to meet, no installation to supervise, no transformation to witness. The day stretched ahead with ordinary possibility rather than scheduled significance.

The warmth hummed in his chest, a steady presence rather than an urgent one. The milestone had been achieved; now came the work of determining what came next.

He rose and dressed, moving through the familiar routine with unhurried attention. The shrine was peaceful in the early light, the household still sleeping, the world holding the quiet that preceded activity.

---

Breakfast was leisurely, the first such meal in nearly a week.

"You did not rise before dawn," Katsuhito observed, pouring tea with his usual deliberation. "The absence of external schedule has affected your internal one."

"I noticed. The body apparently calibrates to expected demands. Without Hashimoto-san waiting, it saw no reason for early waking."

"The body is wiser than we credit. It conserves energy when possible, expends it when necessary." The old man settled into his place at the table. "What are your plans for today?"

"Assessment, I think. The main room is complete, but there is much work remaining. I should evaluate the other spaces, determine priorities, plan the sequence of restoration."

"A sensible approach. The momentum of completion can be channeled into preparation for what comes next."

Tenchi appeared, drawn by the sounds of breakfast, his hair still tousled from sleep. Hikaru followed at his heels, the kitten having developed the habit of accompanying the boy from bedroom to kitchen each morning.

"Good morning." Tenchi settled at the table, yawning. "Is Hashimoto-san coming today?"

"No. His work is finished. Today is for planning what happens next."

"Oh." The boy considered this, his expression shifting from sleepy to thoughtful. "So the busy part is over?"

"The busy part of the tatami work is over. But there will be more busy parts—other rooms require attention, other craftsmen will be needed. The restoration continues."

"But not today?"

"Today is quieter. Assessment and planning rather than physical labor."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this explanation. He accepted his breakfast and began eating with the focused attention of a growing child.

---

The morning was spent at the house.

Sheldon walked through each room systematically, examining conditions with fresh eyes. The contrast with the completed main room was striking—where that space now glowed with fresh tatami and renewed purpose, the others remained in various states of neglect.

He began with the room adjacent to the main space, what appeared to have been a secondary living area. The floor here was also tatami, though in far worse condition than the mats Hashimoto had replaced. Several showed visible damage—tears, stains, compression that indicated water damage. The walls were sound but dirty, the shoji screens torn and weathered.

"This room requires similar treatment to the main space," Sheldon noted aloud, establishing the habit of verbal documentation. "Tatami replacement, screen repair, general cleaning. Lower priority than functional spaces but eventually necessary."

The kitchen was perhaps the most challenging. The space showed evidence of decades of use followed by years of abandonment. The cooking area was primitive by modern standards—a traditional kamado stove that would need either restoration or replacement. The clay body was intact, as Tanaka would later confirm, but the interior showed heavy soot buildup and the exterior was cracked in places.

The water supply was questionable. A hand pump stood in one corner, its mechanism stiff with disuse. Whether it still drew water from the well, and whether that water was still safe, would require investigation. The drainage was equally uncertain—a simple channel led toward the exterior, but its condition and endpoint were unknown.

He made notes as he moved through the space, documenting conditions and concerns. The walls showed water staining in places, suggesting leaks that would need to be traced and repaired. The discoloration followed patterns that indicated both roof leaks and splash damage from cooking. The floor was wooden rather than tatami, which simplified some considerations but raised others—the boards would need assessment similar to what Hashimoto had performed in the main room.

A small window provided inadequate light, and the ventilation consisted only of the door and this single opening. For serious cooking, the space would need improvement—a proper vent, perhaps additional windows, certainly better airflow to prevent smoke accumulation.

"Kitchen is a major project," Sheldon concluded. "Will require specialized expertise—plumbing for reliable water, ventilation for safety, possibly electrical for modern convenience. Not the immediate priority."

The storage areas were cluttered with debris from the house's various occupants. Broken furniture, deteriorating textiles, abandoned household goods accumulated over years of transitions. He picked through some of the items carefully, assessing what might be salvageable.

A chest in one corner caught his attention. The wood was dark with age, the hardware tarnished but intact. The joinery was fine—dovetails that fit precisely, proportions that pleased the eye. This might be Tsukino family work, an example of the furniture-making craft that had once distinguished this household.

"Worth preserving," he decided. "Restoration possible. Could serve as storage, or simply as a reminder of the house's history."

Other items were less promising. Textiles had mildewed beyond recovery. Wooden utensils had cracked from moisture cycles. Ceramic pieces were chipped or broken, their utility ended. Most would require disposal, though some fragments might have value as historical curiosity.

The potential workshop space—the room he envisioned for repair work—had better bones. The structure was sound, the floor reasonably level, the walls intact. The space was larger than he had initially appreciated, perhaps twenty tatami mats in area if calculated by traditional measure. Adequate for a workbench, tool storage, customer reception, and material organization.

"This is the priority," Sheldon affirmed. "Clean, prepare, equip. Then begin the work that will support everything else."

He was still assessing when Tanaka arrived.

Sheldon turned to find Tanaka standing in the doorway, the old man having approached without sound. The blacksmith carried a cloth-wrapped bundle, his expression curious.

"I did not hear you arrive."

"You were absorbed in your examination. A good quality in a craftsman—concentration that excludes distraction." Tanaka stepped inside, surveying the space. "How does the assessment proceed?"

"The kitchen is the most significant challenge. The workshop space is more straightforward. The storage areas require clearing before evaluation is possible."

"A reasonable summary." Tanaka moved through the room, his own assessment evident in the way his eyes tracked details. "The roof appears sound from inside—no light penetration, no water staining on the ceiling."

"I had not thought to check for light penetration."

"An old method. In a neglected building, holes in the roof show as bright spots when viewed from inside. The darkness here suggests integrity." He gestured toward the walls. "The construction is traditional—post and beam with infill panels. The posts bear the weight; the panels provide enclosure. If the posts are sound, the structure is stable."

"How does one assess post soundness?"

"Percussion, primarily. Tap the wood and listen. Solid wood rings; damaged wood thuds." Tanaka demonstrated, striking one of the corner posts with his knuckle. The sound was clear, resonant. "This one is healthy."

He moved to another post, repeated the test. The sound was similar—solid, ringing, confident.

"The main posts appear good. The structure should serve you well."

"I am grateful for the assessment. My knowledge of construction is limited."

"All knowledge is limited. The skill lies in knowing whose expertise to borrow." Tanaka set down his bundle on a cleared surface. "I brought the next set of tools for restoration. These are more specialized than the previous batch—precision instruments that require delicate attention."

---

The bundle contained measuring tools.

Tanaka unwrapped them with the reverence of a priest handling sacred objects—calipers, gauges, a small scale for weighing, instruments whose purposes were not immediately apparent.

"These belonged to Hideo's father," Tanaka explained. "Passed from master to apprentice across three generations. The precision they offer is difficult to match with modern manufacturing."

Sheldon examined a caliper, its brass surfaces worn smooth by decades of handling. The mechanism moved with fluid precision, the jaws opening and closing with barely perceptible resistance.

"The craftsmanship is exceptional."

"It is. These were made by a specialist in Tokyo, commissioned specifically for the family's use. The cost, at the time, was considerable." Tanaka's voice carried memory. "Hideo's grandfather was a demanding man. He believed that proper tools were essential to proper work, and he was willing to pay for quality."

"The philosophy has been consistent across generations."

"It has. The family understood that excellence required investment—in materials, in tools, in training. They did not cut corners, did not accept 'good enough' when better was achievable." He picked up one of the gauges, demonstrating its use. "This measures thickness to within a tenth of a millimeter. For fine metalwork, such precision is essential."

"I have not worked at that level of precision before."

"You will learn. The tools teach their use to those who attend properly." Tanaka began explaining each instrument—its purpose, its proper handling, its maintenance requirements. The instruction was thorough, patient, assuming no prior knowledge.

Sheldon absorbed the information, asking questions when details were unclear. The tools were beautiful in their precision, their function made elegant through generations of refinement.

"These will require practice before I can use them effectively," he admitted.

"All skills require practice. The tools will wait while you develop the ability to employ them properly." Tanaka rewrapped the instruments with care. "Keep them protected from moisture and dust. Oil the moving parts monthly. They will serve you for decades if maintained correctly."

"I will treat them with appropriate respect."

"I know you will. That is why I am entrusting them to you."

---

They walked the house together, Tanaka offering commentary that expanded Sheldon's understanding.

The old blacksmith saw things that Sheldon had missed—subtle signs of structural stress, evidence of past repairs, indications of how the building had been used over its history. His knowledge was encyclopedic, drawn from a lifetime of working with buildings and the materials that composed them.

"This wall was added later," Tanaka observed, running his hand along a partition. "The wood is different from the original construction—see how the grain differs? Someone divided this space, perhaps to create separate rooms for multiple occupants."

"Can it be removed?"

"Possibly. The partition is not load-bearing—it does not support the roof or upper structure. Removing it would restore the original space, if that serves your purposes."

"I had been planning around it. The possibility of removal changes the options."

"Always consider what can be changed as well as what exists. Buildings are more flexible than they appear, particularly traditional construction like this." Tanaka continued his circuit. "This beam has been repaired—see the joint? Someone spliced new wood onto the original, extending its length. The work is competent, perhaps fifty years old."

"How can you tell the age?"

"The color of the wood at the joint, the style of the splice, the tools marks left by the work. Construction techniques change over time; the evidence remains in the building." He smiled slightly. "Reading buildings is like reading books. The history is written in the materials, waiting to be interpreted."

They reached the kitchen, where Tanaka's assessment became more detailed.

"The kamado is repairable," he pronounced, examining the traditional stove. "The clay body is intact; only the surface layer requires attention. A specialist could restore it in a day's work."

"Do you know such a specialist?"

"I know someone who knows someone. The traditional crafts are interconnected; practitioners maintain networks of mutual assistance." He tested the stove's structure with careful pressure. "Alternatively, you could install a modern cooking arrangement. Less traditional, but more convenient."

"I have not decided. The kitchen's use depends on whether I will live here or merely work here."

"A decision that need not be made immediately. Prepare the space for flexibility; choose the specific arrangements when your intentions become clear."

---

Lunch was eaten at the shrine, the morning's work creating appetite.

Katsuhito had prepared a simple meal—rice, pickled vegetables, fish from the previous day. The food was nourishing without being elaborate, sustenance for continued effort. The kitchen was warm with the lingering heat from cooking, comfortable after the cooler air of the house.

"Tanaka-san visited the house," Sheldon reported, settling into his place at the table. "He brought additional tools and helped assess the building's condition."

"He mentioned he might. The old man takes interest in projects that engage his expertise." Katsuhito served the rice with practiced movements, the portion sizes calibrated by familiarity. "What did you learn?"

"The structure is sound. The kitchen requires the most work. The workshop space is relatively straightforward. Some of the interior walls are later additions that could be removed if desired."

"A thorough assessment, then."

"More thorough than I could have managed alone. Tanaka-san sees details that I would have missed. He taught me to listen to the posts—percussion testing to assess soundness."

"An old technique. My father used similar methods when maintaining the shrine buildings." Katsuhito took his own seat, his movements deliberate and unhurried. "The knowledge passes between practitioners, each generation learning from the previous."

"I found a chest in the storage area that may be Tsukino family work. The joinery is exceptional—dovetails that fit precisely, proportions that please the eye."

"That would be worth preserving. The Tsukino craftsmen were known for such pieces. If it survived the house's neglect, it has proven its quality."

Sheldon ate quietly for a moment, considering his next words. "The question becomes: what is the priority?"

"The workshop space, I think. It requires less intervention than the kitchen and serves my immediate purpose. Once it is functional, I can begin the repair work that will eventually support the household."

"A practical sequence. Establish income before investing in comfort."

"Exactly. The main room provides adequate living space for now. The workshop enables earning. The kitchen and other refinements can follow when resources allow."

"You are thinking like a villager now," Katsuhito observed, a note of approval in his voice. "Prioritizing sustainability over immediate gratification. Many newcomers fail to understand this principle—they want everything at once and end up achieving nothing."

"My previous life taught me the dangers of unsustainable ambition. I pursued academic achievements at the expense of everything else. The results were impressive by certain measures but hollow by others."

"And now?"

"Now I am building something different. Slower, more modest, but more connected. The house serves not just my needs but the community's. The skills I am learning have practical application for others. The relationships I am developing create mutual support rather than competitive advantage."

"This is the village way. Individual success is measured not by isolation from others but by integration with them." Katsuhito finished his fish, setting aside the bones with careful attention. "A prosperous farmer is one who helps his neighbors prosper. A successful craftsman is one whose work improves the community's life."

Tenchi returned from school as they were finishing the meal, his energy high despite the day's studies. Hikaru greeted him at the door, the kitten's welcoming routine now firmly established—a small figure appearing at the threshold, tail raised in greeting, body pressing against Tenchi's ankles.

"How was school?" Sheldon asked.

"Good. We learned about rivers today—how they start small and get bigger as they flow." Tenchi set down his bag and knelt to pet Hikaru, his attention immediately captured by the kitten's affection. "Did you work on the house?"

"I assessed it. Planning what comes next now that the main room is finished."

"What comes next?"

"The workshop space. Where I will do repair work once it is ready."

Tenchi nodded, his attention divided between the conversation and the kitten. "Can I help with that too? Like I helped with the tatami watching?"

"When appropriate. Some work is too dangerous or technical for assistance, but observation is always welcome when conditions permit."

"Okay." He accepted this limitation without complaint, his trust in Sheldon's judgment apparently complete. "Hikaru caught a moth today. A real one, not a toy."

"Did he eat it?"

"No, he just played with it. And then it flew away and he looked confused." Tenchi giggled at the memory. "His face was so funny. Like he didn't understand where it went."

"Cats are learning hunters. Each experience teaches them more about how prey behaves."

"So next time he'll be better at moths?"

"Probably. Practice improves performance, in cats as in people."

"That's what Grandfather says about archery. That you get better by practicing, not by thinking about practicing."

"Your grandfather is wise. Knowledge that remains theoretical is incomplete. Only through practice does understanding become capability."

---

The afternoon was spent with Tanaka, continuing the tool restoration work.

They met at the blacksmith's shop, the familiar space now comfortable with repeated visits. The forge stood cold today—Tanaka had not planned metalworking, and the fire required hours to reach proper temperature. Instead, the workbench was arranged for sharpening, whetstones of various grades laid out in order of use.

The precision instruments Tanaka had delivered that morning remained at the house; the work today focused on older tools that required more basic attention.

"These are agricultural implements," Tanaka explained, laying out a collection of blades and handles. "Sickles, pruning knives, grafting tools. The village farmers bring them for sharpening and repair, but I have fallen behind."

Sheldon examined the collection. The tools showed heavy use—blades dulled by contact with wood and soil, handles worn smooth by countless hands, metal darkened by oxidation and accumulated residue. Each represented a farmer's livelihood, essential to the work that fed the community.

"You want me to help clear the backlog?"

"I want you to learn the work while helping clear the backlog. Each tool teaches something—the angle of the blade, the purpose of the curve, the relationship between form and function." He selected a sickle, its blade dull and nicked from use. "This is straightforward sharpening. Watch, then practice."

The instruction was methodical. Tanaka demonstrated the proper angle for the sharpening stone, the correct pressure, the rhythm of strokes that maintained edge geometry. His movements were fluid, practiced—the product of decades of repetition that had become as natural as breathing.

"The angle matters more than the pressure," he explained, the stone sliding along the blade with a soft rasping sound. "Too steep, and the edge becomes fragile. Too shallow, and it will not cut. The sickle requires approximately twenty degrees—enough strength to resist damage, enough sharpness to slice cleanly."

The sickle's curve required adjustment of technique as the work progressed—the inside edge demanded different approach than the outside. Tanaka rotated the tool as he worked, maintaining consistent contact between stone and metal despite the changing geometry.

"The curve serves a purpose," he continued. "It allows the farmer to gather stalks with one hand while cutting with the other. The motion is natural—a sweeping arc that catches and severs in a single movement. A straight blade would require different technique, different body positioning."

"Form follows function."

"Always. Every tool shape evolved to serve specific needs. When you understand the function, the form makes sense. When you understand the form, the proper technique becomes apparent."

He completed a series of strokes and paused to examine the edge. The metal gleamed where the stone had removed dull surface, the fresh edge catching light.

"Feel the burr forming," Tanaka directed, guiding Sheldon's finger carefully along the blade's back. A tiny curl of metal, almost imperceptible, lined the edge. "When you sense the metal curling at the edge, you have reached the proper thinness. Then reverse direction to remove the burr and polish the edge."

"How thin is too thin?"

"Experience teaches. A blade for cutting rice stalks can be thinner than one for cutting wood. The material being cut determines the edge requirements. These sickles work primarily with soft plant material—they can hold a fine edge. A chopping tool would require more substantial construction."

Sheldon took the sickle and the stone, positioning himself as Tanaka had demonstrated. His first strokes were tentative, uncertain.

"More confidence. The stone will not harm the blade unless you use it wrongly. Commit to the stroke." Tanaka adjusted Sheldon's grip. "And maintain the angle. Your wrist is wavering—keep it locked, move from the shoulder."

The correction helped. Sheldon found a rhythm, the stone sliding along the blade with increasing consistency. The work was meditative—repetitive motion that demanded attention without overwhelming thought. His mind could wander while his body maintained focus.

"Good. You are developing the feel." Tanaka observed the edge with expert eyes after several minutes. "A few more strokes on the outer curve, then test against paper."

The paper test was revealing. Tanaka provided a scrap of rice paper and demonstrated the technique—drawing the blade across the paper's surface at a shallow angle. A properly sharpened blade sliced through with minimal resistance, producing a clean cut. A poorly sharpened one caught and tore, leaving ragged edges.

Sheldon's first attempts showed room for improvement—the cut was clean in places, ragged in others. The edge had been sharpened unevenly, with some sections achieving proper geometry while others lagged.

"Consistency is the challenge," Tanaka observed. "Achieving sharpness in one spot is simple; maintaining it across the entire edge requires discipline. Continue practicing."

The next sickle went better. Sheldon paid closer attention to maintaining angle throughout the curve, checking his progress more frequently. The paper test showed improvement—more consistent cuts, fewer ragged sections.

"Better. Now try this." Tanaka handed him a pruning knife, its blade shorter and straighter than the sickle. "Different geometry, same principles. Find the proper angle and maintain it."

The pruning knife required different technique—the straight blade allowed longer strokes, but the smaller size demanded more precise control. Sheldon adapted, finding the rhythm particular to this tool.

The afternoon passed in this manner—instruction, practice, assessment, refinement. By the time the light began to fade, Sheldon had sharpened three sickles and two pruning knives. The quality improved with each tool, consistency emerging through repetition.

"You may keep these skills," Tanaka said, as they cleaned and organized the workspace. "Sharpening is fundamental—it applies to any blade, any cutting tool. A craftsman who cannot maintain edges is limited in what he can accomplish."

"I appreciate the teaching."

"The teaching benefits us both. I clear my backlog; you develop capability. The exchange is equitable." Tanaka smiled slightly, the expression rare enough to draw attention. "Though I admit I also enjoy the company. The shop is quiet when I work alone."

"Solitude has its place, but so does companionship."

"Wisely said. The balance between them varies with circumstance and temperament. I have spent too many years alone since Hideo passed; your presence reminds me of what I had been missing."

---

Dinner brought the household together again.

The meal was simple—the remains of lunch extended with additional vegetables and a soup that Katsuhito had prepared during the afternoon. The kitchen was warm and fragrant, the smells of cooking creating an atmosphere of comfort and security.

The conversation flowed easily, the day's events providing material for discussion.

"Tanaka-san taught me sharpening today," Sheldon reported. "Agricultural tools—sickles and pruning knives."

"Essential skills," Katsuhito acknowledged. "A sharp tool works efficiently; a dull one wastes effort and produces poor results."

"He said consistency is the challenge. Achieving sharpness in one spot is simple; maintaining it across the entire edge requires discipline."

"That principle applies broadly. Consistency of effort, of attention, of quality—these distinguish competent work from exceptional work." Katsuhito ladled soup into bowls, the steam rising in curling wisps. "The best practitioners in any field are those who maintain excellence not occasionally but reliably."

"He tested my work with paper. The blade should slice cleanly, without catching or tearing."

"The paper test is traditional. My father used it when sharpening tools for shrine maintenance. A properly sharpened blade leaves a clean edge; a poorly sharpened one leaves evidence of its inadequacy."

Tenchi listened to the conversation while eating, his attention shifting between the adults and his own thoughts. Hikaru had taken up his usual position near the boy, close enough to receive occasional attention but not so close as to interfere with the meal.

"Can knives get too sharp?" Tenchi asked. "Like, so sharp they're dangerous?"

"All sharp tools are dangerous," Sheldon replied. "The sharpness that enables efficient cutting also enables efficient injury. The solution is not to reduce sharpness but to increase care."

"So really good knives are also really dangerous?"

"In a sense. But the danger is manageable with proper technique and attention. A dull knife is often more dangerous than a sharp one—it requires more force, which leads to slipping, which leads to injury."

Tenchi considered this, his expression thoughtful. "That's kind of backwards. I would have thought sharper means more dangerous."

"Many things work differently than intuition suggests. This is why we test our assumptions rather than trusting them blindly."

"Like science?"

"Exactly like science. We observe, we hypothesize, we test. When our expectations prove wrong, we adjust our understanding."

"That's what we did with Hikaru," Tenchi realized. "I thought he would be scared of everything because he was so small. But he's actually brave. I had to adjust my understanding."

"Precisely. Your observation contradicted your hypothesis, so you revised your model."

Katsuhito nodded approvingly. "This is wisdom that serves in all areas of life. The willingness to be wrong, to learn, to revise one's beliefs in light of evidence—these are qualities worth cultivating."

"I try to be willing to be wrong," Tenchi said. "But sometimes it's hard. Like when I think I know something and then I find out I don't."

"That discomfort is natural. Our minds prefer certainty to uncertainty, knowledge to ignorance. But growth requires accepting that we are often wrong, that our understanding is always incomplete."

"Is anyone ever completely right?"

"About everything? No. About specific things? Sometimes. But even then, we should hold our certainty lightly, ready to revise if new evidence appears."

"What about things that can't be tested? Like whether houses have feelings?"

Katsuhito smiled at the question. "Some things resist testing. They fall outside the domain of scientific inquiry—matters of faith, of aesthetics, of personal meaning. For these, we must use different methods of understanding."

"What methods?"

"Contemplation. Tradition. Personal experience. The accumulated wisdom of generations." He paused to eat. "Science is powerful but limited. It tells us how things work; it does not tell us what things mean. For meaning, we must look elsewhere."

"Where?"

"Within ourselves. Within our communities. Within the stories and practices that have shaped human understanding across millennia." Katsuhito's voice was gentle. "The shrine exists to acknowledge truths that science does not address. This does not make them less true—merely different."

The meal continued with this extended discussion, the conversation ranging across topics that emerged naturally from the day's events. By the time dinner was complete, Tenchi was yawning, his energy depleted by both activity and contemplation.

---

Bedtime arrived with the usual routine.

Tenchi submitted to the process willingly, his energy depleted by the day's activities. He settled into his futon with Usagi-chan, Hikaru curling at his feet as had become customary. The room was peaceful, the lamplight casting gentle shadows on the walls.

"Today was different," he observed, as Sheldon adjusted the blankets. "Quieter than the house days."

"The intensity of the tatami work has passed. Today was for planning and practice rather than production."

"I liked the house days. They were exciting. But I also like the quiet days. They feel more... normal?"

"Both have their place. Life cannot be constant excitement—that would be exhausting. The quiet periods allow recovery and reflection."

"Like resting after exercise?"

"Similar. The body needs recovery from physical effort; the mind needs recovery from intense focus. Today provided both."

"But you still learned things. The sharpening."

"Yes. Quiet days can still be productive. The learning was different—skill development rather than visible construction. But it was learning nonetheless."

Tenchi yawned, his eyes growing heavy. Hikaru shifted slightly at his feet, the kitten's warmth a comfort in the cooling evening air.

"What will you do tomorrow?"

"Continue with the workshop space, I think. Assessment, planning, perhaps beginning the clearing work."

"Can I help with clearing? That sounds like something I could do."

"We will see. Some of what requires clearing may be too heavy or too fragile for assistance. But if appropriate tasks emerge, I will include you."

"Okay." Another yawn. "Tsukino-san? I like that you're planning things. It makes everything feel... organized. Like we know what's happening next."

"Structure provides comfort. When we understand the shape of what is coming, uncertainty decreases and security increases."

"Seiri," Tenchi murmured, referencing the word he had learned the day before. "Organized pretty."

"Yes. Seiri."

"I want my life to have seiri. Not like everything planned out forever, but... knowing what the next few days will bring. Knowing what I'm supposed to do."

"That is a reasonable desire. Complete certainty is impossible, but reasonable predictability is achievable. We maintain routines not because they are exciting but because they provide the stability that makes excitement bearable."

"Like having breakfast every morning. It's not exciting, but I wouldn't want to not have it."

"Exactly. The mundane supports the exceptional. Without the foundation of daily rhythms, we would have no secure base from which to venture into novelty."

Tenchi's eyes closed, sleep claiming him with its usual swiftness. His breathing slowed, his features relaxed, the cares of consciousness releasing their hold. Hikaru's breathing synchronized with the boy's, the two of them drifting into shared rest.

Sheldon sat for a moment, watching the peaceful faces—human and feline, united in the vulnerability of sleep. The connection he felt was profound and simple, the kind of love that required no analysis to be real.

He rose quietly and left the room.

---

On the engawa, the stars were emerging.

Twenty-five days. A day of assessment and practice, of learning and planning. The momentum of the tatami work had been channeled into preparation for the next phase. The restoration continued, shaped by the knowledge accumulated and the relationships developed.

Katsuhito joined him after a few minutes, the evening ritual now established.

"A productive day?" the old man asked.

"Productive in different ways than the previous days. Less visible accomplishment, more foundational preparation."

"Such days are often undervalued. The visible work attracts attention; the invisible preparation enables it." Katsuhito settled into his usual place. "Tanaka seemed pleased when I saw him this afternoon."

"We cleared part of his backlog. The farmers' tools needed attention."

"He has struggled to keep up since Hideo's death. The work accumulates faster than his aging body can address it." A pause. "Your assistance matters to him, beyond the practical benefit."

"He mentioned that. The companionship as much as the labor."

"Grief isolates. When we lose those closest to us, the world contracts. Human connection expands it again." Katsuhito's voice was soft. "You have expanded his world, just as he has contributed to yours."

"The exchange feels unequal. He gives me knowledge, tools, expertise accumulated over decades. I give him labor and presence."

"Do not undervalue presence. For someone who has been alone, the simple fact of another person's company can be precious beyond measure." The old man looked up at the stars. "I know this from my own experience. The years after my wife died were difficult, not because of practical challenges but because of the silence. Having someone to speak with, to share meals with, to mark the passage of days alongside—this is no small gift."

"You had Tenchi."

"I had Tenchi, yes. And he was—is—a joy. But a child's companionship is different from an adult's. There are things one cannot share with a child, conversations one cannot have." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "Your arrival changed that. Suddenly there was another adult in the household, someone capable of engaging with ideas and experiences at a different level."

"I had not considered the relationship from that perspective."

"Few do. Those who arrive in a situation see it from their own viewpoint—the challenges they face, the adjustments they must make. They rarely consider how their presence affects those already present."

"And how has my presence affected you?"

"Positively. The household has become livelier, the days more varied. Tenchi has someone to play with, to learn from, to model himself after—someone who complements my teaching rather than duplicating it. I have someone to discuss matters with, to share responsibilities with." He paused, his expression thoughtful. "And the future feels less uncertain. Before you arrived, I worried about what would happen to Tenchi if something happened to me. Now there is someone else who cares for him, who would continue that care if necessary."

"I would. Without question."

"I know. That knowledge is a gift—perhaps the greatest one you have given me." Katsuhito's voice carried quiet emotion. "I am old. My health is good, but I am realistic about what that means. The body declines; the years remaining are finite. When Tenchi was born, I worried about whether I would live long enough to see him grown. When Kiyone died, that worry became more urgent."

"You worried about leaving him alone."

"Yes. Nobuyuki is his father, but Nobuyuki's work takes him away for long periods. The shrine requires presence—someone must be here, must maintain the grounds, must fulfill the obligations to our ancestors. Tenchi was too young to manage alone, and Nobuyuki could not abandon his career." The old man shook his head slightly. "The burden of responsibility was mine alone. If I had died, the child would have been... adrift. Pulled between obligations, belonging nowhere completely."

"And now?"

"Now there is stability I could not have imagined. You have become part of this household in ways that transcend temporary arrangement. Tenchi loves you—genuinely, deeply, as a child loves a parent. If something happened to me tomorrow, he would grieve, but he would not be alone. He would have you."

Sheldon was silent for a moment, absorbing the weight of what Katsuhito was saying. The responsibility being articulated was profound—not the temporary care of a guest, but the permanent commitment of family.

"I understand what you are telling me."

"I hoped you would. Some things must be spoken clearly, even when they might already be understood." Katsuhito turned to face him directly, his eyes meeting Sheldon's with unusual intensity. "I am trusting you with the most precious thing in my world. Not for convenience, not for practical benefit, but because I believe you are worthy of that trust."

"I will honor it. For as long as I live."

"I know you will. That is why I trust you." The old man turned back to the stars. "Now. Let us speak of simpler things for a while, and enjoy this peaceful evening."

They sat in comfortable silence, watching the stars multiply as the sky darkened. The night was peaceful, the shrine quiet, the world holding its breath in the space between days.

Twenty-five days down. The building continued.

⁂

## Day 26

---

## Friday, April 28, 1989

---

The morning arrived with purpose restored.

Sheldon woke early, not from external schedule but from internal momentum. The assessment was complete; the plan was formed. Today began the work of clearing the workshop space—the first step toward the repair shop that would provide income and purpose.

The warmth hummed in his chest, acknowledging the significance of beginning. Yesterday had been planning; today was action.

He dressed and stepped onto the engawa, greeting the dawn with quiet anticipation. The sky was clear, the air fresh with the promise of a good working day. Spring was deepening toward summer, the mornings growing warmer, the days lengthening toward their seasonal peak.

---

Breakfast was purposeful, fuel for labor.

"The clearing work begins today," Sheldon announced, as Katsuhito served rice and soup. "The workshop space requires preparation before any refinement can occur."

"Heavy work," the old man observed. "The debris has accumulated over years."

"Yes. But necessary. The space cannot be used until it is emptied of what remains."

Tenchi appeared, already dressed for school, his hair slightly askew from hasty morning preparation. Hikaru followed at his heels, the kitten's morning escort duties faithfully performed.

"Today's the day?" the boy asked, settling at his place. "You're cleaning out the workshop?"

"Beginning to. The work will take more than one day."

"And I can help? After school?"

"If you are willing. There are tasks appropriate for your assistance—carrying smaller items, sorting salvageable materials, general cleaning once the heavy lifting is complete."

Tenchi's face lit with the particular joy of inclusion. "I'll come straight home. I won't be late."

"There is no need to rush. The work will continue regardless of precise timing."

"But I want to help as much as I can." His earnestness was evident. "This is important."

"It is. But your education is also important. Attend to school first; the house will wait."

---

The walk to the house was familiar now, the path requiring no conscious navigation.

Sheldon's mind turned to the work ahead—the sequence of tasks, the logistics of removal, the decisions about what to keep and what to discard. The workshop space was cluttered with decades of accumulated material, layers of occupation compressed into a single room.

He arrived to find the house unchanged from the previous day's assessment, the morning light illuminating dust motes that drifted through the still air. The completed main room glowed with fresh tatami, a reminder of what transformation was possible. The workshop space waited, patient and cluttered.

The first task was simple: open the windows and doors, allow fresh air to circulate. The space had been closed for years, the air stale with accumulated time. Ventilation would make the work more pleasant and begin the process of renewal.

With light and air entering the room, Sheldon could assess the challenge more clearly. The debris was stratified—older materials buried beneath newer additions, each layer representing a different period of the house's history. Furniture fragments lay tangled with household goods, textiles decomposed alongside ceramic shards, paper moldered into unreadable masses.

"Layer by layer," he decided aloud. "Start at the top, work down. Sort as we go."

---

The work was physical and meditative.

Sheldon established a system: items were removed from the room, examined in better light, and sorted into categories. Salvageable materials went to one area—the chest he had discovered the previous day, a few tools that might be restored, ceramic pieces that remained intact. Disposal materials went to another area—broken items beyond repair, textiles too deteriorated for use, paper and organic matter that had succumbed to time and moisture.

A third category emerged as the work progressed: items of uncertain status. These were things that might have value but whose purpose was unclear, pieces that might be salvageable with effort but whose worth was questionable. This pile grew faster than Sheldon had anticipated—the house contained many things that fell between obvious value and obvious waste.

The physical nature of the work was satisfying in ways that surprised him. His previous life had been largely cerebral—thinking, writing, analyzing. The body had been a transport mechanism for the brain, maintained adequately but not engaged meaningfully. Here, in this cluttered room, the body was the primary instrument. Muscles lifted, carried, set down. Joints bent and straightened in repetitive patterns. Sweat formed and evaporated, the cooling mechanism of exertion.

The morning passed in steady labor. Sheldon developed a rhythm—lift, carry, examine, sort, return. His muscles warmed to the work, the physical effort generating its own satisfaction. Sweat formed on his brow, was wiped away, formed again. The warmth in his chest seemed to pulse in time with his heartbeat, as though the system within him approved of honest labor.

Among the debris, he found items that spoke of the house's history. A child's toy—a wooden horse, crudely carved but lovingly worn smooth by small hands. Who had played with this? How old had they been? The toy went to the uncertain pile, its historical interest outweighing its practical value.

A bundle of letters, tied with string long since deteriorated, the paper too fragile to unfold without damage. The characters visible on the outer sheets were elegant, suggesting education and care. Love letters? Business correspondence? The story was lost, locked in paper that would crumble if disturbed. These went to disposal, reluctantly—there was no way to preserve what they contained.

Kitchen implements of unfamiliar design, their purposes unclear. Specialized tools for forgotten tasks, created for needs that no longer existed. Some might be valuable as antiques; others were merely obsolete. Without expertise in historical household items, Sheldon could not judge. These went to uncertain.

By mid-morning, the room's surface layer had been cleared. The floor was now visible in most areas—wooden boards similar to the kitchen, dusty but intact. The grain of the wood was visible where decades of grime had been disturbed, suggesting quality construction beneath the neglect.

The walls showed their construction more clearly, the post-and-beam structure evident now that obscuring clutter had been removed. Sheldon could see where later additions had been attached—panels of different wood, newer nails, the evidence of modification over time. The original building had been expanded, altered, adapted to changing needs.

"Progress," Sheldon noted, surveying the change. "Visible progress."

The words felt inadequate to the satisfaction. After days of planning and assessment, of learning and preparing, this was tangible change. The room was different now than it had been this morning. His effort had created that difference.

---

Tanaka arrived unexpectedly, his approach announced by the crunch of gravel.

The old blacksmith appeared at the doorway, examining the work with professional interest. He carried a small bundle—lunch, from the look of it.

"I thought you might forget to eat," he explained, setting down the bundle. "Absorbed workers often do."

"I appreciate the thoughtfulness. I had not noticed the time."

"That is how useful work feels. The hours pass without marking themselves." Tanaka surveyed the clearing effort. "You have made good progress."

"The surface layer only. There is much more beneath."

"Always is. Buildings accumulate like geological strata—each period deposits its layer, which is then buried by the next." He stepped into the room, examining the exposed floor. "The boards appear sound. Similar condition to the kitchen?"

"I have not assessed them thoroughly. That comes after clearing is complete."

"Wise. No point evaluating what remains covered." Tanaka picked up a tool from the salvage pile—a small plane, its blade rusted but potentially recoverable. "This might be worth restoring. The body is good quality."

"I was uncertain. It requires work, but the work might be worthwhile."

"Most things worth having require work. The question is whether the result justifies the effort." He turned the plane in his hands, examining it from multiple angles. "This one might. The sole is flat, the mouth is properly sized. The rust is surface only."

"I will add it to the definite salvage, then."

"Do. I will help you restore it when the time comes."

---

They ate lunch together in the cleared space.

Tanaka's bundle contained rice balls, pickled vegetables, and small dried fish—simple food, portable and nourishing. They sat on upturned buckets, the makeshift seating now familiar from the tatami work. The spring sun fell through the open windows, warming the space, illuminating the dust that still hung in the air.

"The room reveals itself as it empties," Tanaka observed. "You can see now what it might become."

"I can. The proportions are good—large enough for a workbench, storage, customer area. The light is adequate, though additional windows might improve it."

"Windows can be added. The wall facing south would benefit from one—catch the afternoon light for detail work. Nothing worse than trying to see fine tolerances in shadow."

"That would require a carpenter."

"Yamada, perhaps. He did work for the shrine several years ago—reliable, competent, reasonable in price." Tanaka finished a rice ball, chewing thoughtfully. "He is getting older now, like all of us, but his skills remain sharp. His son works with him, learning the trade."

"Another generational transmission."

"The village is full of them. The young inherit from the old, or they leave and the knowledge dies. We are fortunate when the inheritance continues." A note of melancholy touched his voice. "Not all families are so fortunate."

Sheldon understood the reference to Hideo, the son who had died, the inheritance that had been interrupted. He let the moment pass without comment, respecting the grief that still lived within the old man.

"I can introduce you when the time is right," Tanaka continued, his voice steadying. "When you are ready for the window work, I will speak to Yamada. He will give you fair treatment."

"I would appreciate that. The network of connections grows."

"That is how villages function. Each person knows others who know others. The web of relationships enables everything." He gestured at the space around them, the cleared floor, the exposed walls. "This house existed within that web once. It is being rewoven now."

"Through my presence?"

"Through your presence, your work, your willingness to engage. A house is not merely a building—it is a node in the community's structure. When it is occupied and active, it strengthens the whole. When it is abandoned, the web weakens." Tanaka's voice carried conviction. "The village noticed when this house went empty. Not consciously, perhaps, but something was felt to be missing."

"And now?"

"Now that absence is being addressed. The node is reconnecting to the network. Your repair shop will serve customers, which creates relationships. Those relationships will multiply, interweave, strengthen. Eventually, this house will be as integrated as any other."

Sheldon considered this perspective. The house as a node, a point of connection in a larger network. His restoration was not merely personal—it contributed to the community's integrity.

"I had not thought of it in those terms."

"Few newcomers do. They see their own needs, their own projects. They do not always recognize how their individual actions affect the collective." Tanaka's voice was gentle, instructive rather than critical. "You are learning to see the connections. This is good."

"Katsuhito-san mentioned something similar last night. About how my presence affects the household, not just how the household affects me."

"The perspective shift is important. We exist in relation to others; our actions ripple outward. Understanding this transforms how we approach everything—work, relationships, community. The isolated individual is a fiction. In reality, we are all nodes in a web."

---

The afternoon brought continued clearing.

Tanaka departed after lunch, his visit a gesture of support rather than an expectation of prolonged involvement. "I will leave you to your work," he said, gathering his tools. "The labor is yours; I would only be in the way." The words carried respect rather than dismissal—the recognition that some tasks require solitary focus.

Sheldon returned to the work, the rhythm reestablished, the progress continuing. The afternoon light shifted as hours passed, moving across the floor in slow progression, illuminating different portions of the room as the sun traced its arc.

The deeper layers revealed older materials—items from earlier periods of the house's history. A ledger book, its pages too damaged to read, but its existence suggesting commercial activity. The Tsukino family had been craftsmen, furniture makers—perhaps this recorded their transactions, their customers, their accounts. The information was lost now, the ink faded, the paper crumbling. But the object itself testified to a business that had operated here, a trade that had sustained a family.

Ceramic vessels of unfamiliar design appeared as the clearing progressed—perhaps from the Tsukino family's furniture-making days. Some were clearly functional: storage containers, water vessels, simple utilitarian pieces. Others were more decorative, their surfaces painted with patterns that suggested special purpose. Wedding gifts? Festival items? Objects with meaning now lost because no one remained to explain them.

Metal fittings and hardware emerged from the deeper layers—hinges, latches, brackets, fasteners. Some were too corroded to identify, their original forms dissolved by rust and time. Others were potentially salvageable, their function still apparent despite surface damage. Sheldon sorted them individually, examining each piece for signs of recoverable quality.

One set of hinges caught his attention. They were larger than household hardware, designed for heavy doors or perhaps furniture. The construction was sophisticated—not simple pivot points but carefully engineered mechanisms with multiple bearing surfaces. These had been made by someone who understood forces, who anticipated the stresses that hinges would face over years of use.

"Tsukino work, perhaps," Sheldon murmured, turning the hinges in his hands. "Made for furniture that required robust connection."

He set them aside for restoration. The rust was significant but surface-only; the underlying metal appeared sound. Tanaka could advise on the proper treatment, the techniques for recovering functional hardware from corroded pieces.

Each discovery prompted decisions. The ledger went to disposal, its information lost to time. The ceramics went to uncertain status, their potential value unclear. The metal fittings were sorted individually—some beyond recovery, others worth the effort of restoration.

"The house is telling its story," Sheldon murmured, examining a particularly corroded hinge. "Layer by layer, piece by piece."

The hinge had been well-made once—the design was sophisticated, the mechanism complex. Time and moisture had reduced it to a rusted mass, but the craftsmanship remained visible in the underlying structure. Someone had created this object with care, with attention, with skill. A craftsman, generations ago, had devoted effort to making something that would serve well. Now that service was ending.

"Disposal," he decided reluctantly. "Beyond restoration."

The decision felt like a small loss—the erasure of someone's careful work, the end of an object's useful existence. But the house could not become a museum of every degraded item. Function required clearing; clearing required decisions. Sentiment could not override practicality indefinitely.

---

Tenchi arrived precisely when expected.

The boy appeared at the yard's edge, school bag discarded at the shrine, his expression eager. He had clearly hurried, despite Sheldon's admonition not to rush—the evidence was in his slightly breathless arrival, his flushed cheeks.

"I'm here! What can I do?"

"First, catch your breath. The work is not fleeing."

Tenchi took several deep breaths, visibly calming himself. His eagerness was endearing, his desire to contribute genuine.

"Okay. I'm ready now."

"Good. Come, I will show you what has been accomplished and explain what remains."

They entered the workshop space together, Tenchi's eyes widening at the transformation. The room that had been impassable yesterday was now largely clear, the floor visible, the walls exposed.

"You did all this today?"

"Since this morning, yes. The surface layers are cleared. The deeper work remains, but the heaviest lifting is largely complete."

"It looks so different. Like a real room now."

"It is becoming a real room. The process continues."

Sheldon explained the sorting system—salvage, disposal, uncertain. He showed Tenchi the categories, the criteria for each, the thinking behind the decisions.

"Some things are obviously good and should be kept. Some things are obviously beyond use and should be discarded. Many things fall between—they might be worth keeping, but we are not certain. Those require more consideration."

"What happens to the uncertain pile?"

"Eventually, decisions must be made. But for now, we preserve options. Better to consider carefully than to discard something valuable in haste."

Tenchi nodded, absorbing the lesson. "So I should sort things into the three piles?"

"Yes. I will show you examples from each category, then you can begin working on the smaller items while I continue with the heavier materials."

---

The instruction was patient and thorough.

Sheldon demonstrated with multiple examples, explaining his reasoning for each decision. A ceramic bowl with a small chip—salvage, because the damage was minor and the piece was otherwise sound. A textile so deteriorated it fell apart when touched—disposal, because no restoration could recover it. A wooden container of unknown purpose—uncertain, because its condition was acceptable but its use was unclear.

"The goal is not to make perfect decisions," Sheldon emphasized. "The goal is to make reasonable ones based on available information. When you are unsure, place items in the uncertain pile. We can evaluate them together later."

"What if I make a mistake?"

"Then we correct it. Mistakes in sorting are not permanent—we can move items between piles as understanding improves. The important thing is to engage thoughtfully, to consider each item rather than discarding everything automatically."

"Like thinking about each thing separately?"

"Exactly. Each object deserves individual attention, even if that attention is brief. The process of consideration matters as much as the outcome."

Tenchi nodded, his expression serious with concentration. He approached the task with the gravity of someone given genuine responsibility—not play-acting at usefulness, but actually contributing.

He took up his position near a pile of smaller items—the fragments and pieces that had accumulated at the edges of the room. His small hands proved well-suited to the detail work, able to handle objects that Sheldon's larger grip found awkward. He examined each piece carefully, turning it in his fingers, considering its condition and potential.

"This is kind of like archaeology," Tenchi observed, examining a small piece of decorated ceramic. "Finding things from the past and trying to understand them."

"The comparison is apt. The house contains layers of history, and we are uncovering them. Each object tells a story about the people who lived here."

"What does this one tell?" He held up the ceramic fragment—part of a bowl or cup, decorated with simple blue patterns. The design was traditional, the kind found on everyday household items throughout Japan.

"That someone valued beauty. The decoration served no functional purpose—it did not make the vessel hold more or last longer. It existed only to please the eye. Someone chose to create or purchase something beautiful rather than something merely adequate."

"So they were... artistic?"

"Or they appreciated artistry. The two are different—creating beauty and recognizing it require different skills. Many people who cannot create beautiful things can nonetheless appreciate them deeply."

"Like how I can't play music but I like listening to it?"

"Exactly like that. The appreciation is genuine even when the creation is beyond your capability."

Tenchi considered this, then placed the fragment in the uncertain pile. "I don't know if we should keep it. It's pretty, but it's also broken."

"A reasonable assessment. The prettiness argues for keeping; the brokenness argues against. When the considerations balance, uncertainty is the appropriate response."

"What will happen to the uncertain pile at the end?"

"We will go through it together, item by item, and make final decisions. Some things will move to salvage; others will move to disposal. The intermediate category is not permanent—it is a holding space for decisions that require more thought."

"Like when you can't decide and you need to think about it overnight?"

"Very much like that. Sometimes the best choice is to delay choosing until more information or perspective is available."

They worked in companionable silence for a while, each focused on their portion of the task. The room grew quieter as afternoon lengthened, the sounds of the village fading as activities wound down toward evening.

---

The work continued as the afternoon lengthened.

Tenchi proved a capable assistant—his attention remained focused, his sorting decisions generally reasonable, his questions thoughtful. He worked steadily without complaint, treating the task as important rather than as tedious duty.

"You are working well," Sheldon observed, during a brief pause.

"It feels important. Like I'm helping with something real." Tenchi examined another fragment. "Not like school, where everything is just practice for later. This is actual now."

"School has its purpose. The skills you learn there will serve you throughout life."

"I know. But it's different. Reading about things is different from doing them."

"It is. Both matter, though. Understanding and action complement each other—action without understanding is blind, understanding without action is hollow."

"Did someone teach you that?"

"Many people, over many years. Wisdom accumulates from multiple sources."

"Like these layers." Tenchi gestured at the room. "Each source adds something, and eventually there's a lot."

"Precisely. The analogy extends well—just as we must sort through accumulated materials, we must sort through accumulated ideas. Some are valuable and should be kept. Some are no longer useful and should be released. Some require further consideration."

"How do you know which ideas to keep?"

"Testing, primarily. Ideas that work when applied are worth keeping. Ideas that fail when tested should be revised or discarded. Ideas that cannot be tested must be evaluated by other means—consistency, elegance, coherence with other beliefs."

"That sounds complicated."

"It can be. But the process becomes more natural with practice, just as sorting becomes faster as you learn to recognize the categories."

---

The light began to fade as evening approached.

Sheldon called a halt to the work, the progress substantial but the day's energy depleted. The room was now largely clear—only the deepest layer remained, the oldest materials that had been buried longest.

"We accomplished much today," he told Tenchi. "More than I expected."

"Your help made a significant difference. Many hands make light work."

"That's what Grandfather says about the shrine festivals. Everyone helping together."

"The principle applies broadly. Collective effort achieves what individual effort cannot."

They surveyed the transformed space together. The workshop was visible now—its dimensions clear, its potential apparent. What had been an impassable chaos was now an empty room awaiting purpose.

"Tomorrow we can finish the clearing," Tenchi said. "And then start on the real work."

"Tomorrow is Saturday. You do not have school."

"I know! So I can help all day, not just after school." His enthusiasm was evident. "We can get so much done."

"We can. If the weather holds and our energy permits."

"The weather will be good. I can tell."

"How can you tell?"

"The way the sunset looks. Grandfather taught me—red sky at night means good weather tomorrow. And look." He pointed west, where the setting sun painted the clouds in shades of orange and crimson. "Red sky."

"Then we will have good weather for continuing the work."

---

They returned to the shrine together.

The walk was comfortable, Tenchi's hand finding Sheldon's as they navigated the darkening path. The evening air was cooling but not cold, the seasonal warmth lingering even after sunset. Birdsong accompanied them—the last calls of birds settling for the night, the first tentative notes of nocturnal creatures.

Tenchi's chatter was continuous—observations about the day's work, questions about tomorrow's plans, thoughts about what the workshop would eventually become. His energy, though depleted by physical labor, seemed recharged by conversation.

"Will you fix all kinds of things? Or just certain kinds?"

"All kinds, I hope. Whatever the village needs—household items, tools, small equipment. The specific focus will emerge based on what people bring."

"What if someone brings something you don't know how to fix?"

"Then I will learn. Every repair is an opportunity to develop new skills. Some problems will be beyond my capability, at least initially—those I will have to decline or refer to others. But the goal is to be useful across a wide range of needs."

"Like a general store, but for fixing instead of selling."

"That is an apt comparison. A general repair shop, equipped to address whatever the community requires."

"Like Tanaka-san, but with different things."

"Similar. He works with metal and tools; I will work with general repairs. The approaches overlap but the specializations differ."

"Do you think you'll be busy? Will lots of people bring things?"

"I hope so. Villages generate constant need for repair—things break, wear out, malfunction. If I can address those needs competently and fairly, customers should come."

"What if they don't?"

"Then I will adapt. Perhaps seek customers from neighboring areas, or develop additional services, or find other ways to be useful. Flexibility is essential when starting something new."

"You always have backup plans."

"I try to. The future is uncertain; multiple paths help ensure that some route forward remains available regardless of what happens."

"Maybe someday you'll teach someone like he teaches you."

"Perhaps. If I develop enough expertise, and if someone wishes to learn. Teaching requires both knowledge and willingness on both sides."

"I want to learn. Not now, because I'm too young and I have school. But someday."

"Someday we can discuss it. For now, focus on growing up—there will be time for specialization later."

"How old do I have to be?"

"Old enough to make informed decisions about your future. Apprenticeship is a serious commitment—years of learning under supervision. It should not be entered lightly."

"How old were you when you started learning things?"

Sheldon considered the question carefully. His education had begun in childhood, but his serious learning—the physics that had consumed his previous life—had started in adolescence. "I began formal study of my field at about fourteen. But the groundwork was laid earlier, through reading and experimentation."

"So maybe when I'm fourteen I could start learning repairs?"

"We will see. Much depends on what interests you by then, what opportunities exist, what path seems best. The future is not fixed; we will navigate it as it unfolds."

The shrine appeared through the trees, its familiar structures welcoming in the evening light. Hikaru waited at the entrance to the residence, his greeting meow carrying across the quiet grounds. The kitten had developed the habit of monitoring arrivals, appearing whenever someone approached the living quarters.

"He knows we're coming," Tenchi said. "He always knows."

"Cats have excellent hearing. He probably detected our footsteps well before we came into view."

"Or maybe he just knows. Like how I know when you're nearby even when I can't see you."

"Familiarity creates patterns. We learn to recognize those we love through many channels, not just sight."

"The sound of your footsteps is different from Grandfather's. Yours are heavier and faster. His are slower and more careful."

"You have observed this?"

"Not on purpose. But I noticed it one day, and now I always know who's coming." Tenchi picked up Hikaru, cuddling the kitten against his chest. "That's kind of like how Hikaru knows. He's learned our patterns."

"Pattern recognition is a fundamental form of intelligence. Both humans and animals use it to navigate the world."

"So Hikaru is intelligent?"

"In his way. Not the same kind of intelligence as humans, but intelligence nonetheless. He learns, adapts, remembers, anticipates. These are all signs of a working mind."

"I think he's very smart. For a cat."

"He does seem unusually perceptive. Perhaps being raised with attention has developed his capabilities."

They entered the residence together, the warmth of the household embracing them. The day's labor was complete; the evening's rest awaited.

---

Dinner was a celebration of the day's work.

Katsuhito had prepared a slightly more elaborate meal, acknowledging the milestone of beginning actual restoration work. Fish grilled with special attention, vegetables arranged with care, rice seasoned with ingredients that elevated it beyond the everyday. The kitchen was warm with cooking smells, welcoming after the dusty labor of the afternoon.

"The clearing progresses well," Sheldon reported, as they settled at the table. "Tenchi's assistance was genuinely valuable."

"He came home with stories," Katsuhito replied, his eyes crinkling with amusement. "Full accounts of the sorting system, the decisions required, the artifacts discovered. I heard about ceramic fragments and mysterious tools for nearly an hour."

"I was excited," Tenchi defended, slightly embarrassed. "It was interesting!"

"I am not criticizing. Your enthusiasm shows engagement, which is valuable." Katsuhito served the fish with practiced movements. "Too many children approach work as obligation rather than opportunity. You found meaning in the task."

"I learned a lot," Tenchi added, recovering his enthusiasm. "About making decisions when you're not sure, and about how houses hold layers like archaeology, and about how things can be beautiful even when they're broken."

"Practical wisdom, then. The best kind."

The meal continued with discussion of the work—what had been cleared, what remained, what the completed space might become. Tenchi contributed enthusiastically, his sense of investment evident in his detailed recollections.

"We found hinges," he reported. "Big ones, bigger than the ones on our doors. Tsukino-san thinks they might be from the furniture the old family made."

"The Tsukino craftsmen were known for substantial pieces," Katsuhito confirmed. "Chests and cabinets that required robust hardware. If the hinges survived, they might be worth restoring."

"There were letters too. But they were too old to read—the paper fell apart when you touched it."

"Some things cannot be preserved. The information they contained is lost." Katsuhito's voice was philosophical. "This is the nature of time. Not everything survives, no matter how important it may have been."

"That seems sad."

"It is sad, in a way. But it is also natural. Each generation inherits what survives and creates new things to leave to the next. The cycle continues regardless of individual losses."

"Tomorrow we finish the clearing," Tenchi announced, steering the conversation toward a more cheerful topic. "And then the real work starts."

"The real work has already started," Sheldon corrected gently. "Clearing is not preliminary to work—it is work. Each stage of restoration is equally important."

"But it's not the interesting part. The interesting part is when you actually fix things."

"All parts can be interesting if approached correctly. Finding the ceramic fragments, learning the house's history, deciding what to keep—these are interesting if you engage with them thoughtfully."

"I guess so. It was kind of interesting, sorting things. Like solving small puzzles."

"Life is largely composed of small puzzles. The ability to find interest in them makes existence richer."

Katsuhito nodded approvingly. "This is wisdom that took me many years to learn. Small satisfactions, accumulated consistently, produce more happiness than rare large ones. The person who can find joy in daily tasks lives better than one who waits for spectacular occasions."

"Like how you enjoy morning tea," Tenchi observed. "Even though it's the same every day."

"Precisely. The tea is familiar, but familiarity does not preclude appreciation. Each cup is a small satisfaction, and the accumulation of many cups over many years produces deep contentment."

The conversation continued as the meal wound down, ranging across topics that emerged naturally from the day's events. The household was comfortable in its routines now, the three of them fitting together like pieces that had found their proper positions.

---

Bedtime arrived with pleasant exhaustion.

Tenchi was tired from the physical work, his young body unaccustomed to extended labor. He submitted to the routine without resistance, settling into his futon with the boneless relaxation of genuine fatigue.

"My arms are tired," he observed. "From all the carrying."

"Physical work exercises muscles that everyday activity does not engage. The tiredness is evidence of effort—it will fade, and the muscles will be stronger."

"Will I be sore tomorrow?"

"Possibly. But soreness is not injury—it is the body's response to novel demands. It passes within a day or two."

"Grandfather says the same thing about training. That the pain means you're improving."

"Within limits. There is useful discomfort that accompanies growth, and harmful pain that indicates injury. Learning to distinguish them is important."

Tenchi yawned, his eyes heavy. Hikaru had already claimed his position at the foot of the futon, the kitten's warmth a familiar comfort.

"Today was a good day," Tenchi murmured. "I felt useful."

"You were useful. Your contribution made genuine difference."

"I want to be useful more. Not just with the house, but with everything."

"That desire is admirable. Act on it consistently, and usefulness becomes habitual."

"Habitual?"

"Automatic. Something you do without having to decide to do it. The best qualities become habits—we practice them until they require no effort."

"Like being kind?"

"Exactly. At first, kindness requires conscious choice. With practice, it becomes reflexive—we are kind without having to remember to be."

Tenchi's eyes closed, sleep claiming him mid-thought. Sheldon adjusted the blankets, ensuring warmth against the cooling night, then rose and departed quietly.

---

On the engawa, the red sky had faded to deep blue.

Twenty-six days. The first day of actual clearing work, the beginning of transformation in the workshop space. Tenchi had participated, contributed, learned. The web of involvement expanded.

Katsuhito joined him as had become customary, the evening ritual now firmly established.

"He worked well today," the old man observed. "Genuinely helpful, not merely present."

"He did. His attention remained focused, his decisions reasonable. He has capacity for sustained effort."

"Good qualities for whatever he eventually pursues. The specific direction matters less than the underlying character."

"I told him we might discuss the repair work someday, when he is older. He expressed interest in learning."

"He expresses interest in many things. Whether that interest persists remains to be seen." Katsuhito's voice was affectionate. "But the desire to learn, to be useful—these are promising signs."

"He said he wants to be useful more. Not just with the house, but with everything."

"A noble aspiration. May he achieve it."

They sat in comfortable silence, the stars emerging one by one. The night was peaceful, the work of the day settling into memory, the work of tomorrow waiting patiently.

"The clearing will be complete tomorrow, you think?" Katsuhito asked.

"Likely. The deepest layer remains, but it is also the smallest. A full day's work should suffice."

"And then?"

"Floor assessment, cleaning, preparation. Then the workbench and storage. Then, eventually, customers."

"The sequence is clear."

"It is. The uncertainty lies in timing and details, not in direction."

"That is all one can ask. Clear direction, flexible execution." Katsuhito rose, indicating his intention to retire. "Sleep well. Tomorrow continues the work."

"Sleep well. Thank you for the meal."

The old man departed, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars. The night was quiet, the world at rest, the future waiting to unfold.

Twenty-six days down. The building continued.

⁂

## Day 27

---

## Saturday, April 29, 1989

---

The morning arrived with promised good weather.

Tenchi's prediction had proven accurate—the sky was clear, the air fresh, the red sunset having delivered on its meteorological promise. Sheldon woke to the quality of light that signaled a productive day ahead, the kind of brightness that made labor feel like opportunity rather than obligation.

The warmth hummed in his chest, acknowledging the satisfaction of having a full day to work. No school schedule constrained the hours; no appointments limited the effort. The clearing could be completed today, the workshop space fully prepared for its next phase.

He rose and dressed with purpose, the routine now automatic, the body knowing its movements without conscious direction.

---

Breakfast was animated, Tenchi's excitement evident from the moment he appeared.

"No school today!" The boy's declaration carried the particular joy of weekend freedom. "We can work all day!"

"We can work as long as our energy permits," Sheldon agreed. "Which may not be all day. Physical labor depletes the body; rest becomes necessary."

"I'm not tired at all. I could work forever."

"A feeling that will modify as the hours pass. But the enthusiasm is appreciated."

Katsuhito served the morning meal with his usual calm attention, the contrast with Tenchi's energy providing balance. "The clearing will be complete today?"

"I expect so. The deepest layer is also the smallest. With both of us working, the task should be finished by midday or early afternoon."

"And then?"

"Floor assessment, cleaning, planning for the next phase. The workshop requires preparation before it can serve its purpose."

"A sensible sequence." The old man poured tea, the ritual movements unchanged despite the conversation. "I may visit later to observe the completed space."

"You would be welcome. The transformation is significant—the room looks entirely different from when we began."

Hikaru appeared, drawn by the activity and the promise of breakfast scraps. Tenchi greeted the kitten with his usual affection, offering a small bit of fish that was accepted with delicate precision.

"He's getting bigger," Tenchi observed. "His paws especially."

"Kittens grow rapidly in their first months. The large paws suggest he will be a substantial adult cat."

"Good. Big cats are best for catching mice."

"A practical consideration. The house will benefit from resident pest control once it is occupied."

"Can Hikaru live there too? When you move in?"

"We will see. Cats adapt to new environments, but he has become comfortable here. The decision depends on many factors."

---

The walk to the house was familiar, comfortable.

Tenchi held Sheldon's hand as they navigated the village paths, his chatter filling the morning air. The topics ranged freely—observations about neighbors they passed, questions about the day's work, plans for what the workshop would eventually become.

"When you start fixing things, can I watch sometimes?"

"When appropriate and safe. Some repairs involve tools or materials that require caution. But observation of suitable work would be educational."

"I want to learn what you learn. So I can help more."

"Learning takes time. The skills I am developing come from weeks of instruction and practice. You cannot absorb them instantly."

"I know. But I can start learning, right? Even if I don't finish for a long time?"

"You can always start learning. The beginning is the easiest part—it is the continuation that proves difficult."

"Why is continuation hard?"

"Because novelty fades. The excitement of starting something new gives way to the effort of sustained practice. Many people begin things and few finish them, because the middle is less thrilling than the beginning."

"How do you keep going when the middle gets boring?"

"Discipline, habit, commitment. You remind yourself why the goal matters and you continue despite the reduced excitement. Over time, the satisfaction of progress replaces the thrill of novelty."

"Like brushing teeth. It's not exciting, but you do it every day because you know it's important."

"An excellent analogy. Yes, exactly like that."

The house came into view, its familiar form welcoming in the morning light. The main room's windows glowed with the warm tones of new tatami, visible proof of what restoration could achieve. The workshop space waited, nearly cleared, ready for its final transformation.

---

The work resumed with established rhythm.

Tenchi immediately went to his station—the pile of smaller items that required sorting. His focus was impressive, his attention sustained despite the repetitive nature of the task. He examined each piece with care, considered its condition, made his decision, placed it in the appropriate category. His small hands moved with growing confidence, the patterns of the previous day's learning now becoming automatic.

Sheldon tackled the remaining larger items—the deepest layer, the oldest materials. These were the things that had been buried longest, the artifacts of the house's earliest period. Some were recognizable: furniture fragments, household implements, construction materials. Others were mysterious: objects whose purpose was unclear, whose function had been forgotten.

The physical work had a different quality today—less exploratory, more efficient. The system was established, the categories clear. Each item could be assessed quickly against known criteria, the decisions flowing without extended deliberation.

Among the deeper materials, Sheldon found what appeared to be sample pieces—small sections of wood with different finishes, demonstrating various techniques. These were clearly from the Tsukino furniture-making days, reference pieces showing what was possible. Some bore labels in faded ink: "walnut stain," "lacquer type three," "oil finish spring application."

"These are samples," he realized aloud. "Examples of different finishes the family used in their work."

Tenchi looked up from his sorting. "What do samples mean?"

"They show options. When a customer wanted furniture, they could see different finishes and choose which they preferred. The samples demonstrated what was available."

"Like a menu?"

"Exactly like a menu. A visual menu of appearance options."

"That's clever. Should we keep them?"

"Definitely. They document the Tsukino craft. They have historical value even if they serve no practical purpose."

The samples went to salvage, carefully separated from the debris. Sheldon handled them gently, aware that he was preserving evidence of a craft tradition that had ended.

"This is weird," Tenchi called, holding up a small metal device. "What is it?"

Sheldon examined the object—a complex mechanism of gears and levers, small enough to fit in a palm. The metal was dark with age but not severely corroded. The craftsmanship was evident in the precise fitting of components. The gears meshed smoothly when he tested them, the mechanism still functional despite years of neglect.

"I am not certain. It appears to be a mechanical device of some kind. Perhaps a tool for furniture-making, or a mechanism from a larger piece."

"It moves," Tenchi observed, as Sheldon demonstrated the gears. "So it still works."

"The mechanism functions. Its purpose remains unclear."

"Should I keep it?"

"Put it in uncertain. We can examine it more closely later, perhaps consult with Tanaka-san. He may recognize the design."

The work continued, the morning hours passing in productive rhythm. The deepest layer yielded its contents gradually—each piece examined, assessed, sorted. The pile of remaining unsorted items shrank steadily, the floor beneath becoming visible in expanding patches.

More discoveries emerged as they progressed. A collection of hand-carved decorative elements—flourishes and finials that would have adorned furniture pieces. A set of specialized chisels, their edges dulled but their forms intact. A bound notebook containing sketches of furniture designs, the pages yellowed but the drawings still visible.

"These are designs," Sheldon said, carefully turning the notebook's pages. "Plans for pieces the family made."

"Like blueprints?"

"Similar. They show the proportions, the details, the elements that made each piece distinctive." The drawings were skilled—precise lines indicating dimensions, shaded areas showing decorative elements, notes in neat handwriting specifying materials and techniques. "This is valuable. A record of their work."

"It's like finding treasure," Tenchi said, his eyes wide. "Real treasure from the past."

"In a way. Not monetary treasure, but historical treasure. Evidence of who lived here and what they accomplished."

By mid-morning, the last of the debris had been removed. The workshop space stood empty, its bare floor exposed, its walls revealed. The room was larger than it had seemed when cluttered—the proportions generous, the ceiling high, the space adequate for serious work.

"It's done," Tenchi breathed, looking around with wonder. "It's really empty now."

"The clearing is complete. The room is ready for its next phase."

"It looks so different. Like a completely different place."

"It is the same place, revealed. The clutter obscured what was always present. The room's true nature was hidden, waiting to be discovered."

---

They surveyed the completed space together.

The floor was dusty but sound—wooden boards similar to those in the kitchen, darkened with age but structurally intact. Sheldon walked the perimeter, testing each section with careful steps. No soft spots, no obvious damage, no signs of the rot that had affected the main room.

"The floor appears healthy," he reported. "We will need to clean and possibly seal it, but replacement seems unnecessary."

"That's good, right? Less work?"

"Less work, less cost, faster progress. All good things."

The walls showed their construction clearly now—the post-and-beam framework visible, the infill panels intact. The partition that Tanaka had identified as a later addition was obvious, its materials different from the surrounding structure.

"That wall isn't original," Sheldon explained. "It was added later, dividing what was once a larger space."

"Can we remove it?"

"Possibly. It would restore the original dimensions, create a larger workspace. But that decision requires more consideration—the cost, the effort, whether the larger space is actually needed."

"More space seems better."

"Not always. A space that is too large feels empty, unfocused. The appropriate size depends on the intended use. For a repair shop, the current dimensions may be adequate."

Tenchi walked the room himself, his small feet testing the floor as he had observed Sheldon do. His movements were deliberate, investigative—learning through imitation.

"It's solid," he pronounced. "No squishy parts."

"Your assessment agrees with mine. The floor is sound."

"What happens next?"

"Cleaning, assessment of details, planning for equipment. The workbench, storage, tools, lighting. Many decisions remain before the space is functional."

"But the hard part is done?"

"The clearing is done. Whether that was the hard part remains to be seen—each phase presents its own challenges."

---

Lunch was eaten in the empty workshop.

They sat on the floor, their simple meal spread between them. Sheldon had brought rice balls and pickled vegetables, simple food prepared that morning in anticipation of the day's labor. The space felt different occupied—less like an archaeological excavation, more like a room awaiting purpose. Light fell through the windows in long rectangles, illuminating dust motes that drifted in the still air.

"I like it here," Tenchi said, looking around with satisfaction. "It feels peaceful."

"Empty spaces often do. The absence of clutter allows the mind to rest. There is nothing demanding attention, nothing requiring decision."

"Is that why shrines are so clean? To make people feel peaceful?"

"Partly. The cleanliness serves multiple purposes—practical hygiene, aesthetic beauty, spiritual purity. The peace is a result of all three working together."

"Grandfather says the shrine should feel different from regular places. Sacred."

"This space is not sacred, but it could feel special in its own way. A place dedicated to useful work, to restoration and repair. Not divine purpose, but meaningful purpose nonetheless."

"Making things better is meaningful?"

"Very much so. The world contains much that is broken, damaged, worn. Those who repair it contribute to the common good. It is not the most glamorous work, but it is necessary and valuable."

Tenchi chewed thoughtfully on a rice ball, considering this. "So being a repair person is kind of like being a helper? Like a doctor, but for things instead of people?"

"That is a reasonable comparison. Doctors restore health to bodies; repair workers restore function to objects. Both address damage and return things to useful condition."

"I never thought of it that way. It sounds important when you say it like that."

"It is important. Every functional item in the world was made by someone and will eventually be maintained by someone. The chain of making and maintaining keeps civilization operating."

"That's a lot of responsibility."

"It is. But it is shared responsibility—many hands contribute to the whole. No single person maintains everything. Each does their part, and collectively the work is accomplished."

Tenchi looked around the empty room, his gaze settling on the windows. "When you're working here, will you be able to see outside?"

"Through the windows, yes. And we may add more windows, if additional light is needed."

"That would be nice. Working in a place where you can see trees and sky."

"The view matters. My previous work was often conducted in windowless rooms—laboratories and offices designed for concentration rather than connection to the outside world. I did not realize how much I missed natural light until I came here."

"Why would people work in rooms without windows?"

"To eliminate distractions, to control conditions, to focus entirely on the task at hand. The reasoning is sound, but the result is often isolating. Humans are not meant to be separated from nature entirely."

"I would hate working in a room with no windows."

"I did not hate it at the time—I was too absorbed in the work to notice what was missing. Only in retrospect do I recognize what the environment lacked."

"So you'll make sure your workshop has good windows?"

"I will ensure adequate natural light. A balance between sufficient illumination for detail work and connection to the outside world."

They finished their meal in comfortable silence, the room's emptiness creating a contemplative atmosphere. The sounds of the village filtered through the windows—distant voices, the call of birds, the ordinary music of a community going about its day.

---

The afternoon was devoted to the uncertain pile.

This was the accumulation of items that had resisted easy categorization—pieces that might have value but whose purpose was unclear, objects in intermediate condition, fragments that could be salvaged or discarded depending on perspective. The pile had grown over two days of sorting, representing the most difficult decisions.

"We will go through each item together," Sheldon explained, settling beside the pile. "I will explain my thinking, and you can ask questions or offer your own views."

"Like a lesson?"

"Like a shared decision-making process. Your perspective may notice things I miss. Children often see differently than adults—sometimes more clearly."

"Really?"

"Really. Adults develop patterns of perception that can become limiting. Children, not yet fixed in their ways, sometimes notice what adults overlook."

Tenchi straightened, clearly pleased by this acknowledgment of his potential contribution.

The first item was a ceramic vessel, cracked but not completely broken. The glaze was unusual—a deep blue with subtle variations that caught the light, suggesting skilled craftsmanship.

"The crack is significant but repairable," Sheldon assessed, turning the vessel carefully. "The vessel could be restored to functional use with proper treatment. The question is whether the restoration effort is worthwhile."

"Is the blue color rare?"

"I do not know enough about ceramics to say. It is certainly distinctive—the color has depth, almost like looking into water."

"Maybe we should ask someone who knows about old pottery?"

"A reasonable suggestion. This goes to salvage, pending expert opinion."

The next item was a wooden tool of uncertain purpose—a handle attached to a curved blade, too small for agricultural use, too large for kitchen work. The blade was slightly rusted but the edge was still visible, still sharp.

"What do you think this was for?" Sheldon asked.

Tenchi examined it carefully, turning it in his hands. "Maybe for cutting something specific? Like a special shape?"

"That is possible. Specialized tools often have forms that seem strange when separated from their intended task."

"The curve is weird. Like it's meant to go around something."

"Good observation. Perhaps for cutting material wrapped around a form, or for shaping curved surfaces."

"Can Tanaka-san tell us?"

"Perhaps. Or the tool may remain mysterious. Some knowledge is simply lost."

"That's sad."

"It is. But it is also natural. Not everything can be preserved; not every story can be told. We save what we can and accept that some things are beyond recovery."

The sorting continued, each item receiving attention and discussion. A fragment of carved wood, clearly part of a larger decorative piece. A metal bracket with unusual mounting holes. A piece of leather with embossed patterns, too damaged to serve any function but interesting in its detail. A wooden box with clever joinery, empty but beautiful in its construction.

"This box is special," Tenchi said, examining the joinery. "Look at how the corners fit together."

"The technique is called dovetail joinery. It is strong and decorative, requiring significant skill to execute well."

"Like the chest you found yesterday?"

"Similar, yes. The Tsukino family used these techniques throughout their work. This box was likely made as a sample or a gift—too small for practical storage, but demonstrating their skill."

"Should we keep it?"

"Definitely. It is a beautiful example of their craft."

The mysterious mechanical device received extended attention. Sheldon examined it more closely, testing its movements, observing how the gears interacted.

"There is a shaft here," he said, pointing to a small protrusion. "Something attached here—a handle, perhaps, or a connection to a larger mechanism."

"Maybe it made something spin?"

"Possibly. The gear ratios suggest it was designed to convert slow rotation to fast rotation—a few turns of an input shaft would produce many turns of an output."

"Like a... a speed machine?"

"In a sense. Speed reduction or multiplication, depending on which end receives the force."

"Could it be for a drill? Like the kind that spins really fast?"

Sheldon considered this. A hand-powered drill mechanism would require exactly this kind of gear ratio—converting the slow turning of a handle into rapid rotation of a bit. "That is a very plausible suggestion. You may have identified its purpose."

Tenchi grinned, pleased with his contribution. "I was just guessing."

"Sometimes guessing leads to correct answers. The important thing is to think about the problem, to consider possibilities. Your guess was informed by the evidence—the gear ratios, the shaft, the size. That is not random guessing; that is reasoning."

By late afternoon, the uncertain pile had been fully processed. Some items moved to salvage, others to disposal. A small collection of particularly interesting pieces—including the mysterious mechanism, now tentatively identified as a drill component—was set aside for consultation with Tanaka.

"We're done," Tenchi announced, surveying the organized results. "Everything is sorted."

"Everything is sorted. The clearing is truly complete."

"And we figured out what some of the mystery things were."

"We made progress. Some mysteries remain, but fewer than when we started."

---

Katsuhito arrived as they were finishing.

The old man appeared at the doorway, his robes slightly dusty from the walk, his expression curious. He surveyed the empty workshop with evident appreciation, his gaze moving systematically across the space.

"You have accomplished much."

"The space is ready for its next phase. The floor is sound, the walls intact, the debris removed."

Katsuhito stepped inside, his movements careful on the unfamiliar floor. He walked the perimeter as Sheldon had done, testing the boards, examining the construction. His attention was methodical, professional—the assessment of someone who had spent decades maintaining buildings.

"Solid work," he pronounced. "The Tsukino family built well."

"Tanaka-san said the same. The craftsmanship is evident in the structure."

"Traditional builders understood their materials. Wood, properly selected and joined, lasts for generations. Modern construction often lacks this quality—speed is valued over durability, cost over craftsmanship." He paused at the center of the room, looking around. "This will serve you well. The space has good proportions, adequate light, proper orientation."

"The orientation matters?"

"For any working space. This room faces east-south—it will receive morning sun, which warms the space early. The afternoon shade prevents overheating in summer. Someone considered these factors when designing the house."

"Details I would not have noticed."

"Details become apparent with experience. You will learn to see them as your knowledge develops. The first year, everything seems arbitrary. After ten years, you begin to perceive the reasoning behind choices. After thirty, the logic becomes obvious."

He examined the walls more closely, running his fingers along the joint between original construction and later addition. "This partition could be removed cleanly. The integration is competent but not structural. The room beyond would expand the space significantly."

"I had not decided about the partition. The current size may be adequate."

"It may be. But options are worth understanding. Knowing what is possible informs better decisions."

Tenchi had been watching the exchange, his attention shifting between the adults. "Grandfather, Tsukino-san says the repair shop is like being a doctor for things."

"An apt comparison. Your mother would have appreciated the analogy—she valued those who maintained the useful objects of daily life."

"She did?"

"She did. She often said that creation was only half the work; preservation was the other half. The things we make are worthless if they cannot be maintained."

"I didn't know that."

"There is much about her you have yet to learn. Her life contained many thoughts, many values, many interests. I share them as occasions arise."

"Can you tell me more? About what she thought about things?"

Katsuhito smiled gently. "I can tell you much. But not all at once—the telling must emerge naturally, connected to moments and experiences. Today, we learn that she valued maintenance and repair. Another day, we will learn something else."

"That seems like a slow way to learn about someone."

"It is. But it is also the way we come to know anyone—piece by piece, moment by moment. No one reveals themselves completely all at once. Even in a lifetime of knowing someone, there are always more layers to discover."

Sheldon watched this exchange quietly, aware that he was witnessing something delicate—the ongoing transmission of a mother's memory to her son. The process was Katsuhito's responsibility, but Sheldon's presence as witness added weight to the moment.

"We found things from the old family today," Tenchi continued. "Samples of wood finishes, and a notebook with furniture designs, and a box with really fancy corners."

"The Tsukino artifacts. These should be preserved."

"We are preserving them," Sheldon confirmed. "They document the craft tradition that once operated here."

"Good. Such documentation is valuable—not merely for historical interest, but for practical learning. Traditional techniques often contain wisdom that modern methods have forgotten."

---

They returned to the shrine together, all three.

The walk was leisurely, the day's work complete, the satisfaction of accomplishment creating a peaceful mood. The evening light was golden, the sun low in the sky, casting long shadows across the familiar path. Tenchi walked between the adults, his hands occasionally reaching for one or the other, his presence connecting them.

"The workshop will be functional soon," Sheldon said. "A few more steps—cleaning, equipment, final preparations. Then customers can begin to visit."

"Have you considered how to announce your availability?" Katsuhito asked.

"I had not thought that far. Word of mouth, perhaps? The village seems to communicate efficiently through informal channels."

"It does. But a more formal announcement might help. A sign, perhaps, or an introduction at the village association meeting."

"There is a village association?"

"Monthly meetings, primarily for administrative matters but also for community news. New businesses are often introduced there. The members include most of the village's established residents—merchants, farmers, craftsmen, professionals. If they know of your services, they will spread the word."

"I could arrange for you to attend, if you wish," Katsuhito continued. "The next meeting is in two weeks—convenient timing, if your shop is ready by then."

"I would appreciate that. Integration into the community continues to be important."

"It is essential. A repair shop serves the village; the village must know it exists. Without awareness, there can be no customers."

"The shrine gives me some introduction already. People know I am associated with the Masaki household."

"They do. But association is different from profession. They know you exist; they do not yet know what you offer. The announcement clarifies your role."

Tenchi listened to this exchange with partial attention, his focus occasionally drifting to the passing scenery. The evening was beautiful—birds returning to roosts, the first hints of stars appearing in the darkening east, the world settling toward nighttime peace.

"Will you have a sign?" he asked. "With your name on it?"

"Possibly. A sign helps people find the location."

"What will it say?"

"Something simple. 'Tsukino Repairs,' perhaps. Or simply 'Repair Shop.' The description matters less than the visibility."

"I think 'Tsukino Repairs' sounds official. Like a real business."

"It will be a real business. The sign merely announces what already exists."

"Can I help make the sign? I'm good at drawing. Maybe I could do the characters."

"Your calligraphy is still developing," Katsuhito observed. "A business sign requires a certain level of skill."

"I could practice first. Get really good, and then do the sign."

"That is a reasonable approach. Practice until the skill matches the requirement."

"How long would that take?"

"For professional-quality calligraphy? Several years of dedicated practice. For acceptable signage? Perhaps months, with focused effort."

Tenchi's enthusiasm dampened slightly at this timeline, but he nodded acceptance. "Maybe I can help with something else then. Something that doesn't need as much practice."

"There will be many tasks that need assistance. We will find appropriate roles for you."

The shrine appeared through the trees, its familiar gates and paths welcoming in the evening light. The return felt like homecoming—not just to a physical location, but to a pattern of life that had become comfortable and meaningful.

---

Dinner was a celebration of completion.

The clearing was done—the workshop stood empty and ready, the debris sorted and disposed, the space transformed from chaos to potential. Katsuhito had prepared a special meal to mark the occasion, more elaborate than the everyday fare. The aromas filled the kitchen as they gathered—grilled fish with careful seasoning, vegetables in a sauce that spoke of hours of preparation, rice with additions that elevated it from staple to celebration.

"To the completion of clearing," he said, raising his tea cup in a mock toast. "And to the work that continues."

"To continuation," Sheldon agreed.

"To helping!" Tenchi added, raising his own cup enthusiastically, some tea sloshing over the rim in his excitement.

The meal was eaten with good appetite, the physical labor having created genuine hunger. Both Tenchi and Sheldon reached for second helpings, their bodies demanding fuel to replace what had been expended. Conversation ranged across the day's work and the plans ahead—the cleaning that remained, the equipment that would be needed, the timeline for opening.

"We found really interesting things," Tenchi reported between bites. "Samples of wood finishes with labels on them. And a notebook with drawings of furniture. And a tool that we think was for a drill."

"You think?" Katsuhito asked.

"Tenchi figured it out," Sheldon said. "He observed the gear ratios and suggested it might be for converting slow rotation to fast rotation, like a drill mechanism."

Tenchi ducked his head, pleased by the acknowledgment. "I was just guessing."

"An informed guess based on evidence. That is reasoning, not mere speculation."

"How long before you can accept customers?" Katsuhito asked, steering the conversation to practical matters.

"Perhaps two weeks? The space needs cleaning and basic equipment. A workbench is essential, storage for tools and materials, adequate lighting. Once these are in place, simple repairs could begin."

"Two weeks is soon."

"I am motivated to begin earning. The community has invested in my preparation; I wish to return value as quickly as possible."

"Admirable motivation. But do not rush to the point of compromising quality. A reputation, once damaged, is difficult to repair."

"I will be careful. Only accepting work I am confident I can complete well, referring more complex tasks to others until my skills develop."

"A wise approach. Tanaka-san built his reputation through exactly this method—doing excellent work within his capabilities, honestly declining what exceeded them. Over decades, his capabilities expanded, but his reputation for reliability remained constant."

"He has mentioned similar principles. The consistency of quality, the importance of honest assessment."

"The lessons are universal. Every craft requires the same fundamental approach—competence, honesty, steady improvement. The specific skills differ, but the underlying philosophy remains constant."

Tenchi had been following the conversation, his attention sharp despite the late hour. "Will I be your first customer?"

"You do not have anything that needs repair."

"I could break something," he offered helpfully. "Then you could fix it."

"That would be counterproductive. The goal is to fix things that are already broken, not to create new damage."

"I know. I was joking." His grin confirmed this. "But seriously, will you let me know when you fix your first real thing? I want to see."

"I will let you know. Your interest in the work is appreciated."

"Maybe I can be there when you do your first repair. Like a witness."

"A witness?"

"To mark the occasion. The first repair in the new shop. It should be remembered."

"That is thoughtful. If circumstances permit, you may be present for the first repair."

Tenchi's smile brightened. "I'll be there. I promise."

---

Bedtime came with the pleasant exhaustion of productive labor.

Tenchi was tired—genuinely fatigued from a full day of physical work. His movements were slow as he prepared for bed, his yawns frequent and deep. Hikaru had already claimed his position at the foot of the futon, the kitten's routine undisturbed by the humans' late arrival. The room was warm with the day's accumulated heat, the windows open to admit the cooling evening air.

"Today was good," Tenchi murmured, as Sheldon adjusted the blankets. "A really good day."

"It was. Productive work, shared with good company."

"I liked helping. Not just being there, but actually helping. Like I was part of something important."

"Your contribution was genuine. The work went faster with your assistance, and your questions improved my thinking."

"Really?"

"Really. Sometimes explaining to another person clarifies one's own understanding. Your questions forced me to articulate things I had not consciously considered."

"Like what?"

"Like why the gear ratios in that mechanism suggested a drill. I knew intuitively that the proportions indicated speed multiplication, but I had not put it into words until you asked. The explanation helped me understand my own reasoning."

"So teaching helps the teacher too?"

"It does. Teaching and learning are not separate activities—they are intertwined. The teacher learns by teaching; the student teaches by learning."

"That's confusing but kind of makes sense."

"Many true things are like that. They sound paradoxical but reveal deeper truth when examined."

Tenchi's eyes were closing, sleep claiming him despite the conversation. "Tsukino-san? I'm glad the workshop is ready. It means you're really staying."

"I was always really staying."

"I know. But now there's... evidence. A place you're building. A future you're planning for. It makes it more real."

"The commitment was real from the beginning. But I understand what you mean. Physical manifestation makes abstract intention tangible."

"Yeah. That." His voice was slowing, growing softer. "Before, it was just words. 'I'm staying.' Words are easy. But building something—making a place—that's harder. That's proof."

"You are wise to distinguish between words and actions. Many people say things they do not mean; fewer follow through with effort."

"Have you ever... not followed through? Said you'd do something and then didn't?"

The question was innocent but touched something deeper. In his previous life, Sheldon had made many commitments—to research, to institutions, to the abstract pursuit of knowledge. But personal commitments? Those had been rare and often neglected.

"In my previous life, I was better at professional commitments than personal ones. I honored my obligations to work but sometimes neglected obligations to people."

"Why?"

"I valued the work more. Or I thought I did. Looking back, I believe I was simply more comfortable with abstract commitment than with human connection. The work never needed me in the way people did."

"That sounds lonely."

"It was lonely. I did not recognize it at the time, but yes—it was very lonely."

"You're not like that now."

"I am trying not to be. The commitment to you, to this household, to this community—these are personal commitments. They require sustained attention to people, not just to tasks."

"And you're following through. With the workshop. With me."

"I am following through. Every day, I try to honor what I have promised."

Tenchi's eyes closed fully. "That's good. That's really good." His voice was barely a whisper now. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight, Tenchi. Sleep well."

He sat for a moment longer, watching the peaceful face, feeling the weight of the commitments he had made. The boy trusted him completely—a trust that had been earned through consistent action, through following through on promises. The responsibility was profound, but it was also clarifying. He knew what mattered now in a way he had never known before.

He rose quietly and left the room.

---

On the engawa, the stars were brilliant.

Twenty-seven days. The workshop clearing complete, the space ready for its next transformation. Tenchi's observation lingered in Sheldon's mind—the physical evidence making intention tangible, the building of a future making the commitment real.

Katsuhito joined him, the evening ritual now automatic for both of them. The old man settled into his place with the comfortable movements of routine.

"He worked well today," Katsuhito observed. "Genuinely contributed."

"He did. His stamina surprised me—a full day of physical labor, and he remained focused throughout."

"He wanted to prove himself capable. Children often exceed their normal limits when motivated by a desire to demonstrate worth."

"Is that healthy?"

"In moderation. The desire to be useful, to contribute meaningfully—this is a positive impulse. It becomes problematic only when it tips into compulsion, when self-worth becomes entirely dependent on productivity."

"I will watch for that balance."

"You already do. Your praise was measured, your acknowledgment genuine. You valued his contribution without inflating it."

"I tried to be honest. Excessive praise teaches nothing; honest feedback teaches much."

"A philosophy we share." Katsuhito looked up at the stars. "Tomorrow is the last day of April. Four weeks complete."

"Nearly four weeks. The month ends tomorrow?"

"April has thirty days. Tomorrow is the thirtieth—the final day."

"Time has passed strangely. The days feel full, the weeks somehow short."

"Time expands to fill engaged attention. When we are absorbed in meaningful activity, the hours pass without marking themselves. Only in reflection do we notice how much has accumulated."

"Four weeks. A month since I arrived."

"And much has changed in that month. You have found a place, begun a purpose, developed relationships that will sustain you. The foundation is laid."

"It does not feel complete."

"It is not complete. Foundation is not structure, and structure is not home. But you have begun well. The rest will follow."

They sat in comfortable silence, the stars wheeling slowly overhead. The night was peaceful, the work of the day settled into memory, the work of tomorrow waiting patiently.

Twenty-seven days down. The building continued.

⁂

## Day 28

## Sunday, April 30, 1989 — Milestone

The last day of April arrived with the particular quality of spring mornings that Sheldon was beginning to recognize as characteristic of this mountain region—clear air carrying the scent of new growth, birdsong establishing territories in the forest, the landscape holding itself in that brief moment between the softness of early spring and the fullness that would follow. One month. Today marked exactly thirty days since a short Black man with three doctoral degrees and no survival instincts had stepped off a bus into a world that should not exist.

Sheldon stood on the engawa with his morning coffee, watching the sunrise paint the shrine grounds in gradients of gold and rose. The warmth in his chest pulsed gently, synchronized with his heartbeat—a sensation that had become so familiar over the past month that he sometimes forgot it was unusual. The shrine looked different now than it had on that first morning. Not physically changed, but perceived differently. He knew the rhythm of shadows across the courtyard throughout the day, the spots where morning sun lingered longest, the particular creaks of wooden boards that signaled someone approaching. A month ago, this had been a strange place. Now it was home.

The transformation still startled him when he allowed himself to consider it directly.

Tenchi emerged onto the engawa still rubbing sleep from his eyes, drawn by the smell of breakfast preparation. Sunday meant no school, which meant the boy had allowed himself to sleep slightly later—though "later" by Tenchi's standards still seemed remarkably early compared to the rhythms Sheldon remembered from his previous life.

"Good morning," Sheldon said. "Did you sleep well?"

"I dreamed about the workshop," Tenchi reported, settling onto the engawa beside him. "In the dream, it was already full of tools and projects. There were things on every surface, and people kept coming in asking for repairs. It was very busy."

"Busy dreams can indicate anticipation. Your mind processing possibilities."

"Is that how dreams work?"

"That is one theory. Dreams remain poorly understood even by those who study them professionally. But they often seem to reflect what occupies our waking thoughts." Sheldon considered the sunrise. "The workshop has been occupying many of my thoughts as well. Today we should clean and prepare the space for actual use."

"Real cleaning," Tenchi said, understanding the distinction. "Not just clearing things out, but making it ready."

"Precisely. The clearing removed what did not belong. The cleaning prepares what remains for purpose."

Breakfast was simple—rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, the small dried fish that Tenchi had learned to eat without complaint over the past month. Katsuhito joined them at the table, moving with his characteristic measured grace.

"The last day of April," the priest observed, settling into his customary position. "A significant transition."

"Sheldon-san has been here a whole month," Tenchi announced, as if this required formal acknowledgment. "Thirty days."

"Twenty-eight days since your arrival at the shrine," Katsuhito corrected gently. "Two additional days of travel and orientation before that. But yes—approximately one month since you entered this region."

Sheldon nodded. The counting had different starting points depending on what one measured. Day One of his documented existence in this reality versus his first day actually residing at the shrine. Both were valid anchors.

"How does the time seem to you?" Katsuhito asked. "Long or short?"

The question deserved honest consideration. "Both," Sheldon admitted. "The individual days have felt full—each one containing more experience than I would have thought possible. But when I consider the entire month as a unit, it seems impossibly brief. As if I arrived only recently, yet also as if I have been here much longer."

"Time expands and contracts according to attention and engagement," Katsuhito said. "The person who lives fully experiences more time than the calendar indicates. The person who merely exists experiences less."

"I have been living fully," Sheldon agreed. "More fully than I lived in many years of my previous existence."

Tenchi looked between them, processing this exchange. "Is that why vacation always feels shorter than school? Because you're paying more attention during vacation?"

"An astute observation," Katsuhito confirmed. "Routine creates a kind of temporal compression. The mind stops recording individual moments when they become too similar to previous ones. Novel experience restores the sensation of time's passage."

"So Sheldon-san's month felt long because everything was new?"

"Everything was new," Sheldon confirmed. "The language, the culture, the daily rhythms, the relationships. Each day contained discoveries I had not anticipated. And each day built upon previous discoveries in ways that created additional complexity."

"Will it start feeling shorter?" Tenchi asked, suddenly concerned. "As things stop being new?"

"Some things will become familiar," Sheldon acknowledged. "But I suspect this household generates enough novelty to prevent excessive compression. Your grandfather alone provides sufficient philosophical complexity to occupy attention indefinitely."

Katsuhito's expression suggested mild amusement. "I will endeavor to maintain my complexity."

---

The workshop waited in the morning light, empty now of debris but not yet ready for use. Dust coated every surface—the accumulation of years, stirred by yesterday's clearing but not yet removed. Cobwebs traced delicate patterns in corners and along ceiling joists. The wooden floor, solid and intact, was gray with grime that obscured its actual color.

Sheldon assessed the space with cleaning rather than archaeological eyes. Yesterday's sorting had been about evaluation and decision-making. Today's work was about transformation—converting a cleared space into a functional one.

"We will need water," he said, surveying the scope of the task. "Multiple buckets. Clean rags. A stiff broom for the initial sweeping. A softer broom for detail work afterward."

"I can carry water," Tenchi offered immediately. "The well isn't far."

"Multiple trips will be required. The floor alone will need considerable attention."

They established a supply chain—Tenchi ferrying buckets from the well while Sheldon began the systematic removal of surface dust. The work was straightforward but thorough, requiring attention to sequence and method. Ceiling first, to prevent re-soiling cleaned lower surfaces. Then walls. Then the window frame, which would eventually hold glass but for now simply provided an opening to the outside. Finally the floor, working from the back corner toward the door.

The broom raised clouds of dust that caught the light streaming through the window opening. Sheldon wrapped a cloth around his nose and mouth, a precaution his previous life's laboratory experience had instilled. Tenchi, observing this, improvised a similar arrangement from a spare cleaning rag.

"The dust is very thick," the boy observed, his voice muffled by the cloth.

"Decades of accumulation. Each year added its layer. We are removing all of them simultaneously."

"Like archaeology again? But backward—taking things away instead of finding them?"

"An interesting parallel. Yes, in a sense we are excavating the floor's true surface from beneath its accumulated coating."

The sweeping took nearly an hour, working methodically across every surface. When they finished, the air had cleared somewhat, and the true character of the space began to emerge. The walls, freed from their dust coating, revealed weathered wood in varying shades of brown and gray. The floor showed boards darker than Sheldon had expected—old wood, seasoned by decades of use, its surface worn smooth in paths that traced previous patterns of movement.

"Someone walked here many times," Tenchi said, noticing the same worn paths. "You can see where they stepped the most."

"Traffic patterns preserved in the wood itself. The body remembers its movements, and the floor remembers receiving them."

"Tsukino-san, you mean? The man who worked here before?"

"Likely him, and perhaps his father before him, and whoever established the workshop initially. Generations of footsteps, all contributing to the same worn channels."

Tenchi considered this, then deliberately stepped into one of the worn paths, placing his feet where countless previous feet had fallen. "I'm walking where they walked."

"You are. And now your footsteps join theirs, however briefly."

"Will my footsteps wear the floor too? Eventually?"

"If you walk here often enough, over many years, yes. The cumulative effect of small forces repeated countless times. Though the floor would need to survive considerably longer than most buildings do."

The mopping phase followed—Tenchi hauling fresh water while Sheldon worked across the floor with rags, changing the water frequently as it turned gray with extracted dirt. The physical labor was demanding, requiring sustained attention to ensure complete coverage. By the time they finished, both of them were damp with exertion despite the cool morning air.

But the floor gleamed with its first true cleaning in decades. The wood was indeed dark—cherry, Sheldon suspected, chosen for its durability and workability. The boards fit tightly together, their joinery still sound after all these years. The wear patterns were more visible now, pale streaks where feet had polished the surface smooth.

"It is beautiful," Tenchi said, regarding the transformed floor with evident satisfaction. "I did not expect it to be beautiful."

"Many things become beautiful when properly revealed. The beauty was always present, obscured by what accumulated on top of it."

"Like the room itself. It was always this room, just hidden."

"Yes. Our work has been removal and revelation, not creation. We have not built anything. We have simply allowed what existed to become visible."

Katsuhito appeared in the doorway, surveying their progress with quiet approval. He had brought tea and small rice balls, recognizing that the workers would need sustenance.

"The floor shows its age well," he observed, stepping carefully onto the newly cleaned surface. "Cherry wood, from the color. Likely harvested locally—there are old cherry groves on the mountain that have supplied timber for generations."

"Is that wood expensive?" Tenchi asked, accepting a rice ball gratefully.

"Cherry is valued for certain applications. For flooring, it is perhaps excessive—pine would serve the practical purpose equally well. But Tsukino-san's father, who likely installed this floor, was a craftsman. He would have appreciated working on beautiful materials."

"So he made the floor beautiful because he valued beauty, not because it was necessary?"

"Many choices in traditional craft reflect values beyond pure function. The floor serves its purpose—providing a surface to walk and work upon. The choice of cherry over pine serves a different purpose—demonstrating care, attention, respect for the space and for those who would use it."

Sheldon considered this as he drank his tea. The distinction resonated with something in his own approach to work. In his previous life, he had often chosen elegant solutions over merely functional ones, not because elegance was required but because it mattered to him. The difference between adequate and excellent had always seemed worth the additional effort, even when no one else would notice.

"I understand that impulse," he said. "The desire to exceed minimum requirements even when exceeding them provides no material benefit."

"It provides benefit to the craftsman," Katsuhito replied. "The knowledge that one's work reflects one's full capability rather than merely what was demanded. That knowledge has value, even if it cannot be measured in practical terms."

---

The afternoon brought the next phase—assessment and planning. With the space clean, its true dimensions and possibilities became clear. Sheldon paced the room methodically, noting measurements and considering arrangements.

The workshop was larger than it had seemed when filled with debris—perhaps eight meters by six, with ceiling height sufficient for comfortable standing throughout. The window opening faced east-south, as Katsuhito had noted yesterday, which would provide excellent morning light for detailed work. The floor was level, the walls sound, the structure fundamentally solid despite its years of neglect.

"The workbench should go against the north wall," Sheldon said, thinking aloud. "That provides stable light from the window without direct sun falling on the work surface. Direct sun creates glare and causes uneven heating of materials."

"Where did Tsukino-san have his workbench?" Tenchi asked.

"The wear patterns suggest the north wall, actually. The heaviest traffic flows from the door to that area and back. He likely reached the same conclusion about light placement."

"So you would put things where they were before?"

"Where practical considerations suggest they should be. The fact that previous occupants reached similar conclusions suggests those conclusions are sound."

They discussed placement possibilities—where tool storage might go, where finished projects could await collection, where raw materials might be kept. The space demanded organization, a system that would support efficient work flow while keeping necessary items accessible.

"In my previous workplace," Sheldon said, "I learned that arrangement affects thought. A cluttered space promotes scattered attention. An organized space promotes clarity."

"Was your previous workplace organized?"

"My personal workspace was meticulously organized. The larger laboratory was more chaotic, subject to the preferences of many individuals with different organizational philosophies. I had a desk that colleagues considered excessively neat."

"Excessively?"

"They believed that a certain amount of creative disorder indicated active thinking. I believed that disorder simply indicated disorder, and that active thinking could occur equally well in organized environments. We did not resolve this philosophical difference."

"Grandfather's spaces are very organized," Tenchi observed. "The shrine, the storage areas, his room. Everything has its place."

"Order reflects and reinforces mental discipline. A practice common to many contemplative traditions. The external arrangement mirrors and supports the internal state."

"So organizing the workshop is also organizing your thoughts?"

"In a sense. Creating a space for work creates mental space for the work itself. The physical preparation is also psychological preparation."

They marked potential locations with small stones—here for the workbench, there for tool storage, along that wall for shelving. The placement was tentative, subject to revision once actual furniture and fixtures existed, but it provided a framework for future decisions.

"We will need to acquire or build the actual fixtures," Sheldon said, surveying their stone markers. "The workbench itself, the shelving, the storage systems. Some can be constructed from available materials. Others may need to be purchased or commissioned."

"Tanaka-san could help," Tenchi suggested. "He knows about tools and workshops."

"He has offered his assistance, yes. His knowledge of local resources and traditional construction methods will be valuable."

The walk home took them through late afternoon light that painted the forest path in amber and gold. The day's physical labor had left Sheldon pleasantly tired—the honest exhaustion of useful work rather than the hollow fatigue of unproductive effort.

"One month," Tenchi said, returning to the morning's observation. "Do you feel different than when you arrived?"

The question required genuine reflection. "Yes," Sheldon admitted. "Though the differences are difficult to articulate precisely. I am more settled than I was. More connected to this place and the people in it. Less uncertain about belonging."

"You were uncertain before?"

"Very uncertain. I arrived as a stranger in every possible sense. A foreigner in an unfamiliar country, a newcomer in an established household, a person whose previous life had not prepared him for anything he would encounter here."

"But you learned quickly. Grandfather says you adapted faster than he expected."

"Necessity accelerates learning. And the household—you, your grandfather—made adaptation possible through patience and acceptance."

Tenchi considered this as they walked. "I don't remember you being uncertain. You seemed confident from the beginning."

"Competence often masks uncertainty. I knew how to function—how to work, how to communicate adequately, how to perform necessary tasks. That competence was genuine. But underneath it, I was unsure whether I would be allowed to remain. Whether I could truly belong rather than merely being tolerated."

"You belong now," Tenchi said with quiet certainty. "You're family."

The simple statement carried weight that its brevity did not suggest. Family. The word had meant something different in Sheldon's previous life—biological connections, inherited obligations, relationships defined by circumstance rather than choice. Here, the word meant something chosen, something built through daily presence and accumulated trust.

"I am family," Sheldon agreed. "The belonging developed gradually, through consistent presence and demonstrated reliability. But at some point—I cannot identify exactly when—the uncertainty resolved. The possibility of not belonging became inconceivable."

"Maybe around the two-week mark," Tenchi suggested. "That's when you started seeming more relaxed. At breakfast especially. Before that you always sat very straight, like you were ready to leave quickly if needed."

The observation was startlingly accurate. Sheldon had not noticed the shift in his own posture, but Tenchi was right—his body had known he belonged before his mind fully accepted it.

"You are remarkably observant," Sheldon said. "Most people do not notice changes in others' posture over time."

"I notice things about people I care about. It's automatic."

"That is a valuable ability. It allows you to understand others' states without requiring them to articulate those states directly."

"Sometimes people don't know how they feel. Their bodies know before their minds do."

"Your grandfather has mentioned something similar. The body's wisdom preceding conscious understanding."

"He talks about that during training sometimes. How your body can learn things that your thinking mind hasn't figured out yet."

---

Dinner conversation turned to the broader milestone—not just Sheldon's month of presence, but the household's month of adjustment.

"The integration has proceeded well," Katsuhito observed. "Better than I anticipated, though I have learned not to make confident predictions about such things."

"You had concerns initially?" Sheldon asked.

"Practical concerns, not personal ones. The addition of an adult presence changes household dynamics in complex ways. Even well-intentioned additions can disrupt established patterns. I was uncertain how Tenchi would respond to shared attention, how I would respond to shared responsibility, how you would respond to the constraints of rural communal living."

"What changed your uncertainty?"

"Observation of actual behavior. You demonstrated consistent thoughtfulness in your interactions. You respected existing patterns while introducing improvements. You prioritized Tenchi's wellbeing over your own convenience. These were not things I could have predicted from initial impressions, but they became clear over the first weeks."

"The tatami room was good evidence," Tenchi added. "The work took a long time and you did it carefully even when it was hard or boring."

"Sustained effort reveals character more reliably than brief encounters," Katsuhito agreed. "Anyone can appear virtuous for an hour. Appearing virtuous for weeks requires either genuine virtue or exceptional deception."

"And you concluded I was not exceptionally deceptive?"

"I concluded that no one maintains that quality of careful attention while deceiving. Deception requires mental resources that would compromise the work itself. Your attention was fully present, which indicated your character was also fully present."

The assessment was flattering but also slightly uncomfortable. Sheldon had not been consciously demonstrating character—he had simply been doing work in the way that seemed correct. That his behavior served as evidence for evaluation had not occurred to him at the time.

"I was not performing virtue," he said. "I was simply working as I believe work should be done."

"Which is precisely why the demonstration was credible. Performed virtue has a particular quality that genuine virtue lacks. You exhibited the genuine variety."

---

The evening brought another first—Sheldon's first monthly reflection in this new life. He sat on the engawa after Tenchi had gone to bed, watching stars emerge in the darkening sky, considering the distance traveled in thirty days.

He had arrived with nothing but a duffel bag and the profound disorientation of a man whose entire existence had been upended. He had expected, at best, to survive—to find some minimal foothold in a world that should not exist, to endure until circumstances revealed whether his situation was permanent or temporary.

Instead, he had found purpose. The repair work, the teaching, the caregiving—each had provided meaning that his previous life's academic achievements had never quite delivered. He had published papers and earned degrees and built a professional reputation, but none of it had felt like this. None of it had connected him to other people in ways that mattered beyond professional acknowledgment.

The warmth in his chest pulsed gently, its presence now so familiar that he sometimes forgot it was unusual. The enhancement was real—he could feel its subtle influence on his cognition, his stamina, his sensory acuity. But it was also quiet, integrated, not the dramatic power display he might have expected from cosmic intervention. Whatever Cosmos had given him, it was meant to support rather than to overwhelm.

One month. The time felt simultaneously brief and expansive, as he had described at breakfast. Brief because the calendar showed only thirty days. Expansive because those thirty days had contained more significant moments than years of his previous existence.

He thought about his previous life's isolation—the admission he had made to Tenchi the night before. He had honored professional commitments while neglecting personal ones, valuing abstract work over human connection. The loneliness had been invisible to him at the time, so thoroughly normalized that he had not recognized it as loneliness. He had assumed that solitude was simply how intelligent people lived, that connection was a luxury he did not need.

He had been wrong. The past month had demonstrated exactly how wrong.

The connections here—with Tenchi, with Katsuhito, with Tanaka and the emerging village relationships—filled something that had been empty before. The filling was so complete that he could now perceive, by contrast, how profound the emptiness had been.

"May approaches," Katsuhito said, appearing on the engawa with his characteristic quiet. The priest settled beside Sheldon, arranging himself in meditation posture facing the darkening garden.

"A new month. The second month of this life."

"How do you anticipate it?"

Sheldon considered the question. "With more confidence than I anticipated the first month. I know the rhythms now, the expectations, the patterns of daily life. The uncertainty of complete novelty has resolved into the manageable uncertainty of ongoing experience."

"You have established foundation. Now you build upon it."

"The workshop represents that building. Converting space into function. Creating capacity for contribution."

"The community will welcome your contributions. Tanaka has spoken of you to others—your careful work, your thoughtful approach. Word spreads in villages. People form opinions based on accumulated reports."

"And the opinions are favorable?"

"They are curious, primarily. A foreigner who works well with his hands, who treats tools with respect, who teaches a child with patience—this is unusual enough to generate interest. Whether that interest becomes acceptance depends on continued demonstration."

"Which I intend to provide."

"I know." Katsuhito was quiet for a moment. "The month has been good for Tenchi as well. He is more confident than he was, more willing to engage with unfamiliar situations. Your presence has given him stability that allows growth."

"He has given me stability as well. The responsibility of caring for him provided focus when I might otherwise have been overwhelmed by circumstances."

"Mutual support is stronger than unidirectional support. You help him; he helps you. The relationship strengthens both parties."

"I did not expect to become a caregiver," Sheldon admitted. "In my previous life, I had no children, little experience with children, no particular desire to raise children. The role was not one I would have chosen."

"And now?"

"Now I cannot imagine having chosen differently. The role is central to who I am becoming. Sheldon Carter, caregiver. Sheldon Carter, teacher. These identities did not exist thirty days ago. Now they define more of my sense of self than all my previous professional accomplishments combined."

"Identity is not fixed. We become who our circumstances require us to be, and in becoming, we discover capacities we did not know we possessed."

"You speak from experience."

"I speak from centuries of experience. I have been many things in many contexts. The person I am here, now, is not the person I was elsewhere, before. Each role reveals different aspects of potential. Each context draws forth different capabilities."

Sheldon absorbed this. The priest rarely spoke so directly about his extended existence. The acknowledgment of "centuries" was more explicit than usual.

"Do you miss who you were before?"

"Sometimes. Nostalgia for previous selves is natural, I think. But the person I miss is also the person who led to who I am now. Missing him is in some sense missing a necessary stage in my own development."

"You view your past selves as developmental stages?"

"Something like that. Each version contained elements that would persist and elements that would change. The persistent elements form the core; the changing elements form the adaptation. Together they create continuity through transformation."

"I am in a transformation stage now."

"You are. The Sheldon Carter who arrived thirty days ago is already different from the Sheldon Carter sitting here tonight. The transformation will continue. Eventually, looking back, you will see this time as a distinct phase—the arrival phase, the foundation phase, whatever you choose to call it."

"And what comes after foundation?"

"Building. The slow accumulation of presence and contribution that converts residence into belonging. You have begun this process already. It will continue for years, deepening and elaborating until your place here is as settled as mine."

"Years," Sheldon repeated. The word had different weight now than it would have had a month ago. A month ago, years had seemed impossibly distant, beyond any reasonable planning horizon. Now years seemed like a natural timeframe—the scale on which meaningful things developed.

"Years are not so long when filled properly," Katsuhito said. "They pass, as all time passes. But they leave residue—relationships strengthened, skills developed, understanding deepened. The years to come will leave their residue on you as well."

"I hope the residue will be positive."

"That depends on the choices made within those years. You have demonstrated good judgment so far. I have no reason to expect that judgment to deteriorate."

They sat together in companionable silence as the stars brightened overhead. Somewhere in the forest, an owl called—the same owl Sheldon had heard on previous nights, its voice now familiar rather than strange. The mountain air carried the scent of spring growth, of life renewing itself after winter dormancy.

One month complete. Eleven more months until the year's end, and after that, years beyond counting. The scale of his new life stretched before him—not intimidating now, but inviting. A canvas large enough for whatever he might become.

"Thank you," Sheldon said finally. "For accepting my presence. For allowing me to become part of this household."

"Thanks are unnecessary for actions that benefit all parties. Your presence has improved our lives as well. The thanks, if any are owed, should flow in multiple directions."

"Then I will accept your thanks as well, for whatever contribution I have made."

"Accepted." Katsuhito rose with his characteristic fluid movement. "Sleep well, Sheldon-san. Tomorrow is the first day of May. A new month, a new phase. The workshop awaits its next transformation."

"And I await mine."

The priest smiled—a rare expression that transformed his usually austere features. "You understand. That is good. Understanding makes transformation easier, though never entirely comfortable."

He disappeared into the house, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the night sounds and the profound awareness of time passing, carrying him forward into whatever would come next.

One month complete. The foundation laid. The building could begin.
