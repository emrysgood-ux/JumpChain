## Background

**Airaian Origins:**
Born to House Magma, one of four noble houses on Airai. House Magma's philosophical tradition centers on Washu worship — scientific inquiry as divine practice.

**Marriage to Yosho:**
After Kasumi's death in the late 1800s, Yosho eventually remarried. Airi represented a connection to the wider galaxy while respecting his exile.

**The Death Script:**
When Kiyone knew she was dying, Airi helped her write the "morbidly humorous script" for explaining death to Tenchi. This dark comedy was peak Airi-Kiyone collaboration.

## Phase I Constraints

⚠️ **FORBIDDEN:** Airi cannot appear directly in Phase I (1989-1992). Her name, position, and Airaian/GP references are forbidden in Sheldon's POV.

**Background Presence:**
- Her intelligence networks monitor Earth
- Minaho reports to her about Tenchi
- She grieves Kiyone from afar
- She and Seto maintain the "death script" deception

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **Phase III:** When Airi eventually appears, she will recognize Sheldon's importance to her grandson immediately. Her first reaction: "So THIS is who has been raising my grandson."

🔮 **DYNAMIC:** Airi represents the "professional grandmother" — competent, connected, but absent. Sheldon has been the present caregiver she couldn't be.
