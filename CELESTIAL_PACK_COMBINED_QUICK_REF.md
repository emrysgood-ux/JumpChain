## Philosophy

> **"Have the skill and not need it instead of need the skill and not have it."**

- NOT power fantasy - intelligent preparedness
- Slice-of-Life MEETS Space Opera
- Combat skills valid (prefers peace, fights when needed)
- Magical utility encouraged (healing, food, crafting)
- Funny/interesting perks add character
