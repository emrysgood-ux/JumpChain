# DAY 4 — FIRST DAY OF LABOR
## April 6, 1989 (Thursday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Main House → Tsukino House (work site) → Main House  
**Weather:** Clear, 18°C high, 8°C low, light morning breeze  
**Sunrise:** 5:49 AM | **Sunset:** 6:28 PM

---

## SCENE 1: PRE-DAWN WAKING
**Time:** 05:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

He woke before the uguisu.

The bedroom darkness remained complete—no gray light yet filtering through the shoji, no sounds suggesting the mountain had acknowledged morning. But his body had roused itself with the certainty of someone who had set a mental alarm, and the alarm had fired precisely.

Work begins at six. Yamada had been clear. Sheldon intended to be ready before the carpenter arrived.

The futon folded itself away with motions that had become automatic. Four nights. His hands knew the creases, the compression, the sequence that produced a bundle small enough for the oshiire closet. Small competencies. Building toward larger ones.

---

## SCENE 2: WORK CLOTHES
**Time:** 05:22:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The work clothes waited where he'd left them.

Nobuyuki's old garments—the ones Katsuhito had provided on Day 2—had become his uniform for this life. Heavy pants with reinforced knees, worn but solid. The faded blue shirt that felt rough against his skin, functional rather than comfortable. He tied on the headband, a strip of cloth to keep sweat from eyes during labor.

Sheldon dressed with attention to each detail. The pants rode slightly high but stayed in place. The shirt was loose through the shoulders in ways that would help rather than hinder during physical work.

He looked like a Japanese laborer from fifty years earlier. The anachronism seemed appropriate.

---

## SCENE 3: EARLY KITCHEN
**Time:** 05:35:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

No time for a real meal, but his body required fuel.

The kitchen had been cleaned during yesterday's efforts, surfaces now visible beneath their former dust. The gas stove worked—tested and approved—and a small pot of water came to boil while Sheldon measured rice that had been stored in a container older than he felt.

Onigiri. Rice balls. The simplest breakfast, portable and dense with energy. Dorothy Mae had made something similar on mornings when work couldn't wait for proper meals—hand-formed balls of grain, carried in pockets, consumed between tasks.

He formed three, his hands finding the pressure and moisture balance through instinct rather than instruction. Salt on the outside. Nothing fancy. Fuel, not cuisine.

---

## SCENE 4: SUNRISE OBSERVATION
**Time:** 05:48:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The uguisu announced dawn as he stepped outside.

*Ho-hokekyo*. The three-note call, precisely timed to the first visible light on the eastern horizon. The mountain knew this rhythm, had known it for millennia before humans built shrines on its slopes.

Sheldon ate one onigiri standing on the engawa, watching the sunrise paint colors across clouds that would burn off within the hour. The day would be clear—Tenchi's frogs had been right again, apparently. Good weather for roof work.

A figure moved on the path below. Yamada, arriving early, carrying what appeared to be a bundle of tools. The carpenter walked with the same deliberate efficiency Sheldon had observed yesterday, his pace unhurried but covering ground steadily.

Time to begin.

---

## SCENE 5: YAMADA'S ARRIVAL
**Time:** 05:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, path

"You're awake." Yamada's tone carried neither approval nor disapproval—simple observation.

"You said six. I assumed you meant it."

"Most people hear six and arrive at six-fifteen, expecting me to wait." The carpenter set down his bundle near the house's foundation. "You'll learn faster than they would have."

The compliment—if it was one—arrived without emphasis. Yamada began unpacking his tools: a hammer with a head worn smooth by decades of use, a measuring stick marked in traditional units, a saw whose teeth still caught the early light with precision.

"First lesson," Yamada said. "Respect the tools. They've been doing this work longer than you've been alive."

---

## SCENE 6: TOOL INTRODUCTION
**Time:** 06:05:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, work area

Each tool had a name.

Yamada introduced them with the formality of human introductions—this is the genno (hammer), this is the nokogiri (saw), this is the sumisashi (ink line). The carpenter's hands touched each implement with visible care, positioning them on the groundcloth in the order they would be needed.

"The foreigner's approach," Yamada said, "is to buy tools when you need them and discard them when they break. The Japanese approach—the correct approach—is to maintain tools so they never break."

"How old is that hammer?"

"My father made it. He was seventy when he gave it to me. I was twenty." A pause. "Do the mathematics."

Over a century. The hammer had been shaping wood before anyone alive today was born. Sheldon adjusted his understanding of the day's instruction—this wasn't just about roof repair. This was about philosophy embedded in practice.

---

## SCENE 7: LADDER WORK
**Time:** 06:25:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

The ladder went up first.

Yamada supervised while Sheldon did the lifting. The telescoping ladder from yesterday extended to its full height, stabilized at the base with wooden blocks the carpenter had brought, secured at the top with rope looped around a rafter end that protruded through the eave.

"Pull on it," Yamada instructed.

Sheldon pulled. The ladder didn't move.

"Harder."

He pulled with genuine force, body weight committed. The ladder creaked but held.

"Good. Now you can trust it." Yamada began climbing. "Come up when I call."

---

## SCENE 8: ROOF ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 06:40:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof surface

The roof felt different from yesterday's brief visit.

Not just visually different—physically different, the tiles' texture registering through his work shoes, the slope demanding constant awareness of weight distribution. Yamada moved across the surface with the confidence of someone who'd spent decades at elevation. Sheldon followed more cautiously, testing each step before committing.

"Stay on the cross-beams beneath," Yamada said. "The tiles will support you, but the beams are certain. Certainty matters when you're three stories up."

Three stories. Sheldon hadn't considered the height in those terms. The Tsukino house looked modest from ground level, but the roof peak sat well above the surrounding trees. A fall would be serious.

"I understand."

"You understand the words. Understanding the reality takes longer."

---

## SCENE 9: TILE REMOVAL INSTRUCTION
**Time:** 07:00:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

"We start at the top and work down."

Yamada positioned himself at the ridge line, where the northwest section's tiles met the central peak. His hands demonstrated the removal technique—lifting from the lower edge, pivoting at the nail point, sliding the tile free without damaging its neighbors.

"The tiles interlock. Each one holds its neighbors in place, and they hold it. Remove them out of sequence and you create cascading failure."

"Like dominoes."

"Like systems." Yamada's glance suggested approval. "Everything connects to everything else. The roof, the walls, the foundation, the ground beneath. Change one element and the effects propagate."

The principle resonated with physics Sheldon knew—conservation laws, equilibrium states, the interconnected web of cause and effect. House repair and particle physics shared common foundations.

---

## SCENE 10: FIRST TILE REMOVAL
**Time:** 07:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

His hands touched the first tile.

Clay, fired to stone hardness generations ago. The surface held the texture of its making—fingerprints, perhaps, from the artisan who'd formed it. Or the marks of weather, decades of rain and sun and frost leaving their signatures in the material.

"Lift from here." Yamada indicated the lower edge. "Rock it gently. Feel where it catches."

Sheldon followed the instruction. The tile resisted, then gave—a nail beneath releasing its grip as the pivot point allowed. The tile came free in his hands, heavier than expected, still warm from the morning sun.

"Set it down carefully. We'll reuse what we can."

He descended the ladder to place the tile in the growing collection at the building's base. One tile. Perhaps two hundred to go.

---

## SCENE 11: ESTABLISHING RHYTHM
**Time:** 07:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

An hour produced thirty tiles.

The rhythm had established itself: climb, remove, descend, stack, repeat. Yamada supervised from above, correcting technique when Sheldon's approach deviated from optimal, but mostly allowing the work to teach itself.

"You're not breathing hard."

Sheldon paused mid-climb. "Should I be?"

"After an hour of ladder work? Most people would be." Yamada's assessment carried neither accusation nor concern—just observation. "You're stronger than you look."

"I don't know why."

"Does it matter?"

The question invited reflection. Did it matter? His body worked. His strength served the tasks required. The mechanism remained mysterious, but the function was clear.

"Not right now," Sheldon said. "It might matter later."

"That's the correct answer."

---

## SCENE 12: BREAKFAST BREAK
**Time:** 08:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Yamada called a halt for food.

The carpenter produced his own provisions—a bento box wrapped in cloth, contents arranged with the same precision he applied to everything. Rice, pickled vegetables, a small portion of fish. Simple and complete.

Sheldon offered his remaining onigiri. Yamada accepted one with a nod of thanks.

"You made these?"

"This morning."

"They're adequate." From Yamada, this was apparently high praise. "My wife says I can't taste anything unless it's been pickled for a week."

"Your wife is still living?"

"Forty-three years married." A pause. "She wanted to meet you. I told her to wait until you'd survived a day of work."

"Am I surviving?"

"So far. Ask again at sunset."

---

## SCENE 13: KATSUHITO'S VISIT
**Time:** 09:00:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, work area

The priest descended from the shrine during the morning hours.

Katsuhito appeared on the path carrying what proved to be tea—a thermos and cups, provisions for workers who hadn't thought to bring their own. His robes had been exchanged for simpler clothing, though something in his bearing still suggested ceremony.

"Progress," he observed, looking at the growing tile stack.

"Slow progress," Yamada corrected. "But acceptable for a first day."

"Higher praise than most receive."

"Most don't earn higher." Yamada accepted a cup of tea with visible gratitude. "The boy has good hands. Listens better than he talks. Could be worse."

Sheldon drank his own tea, letting the conversation flow around him. Katsuhito and Yamada shared the shorthand of old acquaintance, referencing events and people that required no explanation between them. He was the newcomer here, the variable being integrated into an established equation.

---

## SCENE 14: MID-MORNING WORK
**Time:** 09:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

The felt beneath the tiles told stories.

As each tile came away, the waterproof layer it had protected became visible. In some places, the felt remained intact—dark and solid, doing its job. In others, water damage had left marks: staining, softening, the early stages of deterioration that would accelerate if left untreated.

"Here." Yamada indicated a particularly damaged section. "This felt has failed. It's not protecting anything."

"How do you know the difference?"

"Touch." The carpenter pressed his fingers into both areas—sound and damaged. "Feel the difference in resistance. The healthy felt pushes back. The damaged felt surrenders."

Sheldon tried. The difference was subtle but present—a firmness versus a give, life versus death in roofing materials.

"I feel it."

"Good. Now you know what to look for everywhere else."

---

## SCENE 15: TENCHI'S VISIT
**Time:** 10:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, ground level

Tenchi arrived with his grandfather.

The child had apparently convinced Katsuhito that observing roof work was essential education. He stood at the base of the ladder, looking up with an expression of mixed fascination and concern.

"Sheldon-san, you're very high up!"

"I am." Sheldon paused in his descent. "The roof needs fixing."

"Are you scared?"

"A little. But Yamada-san knows what he's doing."

"Yamada-jii-san yelled at Papa once. Papa put a nail in wrong."

From above, Yamada's voice carried. "Your father used the wrong nail for the wood type. He learned."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied that the previous incident had resulted in appropriate education rather than mere criticism. He settled on a stone near the tile stack, prepared to watch.

"He can't stay long," Katsuhito said quietly to Sheldon. "But he wanted to see."

"He's welcome to watch."

---

## SCENE 16: RAFTER EXPOSURE
**Time:** 11:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

With fifty tiles removed, the damaged rafter became visible.

The wood showed its age in the morning light—darkened where water had penetrated, softened where rot had begun its slow consumption. The joint Sheldon had identified from the crawlspace looked worse from above: a gap where tight connection should exist, movement where stability was required.

Yamada examined it with hands and eyes, probing the wood's surface, testing its resistance.

"This rafter must be replaced. No question."

"How do we do that?"

"We don't. Not today." Yamada stood carefully, balancing on the exposed structure. "Today we clear the area. Tomorrow we reinforce what remains. The day after, we remove and replace."

The timeline stretched ahead: days of work, each with its specific tasks, each building toward the goal of a sound roof. Sheldon appreciated the systematic approach—problems solved in sequence, each solution enabling the next.

---

## SCENE 17: LUNCH
**Time:** 12:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The noon siren caught them mid-sandwich.

Katsuhito had provided lunch—more substantial than breakfast, recognizing that physical labor required physical fuel. Rice, fish, vegetables, miso soup that had somehow stayed warm in the thermos designed for tea.

"You eat like you haven't been fed in years," Yamada observed.

"I didn't know I was that hungry until the food arrived."

"Labor does that. Your body uses energy faster than your mind realizes. Eat until you're full, then eat a little more. You'll need it."

Sheldon followed the advice. The food disappeared with efficiency that surprised him—plate after plate, bowl after bowl, his appetite seemingly bottomless. The body that didn't tire also didn't seem to stop demanding fuel.

"I've never eaten this much before."

"You've never worked this hard before." Yamada shrugged. "The body knows what it needs. Trust it."

---

## SCENE 18: AFTERNOON INSTRUCTION
**Time:** 13:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, work area (ground level)

The afternoon shifted to theory.

Yamada led Sheldon through the tile collection, explaining the sorting criteria: tiles intact and reusable, tiles damaged but salvageable, tiles too compromised to serve. The evaluation required judgment developed over decades—cracks that mattered versus cracks that didn't, wear that weakened versus wear that was purely cosmetic.

"This one?" Sheldon held up a tile with hairline fractures.

"Reusable. The cracks are surface only—they haven't penetrated. Water won't pass."

"This one?"

"Compromised. See how the crack extends past the center line? That's structural. One hard freeze and it splits completely."

The distinctions were subtle but learnable. Sheldon filed each example, building the mental catalog that would eventually let him make such judgments independently.

---

## SCENE 19: SECONDARY RAFTER ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 14:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

Back up the ladder for afternoon work.

The area around the primary damage required examination now that tiles had been cleared. Yamada moved carefully across the exposed structure, testing each beam and board with the attention of a doctor examining a patient.

"The secondary rafters—these two here—show water damage but remain structurally sound."

"How can you tell?"

"I'm standing on them." Yamada shifted his weight deliberately. "If they were compromised, they would flex. They don't. The wood has absorbed moisture, discolored, begun to soften at the surface. But the core remains solid."

"What do we do with them?"

"Treat and seal. Chemical penetration to kill any rot that's started. Then a protective layer to prevent future water entry." He marked the boards with the carpenter's pencil. "This happens after the primary rafter is replaced. Sequence matters."

---

## SCENE 20: LATE AFTERNOON CLEARING
**Time:** 15:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof (northwest section)

The tile removal continued.

Eighty tiles now occupied the ground-level collection—sorted, evaluated, organized by fate. The cleared section of roof exposed more felt, more damage, more history of water doing what water did when barriers failed.

Sheldon's arms had begun to notice the work. Not pain, not yet, but a heaviness that suggested muscles tracking their usage. His body still performed without complaint, but complaints might come tomorrow.

"That's enough for today," Yamada announced.

"We could do more."

"We could. But you'll pay for it tomorrow, and tomorrow requires more of you than today." The carpenter began gathering tools. "Sustainable work isn't maximum work. It's optimal work repeated consistently."

"Another lesson?"

"Everything is a lesson. Whether you learn it is your decision."

---

## SCENE 21: END OF DAY ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, work area

Yamada surveyed the day's progress.

Eighty tiles removed and sorted. Primary damage exposed and documented. Secondary damage identified and marked. Tools cleaned, maintained, returned to their designated positions. The work site organized for tomorrow's continuation.

"Acceptable," Yamada said. "For a first day."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. Tomorrow we lift the beams for the temporary support structure. That's where most people decide roof work isn't for them."

"I'll be here."

"I believe you will." Yamada shouldered his tool bundle. "Six AM. Same as today. Bring more food—you'll need it. My nephew Takeshi will join us—the work from here requires three hands."

"I look forward to meeting him."

"He's competent. Trained under me since he was fourteen." Yamada's voice carried the particular pride of someone discussing a successful apprentice. "He'll handle the timber work while we continue with the tiles. Between the three of us, we'll expose whatever the roof is hiding."

He departed down the path toward the village, his silhouette disappearing into the afternoon shadow of the shrine steps.

---

## SCENE 22: POST-WORK OBSERVATION
**Time:** 16:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Sheldon sat on the engawa and examined his hands.

They showed the day's work: small cuts from tile edges, calluses beginning to form where palm met tool handle, dirt embedded in creases that washing would only partially address. Working hands. Hands that had done something tangible, created visible progress, transformed physical reality.

The sensation felt appropriate. He'd been given a body that didn't remember being earned. Today, he'd begun the process of earning it.

---

## SCENE 23: WALK TO MAIN HOUSE
**Time:** 16:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

The late afternoon light had gentled.

Cherry blossoms continued falling, though fewer now—the trees entering the final stage of their spring display. In another few days, the petals would be gone entirely, replaced by the green of new growth.

Sheldon walked slowly, not from fatigue but from a desire to observe. The path he'd traveled a dozen times already this week remained capable of revealing new details: a stone he hadn't noticed, a root that had shifted slightly, a bird's nest visible now that leaves hadn't yet obscured it.

The mountain changed constantly while appearing to remain the same. Like everything else.

---

## SCENE 24: ARRIVAL AT MAIN HOUSE
**Time:** 16:50:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

Katsuhito waited with tea.

"You survived," he said.

"Yamada mentioned that assessment criteria as well."

"It's a fair measure. Many don't." The priest poured tea with his characteristic precision. "How do your hands feel?"

Sheldon examined them again. "Used. But not damaged."

"Tomorrow will be worse. The second day always is—the body protests what you convinced it to accept yesterday."

"Will I actually feel that?"

"I don't know." Katsuhito's gaze carried curiosity. "Your body is different. We've established that. Whether the differences extend to delayed muscle response—that's an open question."

---

## SCENE 25: NOBUYUKI'S DEPARTURE
**Time:** 17:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, entrance

The family was shrinking temporarily.

Nobuyuki stood at the entrance with his small traveling bag, preparing to return to Kurashiki and his architectural work. His weekend visit had extended into Thursday, but responsibilities called.

"I'll return Friday evening," he told Katsuhito. "For the birthday preparations."

"Tenchi will miss you."

"I know." The weight of that knowledge showed in his posture. "I miss him constantly."

The father approached Sheldon last. "Take care of them. While I'm gone."

"I will."

"I know you will. That's why I can leave." Nobuyuki's handshake was firm, direct. "The roof is important. But Tenchi is more important."

"I understand the priority."

"Good."

He departed down the shrine steps, another figure swallowed by the mountain's evening shadow.

---

## SCENE 26: TENCHI'S RETURN
**Time:** 17:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

Kindergarten had released Tenchi into Katsuhito's care.

The child burst through the door with energy that seemed to increase rather than decrease as days progressed. He found Sheldon in the main room and immediately launched into a detailed account of his afternoon.

"—and then Miyamoto-kun found a beetle, but it was a boring beetle, not a good beetle, and Sensei said we can't keep beetles inside anymore because of the smell—"

Sheldon listened with the attention the monologue deserved. Children needed audiences. The specific content mattered less than the fact of being heard.

"—so tomorrow we're going to look for better beetles. Do you like beetles?"

"I've always found them interesting."

"What's your favorite kind?"

"I don't know yet. I haven't seen all the kinds available."

Tenchi considered this. "That's a good answer. I'll show you the good kinds when we find them."

---

## SCENE 27: DINNER PREPARATION
**Time:** 18:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

Without Nobuyuki, the kitchen crew reduced to Sheldon and Katsuhito.

The priest handled the fish—skillfully, years of practice evident in each cut. Sheldon managed vegetables, his assigned domain now established by default. Tenchi contributed enthusiasm and occasional assistance, his small hands helping to tear leaves for salad.

"Papa left," Tenchi said matter-of-factly.

"He'll be back Friday."

"I know. He always comes back." A pause. "He has to work. Work is important."

The acceptance carried the weight of experience. Tenchi had learned this lesson many times—father leaving, father returning, the gap between filled with waiting.

"You could visit him sometime," Sheldon suggested. "In Kurashiki."

"I have. His apartment is small. There's no garden." Tenchi's tone suggested this was a significant failing. "But he has a balcony with plants. I helped him plant them."

"That's good."

"He needed help. He's not good at plants."

---

## SCENE 28: THE EVENING MEAL
**Time:** 18:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Three at the table now.

The absence of Nobuyuki created space that felt larger than a single person warranted. Tenchi sat closer to his grandfather, the arrangement subtly compensating for the missing presence.

Sheldon ate with the appetite Yamada had predicted—body demanding fuel to repair the day's usage. The food tasted extraordinary, each element distinct, the accumulated effort of preparation evident in every bite.

"You worked hard today," Katsuhito observed.

"Yamada set the pace. I followed."

"He said you exceeded his expectations."

"He said I was 'acceptable.'"

"For Yamada, that's exceeding expectations." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "When he's truly disappointed, he says nothing at all."

---

## SCENE 29: AFTER-DINNER QUESTIONS
**Time:** 19:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

"Sheldon-san?" Tenchi's voice had taken on the particular quality that preceded important questions.

"Yes?"

"Did you know Etsuko-baa-san?"

The question landed in unexpected territory. Etsuko—his great-aunt, the woman whose house he'd inherited, whose photographs he'd found, whose life had prepared for his arrival.

"I didn't. She passed before I could meet her."

"Oh." Tenchi processed this. "Grandfather says she was very kind."

"I believe him."

"He also says she could be scary sometimes. When people weren't nice to the house."

"Protective," Katsuhito clarified. "She felt strongly that the house deserved respect."

"Is that why you're fixing it?" Tenchi asked Sheldon. "Because she wanted it respected?"

"Partly. Also because a house that isn't cared for becomes a house that can't care for anyone."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this explanation. "That makes sense. Houses need love too."

---

## SCENE 30: TENCHI'S BEDTIME
**Time:** 19:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, hallway

"Good night, Sheldon-san."

"Good night, Tenchi."

"Tomorrow can I watch more roof work?"

"If your grandfather permits."

"Grandfather?" Tenchi turned to Katsuhito.

"Perhaps briefly. After kindergarten, if you complete your other obligations."

"I will!" The promise carried the fervent certainty of childhood commitments. "Good night, Grandfather."

The formal bow, smaller but no less genuine than an adult's. Then Tenchi disappeared into the bedroom wing, his small feet pattering against the wooden floor.

---

## SCENE 31: EVENING CONVERSATION
**Time:** 20:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

"The council meeting is in six days," Katsuhito said once they were alone.

"I know. I've been considering what to say."

"And?"

"The truth. Or as much of it as I can articulate without sounding insane."

"That's a narrow path."

"It's the only path I have."

Katsuhito poured more tea—the evening's third pot, maintaining the warmth that conversation seemed to require. "The village will have questions you can't answer honestly. They'll expect a life history, family connections, reasons for your arrival."

"I have documented history. The koseki, the family registry, the paper trail."

"Paper can be examined. Memories can't. If they ask about your childhood, your education, your previous work—"

"I'll reference what I remember. Which isn't everything."

"And if they notice gaps?"

Sheldon considered the question with the seriousness it deserved. "Then I tell them I've had difficulties. Memory issues, perhaps. Medical complications. Things I'd rather not discuss in detail."

"That might work. Or it might create more suspicion."

"I know. But I won't claim false memories. I won't pretend experiences I didn't have."

---

## SCENE 32: THE BATH RITUAL
**Time:** 20:35:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, bathroom

The evening bath had become essential.

Not just for cleanliness—though the day's labor had left him needing thorough washing—but for the transition it represented. Work clothes removed, work concerns set aside, the body allowed to simply exist in the water's heat.

Sheldon examined himself in the bath as he had every night. Still no changes beyond the silver flecks in his eyes. No marks, no scars, no visible evidence of the day's strain. His hands showed calluses forming, cuts healing, the ordinary signs of physical labor. But his body hadn't aged a second since awakening in the field.

*What am I becoming?*

The question surfaced again, familiar now. He let it float without demanding answers.

---

## SCENE 33: WALK TO TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 21:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Main House and Tsukino House

Stars again, bright and countless.

The night had grown cold—single digits, probably, the temperature dropping faster than expected. Sheldon's borrowed jacket kept him warm enough, though he'd need proper winter clothing eventually.

The Tsukino house waited at the path's end, dark but present. Tomorrow, work would continue there. The day after. The day after that. Until the roof was sound, the house habitable, the inheritance made real.

---

## SCENE 34: PREPARING FOR SLEEP
**Time:** 21:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The futon welcomed him.

His body, despite not showing fatigue, seemed to recognize the value of rest. He lay in the darkness, listening to the house's settling sounds, the distant owl, the wind moving through cedars.

Day four, complete. First day of real work. Beginning of the process that would transform possibility into reality.

---

## SCENE 35: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** During sleep  
**Location:** Dreamscape

Dorothy Mae's kitchen.

She stood at the stove, stirring something in a pot that produced steam but no visible contents. Her back was to him, her posture the same patient hunch he remembered from a thousand childhood mornings.

*You're learning,* she said without turning.

*I'm trying.*

*That's all anyone can do. Try. Then try again. Then keep trying until you don't have to try anymore.*

He wanted to approach, to see her face, to confirm that this was really his grandmother and not some projection of need.

*Don't rush.* She stirred the invisible contents. *Everything important takes time. Even understanding what's important.*

The kitchen began to fade. He reached toward her, but the distance increased rather than decreased.

*Wait—*

*I'm always here.* Her voice came from everywhere now, surrounding rather than originating. *Even when you can't see me.*

---

## SCENE 36: FIFTH DAWN
**Time:** 05:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

He woke before the alarm he'd set in his mind.

Day five. More roof work. More learning. More building toward something that might eventually resemble a life.

His hands, when he examined them in the darkness, showed no additional soreness. The second-day protest Katsuhito had predicted hadn't materialized. His body simply continued functioning, ready for whatever he asked of it.

He rose to meet the morning.

---
