## Galaxy Police Career

### Skills
- Excellent pilot
- Skilled in combat
- Natural leader
- Good at undercover work (uses beauty as distraction)

### The Crash
**CANON:** Amane's ship crashed on Earth due to Seina's probability field pulling her down. This "accident" led to:
- First contact with Seina
- His recruitment into GP
- The beginning of their relationship

Whether this was truly accident or Seto's manipulation remains unclear.

---

## Relationship with Seina

Amane initially saw Seina as:
- A curiosity
- A recruit she was responsible for
- Someone pathetic but strangely endearing

This evolved into:
- Genuine attraction (despite herself)
- Protective feelings
- Respect for his courage
- Love (eventually marriage)

### The Rivalry
Amane competes with Kiriko and others for Seina's attention. Their rivalry is:
- Genuine but not hostile
- Often comedic
- Eventually resolved through polygamous marriage

---

## The Seto Connection

Seto has taken special interest in Amane:
- Sees her potential beyond modeling
- Uses her as a project in matchmaking schemes
- Arranged her assignment to Seina's unit
- Views Amane as "reformable" aristocrat

Amane is simultaneously grateful for and wary of Seto's attention.

## Family Connections

| Relation | Person | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon POV:**
- The name "Amane"
- Any reference to modeling in space
- Any reference to GP officers besides canon arrivals

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **GXP TIMELINE:** Amane's story runs parallel to OVA events. She crashes on Earth around Year 13-14, triggering Seina's GXP arc.

🔮 **POTENTIAL CROSSOVER:** If GXP events intersect with main story, Amane may appear at Masaki household. Her personality would clash/complement the existing dynamics.

📖 **THEMATIC PARALLEL:** Like Sheldon, Amane left a comfortable existence for something harder. Unlike Sheldon, she chose to.

---

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Amane is NOT shallow — her vanity masks genuine heroism
- She is NOT just fanservice — she's a developed character
- Her interest in Seina is GENUINE, not manipulation
- She is NOT helpless — she's a skilled GP officer
