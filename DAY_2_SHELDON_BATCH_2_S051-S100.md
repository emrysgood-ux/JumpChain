## SCENE S051: MISO SOUP
**Time:** 07:26:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The miso soup arrived at his lips with steam still rising.

He sipped carefully, testing the temperature before committing to a full taste. The broth spread across his tongue with layers of flavor that unfolded in sequence. First the salt, clean and bright. Then the fermented depth of the miso itself, that particular earthiness that three years in wooden barrels had developed. Then the dashi underneath, the fish and kelp notes that formed the foundation of everything.

Cubes of silken tofu floated in the liquid, their texture dissolving against his palate. Wakame seaweed added a mineral note that grounded the sweetness of the miso. Green onion slices provided a sharp contrast that cut through the richness.

"You taste it properly."

Katsuhito's observation came as a statement rather than a question. The old man had noticed his attention to the soup.

"The miso is exceptional." Not flattery. The truth.

---

## SCENE S052: PICKLES
**Time:** 07:28:47 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The pickles demanded their own attention.

Tsukemono, the shared plate offered several varieties. He recognized cucumber, its green skin still visible beneath the pickling transformation. Something orange that might be carrot or daikon radish, he could not tell. A darker slice that looked like eggplant, its purple-black surface glistening with the brine that had preserved it.

He selected a cucumber slice with his chopsticks, the grip secure despite the pickle's slippery surface. The crunch when he bit down carried the memory of fresh vegetable transformed by salt and time into something else entirely. The flavor was sour and salty and vegetal all at once, a counterpoint to the rice that made both elements more interesting.

"The cucumber is from last summer." Katsuhito offered the context. "Preserved in nuka bran. The flavor develops over months."

Fermentation again. Time as an ingredient. The patience required to make food this way spoke of a lifestyle fundamentally different from the one he had known.

---

## SCENE S053: KATSUHITO OBSERVES
**Time:** 07:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The old man watched him eat.

Not staring. Not obviously studying. But observing with the peripheral attention of someone who had learned to see without looking. Katsuhito lifted his own rice bowl and ate with unhurried precision, but his awareness extended beyond his own meal.

He knew he was being assessed. The knowledge did not disturb him. He would be assessed constantly here, by Katsuhito and the village and anyone else who encountered the strange newcomer with the unlikely story of American birth and Japanese inheritance. Every action communicated something. Every reaction revealed something.

He ate with deliberate care, neither rushing nor dawdling. He used his chopsticks properly. He finished each bite before taking the next. He did not slurp his soup, though his knowledge told him that slurping was acceptable and even expected for noodles.

If he was being tested, he would pass what tests he could.

---

## SCENE S054: CONVERSATION BEGINS
**Time:** 07:32:45 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"Your house requires significant work."

Katsuhito opened the subject without preamble. The old man's tone carried assessment rather than judgment, the observation of someone stating facts rather than offering opinion.

"I noticed." He set down his soup bowl. "The roof especially."

"The roof is urgent. Rainy season begins in mid-June. Any water that enters will accelerate the damage to everything beneath." Katsuhito picked up a pickle and ate it with precise efficiency. "The floors can wait. The walls can wait. The roof cannot."

He absorbed the priority structure. Roof first. The rest would follow.

"I have no skills for roof repair."

"No." Katsuhito's agreement came without softening. "But skills can be learned. And there are those in the village who can teach, if you are willing to learn."

---

## SCENE S055: HOUSE VISIT PROPOSAL
**Time:** 07:34:58 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"After breakfast, I will take you to the house properly."

The offer came with the authority of someone stating fact rather than asking permission. Katsuhito intended to inspect the property with him, to show him what needed to be done in what order. The old man had likely walked through that house a hundred times during the years of its emptiness.

"I would appreciate that." The formal acceptance felt right. Katsuhito was offering expertise freely. The least he could do was receive it with proper gratitude.

"We will examine everything. Foundation to roof. Every room. Every system." Katsuhito lifted his rice bowl again. "You must understand what you are undertaking before you commit to it. Renovation of a traditional house is not a small matter."

"I understand."

He understood nothing, really. But he would learn.

---

## SCENE S056: TIMELINE DISCUSSION
**Time:** 07:36:41 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"How long do you expect the renovation to take?"

The question came from Katsuhito with the weight of genuine interest. The old man wanted to know his thinking, wanted to assess whether he had realistic expectations or naive optimism.

"I have no basis for estimation." Honesty seemed the only viable approach. "Months, at minimum. Possibly years."

Katsuhito nodded. "Months for the essential repairs. Years for full restoration, if that is your intention." The old man set down his empty rice bowl. "The house was well-built originally. Good bones, as the carpenters say. But neglect extracts its price, and that price compounds over time."

"I will start with what is most urgent and proceed from there."

"A reasonable approach." Something that might have been approval flickered across Katsuhito's features. "Yamada-san will help you understand the scope of work required. He knows the house, and he knows what can be done with limited resources."

---

## SCENE S057: CARPENTER MENTION
**Time:** 07:38:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"Yamada-san is the village carpenter?"

"One of them. The best of them, though he would never say so." Katsuhito gathered his empty dishes and stacked them with the unconscious efficiency of long habit. "His family has built and repaired houses in this valley for generations. He learned from his father, who learned from his father. The knowledge runs deep."

He filed the information away. A carpenter with generational knowledge. Someone who could teach as well as work, if the teaching was desired.

"Is he available? To assess the house?"

"I will introduce you this afternoon. He will look at the house tomorrow, perhaps, if his schedule permits." Katsuhito stood with the fluid motion of someone whose body had not betrayed him despite his age. "First, finish your breakfast. Then we will examine what you have inherited."

---

## SCENE S058: VILLAGE RESOURCES
**Time:** 07:40:15 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"The village has a general store, a vegetable seller, and a small hardware shop."

Katsuhito delivered the inventory while clearing dishes, his voice carrying the information as casually as if discussing weather. "For larger purchases, one must travel to Kurashiki. The train runs twice daily in each direction."

He processed the logistics. Limited local supply. Major procurement requiring travel. Everything would take longer than it would in a city.

"Building materials?"

"Yamada-san maintains supplies for common repairs. For substantial work, orders must be placed with suppliers in Okayama or Kurashiki. Delivery takes time." Katsuhito paused at the kitchen doorway. "You will learn patience, living here. Everything moves at its own pace."

Patience had never been his strongest quality. Perhaps it would need to become one.

---

## SCENE S059: TENCHI WAKES
**Time:** 07:42:38 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

A sound from the hallway announced Tenchi's emergence from sleep.

Small feet shuffling on wooden floors. A child's voice making sounds that were not quite words, the mumbling protest of someone dragged from slumber against their will. The sliding door to the sleeping quarters opened, and Tenchi appeared in its frame.

The boy looked smaller than he had yesterday, somehow. Sleep-rumpled in his pajamas, his hair sticking out in directions that defied gravity, his eyes still carrying the glaze of not-quite-awake. He saw Katsuhito first, then turned and noticed the guest at the table.

"Sheldon-san."

The address came with the slight formality of a child practicing proper behavior. Then the formality cracked and the curiosity beneath showed through.

"Are you staying for breakfast?"

---

## SCENE S060: TENCHI ENTRANCE
**Time:** 07:44:51 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Tenchi shuffled to the table and collapsed onto his cushion with the boneless grace of a four-year-old.

The boy's breakfast waited for him, the smaller rice bowl and soup that Katsuhito had prepared. Tenchi looked at the food with an expression that mixed hunger and reluctance, the particular morning face of someone who wanted to eat but resented the necessity of being awake.

"Itadakimasu." The phrase came automatically, the ritual drilled so deeply that even half-sleep could not prevent it.

"Good morning, Tenchi." He offered the greeting with careful warmth. Not too familiar. Not too distant. A guest acknowledging the child of the house.

Tenchi blinked at him over the rim of his soup bowl. "Good morning." A pause while the boy sipped his soup. "Are you going to fix your house today?"

The directness of children. No preamble, no social navigation, just straight to the question that interested them.

"I am going to look at it properly. Your grandfather is going to show me what needs to be fixed."

---

## SCENE S061: TENCHI'S BREAKFAST
**Time:** 07:46:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Tenchi ate with the particular intensity of a child fueling growth.

The boy's chopsticks moved from rice to soup to pickles with an efficiency that belied his sleepy appearance. Food vanished at a rate that suggested genuine hunger rather than mere compliance with mealtime expectations. His small hands held the chopsticks correctly, the grip natural and practiced despite his age.

"Slower, Tenchi." Katsuhito returned from the kitchen and settled onto his cushion. "Breakfast is not a race."

"I know." The boy did not slow down. "But the bus comes soon."

He watched the interaction with interest. Grandfather and grandson, bound by blood and daily routine and the particular intimacy of shared household. Tenchi respected Katsuhito without fearing him. Katsuhito guided Tenchi without controlling him. The balance looked healthy.

---

## SCENE S062: TENCHI'S QUESTIONS
**Time:** 07:48:47 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"Sheldon-san?" Tenchi looked up from his nearly-empty rice bowl. "Are you really from America?"

The question arrived with the guilelessness of genuine curiosity. A child processing strange information, trying to make sense of a stranger who had appeared in their orderly world.

"I was born there. In a place called Georgia." He kept his answer simple, appropriate for the audience. "It's very far away."

"Jii-chan showed me on the globe." Tenchi pointed with his chopsticks, a gesture that earned a soft correction from Katsuhito. "It's across the ocean. Very far."

"Yes. Very far."

"But you speak Japanese."

"My mother taught me." The lie came easily. The truth was too complex for any audience, let alone a four-year-old.

Tenchi accepted the answer with the easy trust of childhood. Adults said things and children believed them. The world was simpler when you hadn't learned to question.

---

## SCENE S063: SCHOOL PREPARATION
**Time:** 07:50:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"Tenchi, you must get ready for school."

Katsuhito's reminder carried the weight of routine. The boy knew what came next without being told, but the prompt served to end the breakfast and begin the transition.

"I know." Tenchi finished his last bite of rice and performed a hasty bow over his dishes. "Gochisousama." I have received a feast. The closing phrase of a meal.

The boy scrambled to his feet with the energy that seemed to have appeared from nowhere, sleep's lethargy replaced by the kinetic urgency of a child with places to be. He headed down the hallway with footsteps that were louder than strictly necessary.

"He attends kindergarten in the village." Katsuhito gathered Tenchi's dishes. "The bus collects him at the bottom of the shrine steps at eight-fifteen. Forty minutes remains."

Forty minutes for a four-year-old to transform from sleepy to school-ready. It seemed like a lot of time. He suspected it was not.

---

## SCENE S064: BUS SCHEDULE
**Time:** 07:52:08 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"The bus makes one circuit in the morning and one in the afternoon."

Katsuhito continued providing logistics while clearing the table. "It serves all the farms and houses in the valley, picking up children for the kindergarten and elementary school in the village center. The route takes approximately forty minutes from start to finish."

He absorbed the information. Rural school transportation, serving a population spread across mountain slopes and valley floors. Every child riding the same bus, knowing every other child, their families interconnected across generations.

"Tenchi enjoys the ride?"

"He enjoys seeing his friends. The ride itself is simply transportation." Katsuhito stacked dishes on the tray with precise placement. "He has been riding since age three, when the kindergarten accepted him. The routine is deeply established."

The shrine was home. The bus was connection. The school was community. Tenchi's world had clear boundaries and reliable patterns.

---

## SCENE S065: MEAL CONCLUSION
**Time:** 07:54:41 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

He finished his own breakfast with deliberate attention.

The last of the rice. The final sips of soup, cooled now but still flavorful. A last pickle chosen carefully, the orange daikon that he had been saving. Each element deserved acknowledgment. Each had been prepared with care.

"Gochisousama deshita."

The fuller form of the phrase seemed appropriate. I have received a feast, truly. The formality honored the hospitality that had been extended.

Katsuhito nodded acceptance of the thanks without comment. The old man had already moved into the next phase, his mind apparently on the tasks ahead rather than the meal just completed. Practical efficiency beneath the ritual surface.

"Bring your dishes to the kitchen. We will wash them before departing."

The instruction came as natural expectation rather than demand. Guests contributed to household function. He gathered his bowls and followed.

---

## SCENE S066: CLEARING DISHES
**Time:** 07:56:18 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The kitchen showed its working nature more clearly without breakfast preparation in progress.

He set his dishes beside the sink where Katsuhito had placed the others. The collection looked modest despite feeding three people: six bowls, three small plates, chopsticks, the shared pickle dish. Japanese meals used more individual vessels than American ones, but smaller portions in each.

Water ran into the sink from a proper faucet. Hot water even, fed from a small heater mounted on the wall. The contrast with his own house's primitive pump sharpened. Modern convenience existed here. His inheritance offered historical charm and practical challenges.

"You may wash. I will dry." Katsuhito handed him a rough cloth for scrubbing. "The soap is in the dish by the faucet."

He positioned himself before the sink and began working through the stack.

---

## SCENE S067: WASHING OBSERVATION
**Time:** 07:58:03 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

Japanese dish soap behaved differently than what he had known.

Less foam. More concentration. The small amount he squeezed onto the cloth spread further than expected, suds forming only when he scrubbed rather than building immediately in the water. Effective, but requiring adjustment of technique.

The bowls cleaned easily, their ceramic surfaces releasing food residue without protest. The rice pot required more attention, grains stuck to the bottom where the heating element had concentrated. He scraped carefully with the cloth, avoiding pressure that might damage the coating.

Katsuhito stood beside him with a towel, receiving each cleaned item and drying it with efficient strokes. The towel was cotton, worn soft from countless uses, its weave loose enough to absorb water quickly. Simple tools perfected by repetition.

"You have washed dishes before."

The observation came without inflection. Katsuhito noting competence where he found it.

"Yes." He had lived alone for years. Dishes were not mysterious.

---

## SCENE S068: KATSUHITO'S EFFICIENCY
**Time:** 08:00:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The old man dried dishes with a speed that made his own washing seem slow.

Each bowl received three precise strokes of the towel and went into the drying rack completely dry. Each plate took four strokes. The chopsticks, grouped together, dried in a single motion that seemed impossible but clearly worked. Katsuhito had developed this efficiency over decades, his hands knowing exactly where water clung and exactly how much pressure to apply.

He tried to wash faster to match the drying pace. His speed increased but his thoroughness suffered, a smudge of miso on one bowl requiring a second pass. The balance between speed and quality required its own learning.

"Slower is better." Katsuhito had noticed the compromise. "Clean dishes matter more than fast dishes."

A lesson applicable beyond dishwashing. He adjusted his pace accordingly.

---

## SCENE S069: TENCHI DEPARTURE PREP
**Time:** 08:02:48 JST  
**Location:** Main House, hallway to genkan

Tenchi reappeared in school-appropriate clothing.

The transformation from sleepy child to presentable student had taken the full forty minutes. His hair had been tamed, mostly. His clothes were clean and properly arranged, a light blue shirt and navy shorts with white socks pulled to the knee. A small yellow backpack hung from his shoulders, the kind designed for young children with padded straps and reflective strips.

"Jii-chan, where is my lunch?"

"In the refrigerator where it always is." Katsuhito dried the last dish and set it in the rack. "Retrieve it yourself. You are old enough."

Tenchi ran to the kitchen with the particular intensity of a child on a deadline. Cabinets opened and closed. The refrigerator door swung. Then the boy returned with a small cloth-wrapped bundle, his bento box for the midday meal.

"I have it!"

"Good. Now say goodbye properly."

---

## SCENE S070: TENCHI LEAVES
**Time:** 08:04:55 JST  
**Location:** Main House, genkan

Tenchi stood at the genkan, his shoes on, his bag adjusted, his lunch clutched against his chest.

"Goodbye, Jii-chan." The boy bowed with the approximate formality of a four-year-old. "Goodbye, Sheldon-san." A separate bow, shallower but genuine.

"Have a good day at school, Tenchi." He returned the bow with appropriate depth for an adult addressing a child. "Learn many things."

The boy grinned at the instruction, the kind of expression that suggested learning was not his primary concern. Then he was out the door and running, his footsteps quick on the path that led down to the shrine steps and the bus stop below.

Katsuhito watched from the doorway until the small figure disappeared around a bend in the path. Only then did the old man turn back inside.

"He is a good child."

The statement seemed to seek no response. Katsuhito was simply speaking truth.

---

## SCENE S071: RETURN INSIDE
**Time:** 08:06:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, genkan

"We should change into work clothes."

Katsuhito gestured toward the interior of the house. "What you are wearing is appropriate for receiving guests. It is not appropriate for examining roof damage and crawling beneath floors."

He looked down at his dress shirt and slacks. The old man was right. These clothes would not survive the inspection Katsuhito had described.

"I have nothing else."

"I expected as much." Katsuhito walked past him toward the rear of the house. "I have clothing that may fit you. Old garments that I keep for dirty work. They will not be elegant, but they will serve."

He followed the old man through the house, past the main room and into a storage area he had not seen before. Traditional farmworker clothing hung on hooks along one wall, faded from years of washing but intact.

---

## SCENE S072: HOUSE TOUR PROPOSAL
**Time:** 08:08:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, storage area

"This one should fit."

Katsuhito pulled a set of clothing from the hooks and held it out for inspection. A jacket of indigo fabric, the kind worn by farmers and craftsmen. Matching trousers, loose-fitting and practical. Both showed the soft wear of garments that had been used for real work.

"These are yours?"

"They were my son-in-law's, from before he became an architect." A slight pause. "Nobuyuki worked with his hands when he was young. These clothes remember that time."

He accepted the garments with appropriate care. Borrowed clothing from a family he had barely met, offered freely because the need was obvious. The kindness accumulated, debt upon debt that he could not yet repay.

"Thank you."

Katsuhito nodded. "There is a room where you may change. Then we will see what your house requires."

---

## SCENE S073: WALKING WITH KATSUHITO
**Time:** 08:10:15 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino House

The path felt different walking with Katsuhito.

Yesterday he had walked it alone, discovering each turn and obstacle for himself. Today the old man set the pace, his steps sure and economical, his body moving through space with an efficiency that wasted nothing. Katsuhito knew every stone, every root, every place where the ground dipped or rose.

He walked slightly behind, watching and learning. The old man's feet placed themselves with intention, never hesitating, never stumbling. This was knowledge earned through repetition, the physical memory of a route traveled thousands of times.

"The path was here when I arrived." Katsuhito spoke without turning. "The Tsukino family maintained it for generations before that."

"When did they leave?"

"The last of them died seventeen years ago. Yuki's father. The house has stood empty since."

Seventeen years of weather and neglect. No wonder the roof needed work.

---

## SCENE S074: PATH HISTORY
**Time:** 08:12:33 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino House

"The original path was wider."

Katsuhito pointed to overgrown areas on either side where the forest had reclaimed former ground. "When the Tsukino family farmed this land, carts traveled this route carrying harvest down to the village. The stones you walk on were placed to bear that weight."

He looked at the path with new eyes. The stones were indeed substantial, larger than necessary for foot traffic alone. They had been chosen and placed with the intention of supporting loads, of serving practical needs rather than merely marking a route.

"What did they farm?"

"Rice in the lower paddies. Tea on the upper slopes. Vegetables and fruit for household use." Katsuhito stepped over a root that crossed the path. "The paddies have gone fallow. The tea plants grow wild. Only the fruit trees survive, tended by habit rather than intent."

An agricultural history lost to time and circumstance. The land remembering purposes its current state could not fulfill.

---

## SCENE S075: PROPERTY BOUNDARIES
**Time:** 08:14:48 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino House

"Your inheritance includes approximately two hectares."

The figure meant little to him in practical terms. Katsuhito seemed to sense this.

"About five acres in American measure. The house and immediate garden. The former paddies below. The hillside above to the ridge line." The old man gestured expansively. "More land than you can maintain alone, but valuable if properly managed."

He tried to comprehend the scope. Five acres of mountain property. Forest and former farmland and a house that had been standing for generations. All of it now his, legally speaking, even if his connection to it remained invented rather than earned.

"The boundaries are marked?"

"Stone markers at the corners. Agreements with neighbors respected for longer than anyone can remember." Katsuhito's voice carried something that might have been humor. "The village knows what belongs to whom. The markers are merely reminders."

---

## SCENE S076: FIRST FULL VIEW
**Time:** 08:16:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House exterior

The house revealed itself differently in full daylight.

Yesterday he had arrived in late afternoon, tired from travel and overwhelmed by strangeness. Today, with morning light illuminating every surface, he could see what his inheritance actually looked like.

The structure was larger than he had realized. Single story, but spreading across the slope in the traditional minka style, its shape following the terrain rather than fighting it. The main building contained the living quarters he had explored. Attached structures extended on either side, their purposes not yet clear.

"The original house was built in the late Edo period." Katsuhito stood beside him, surveying the property with an appraiser's eye. "Additions came later. The kitchen wing in the Meiji era. The storage building after the war."

Three generations of construction, visible in the slight differences of timber color and joint style. A house that had grown with its family, adapting to needs as they arose.

---

## SCENE S077: FOUNDATION CHECK
**Time:** 08:18:45 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House exterior

"We begin with the foundation."

Katsuhito crouched at the base of the house where it met the ground. The structure rested on stone pillars, the traditional method of construction that allowed air to circulate beneath the floor and moisture to escape.

"Come. Look."

He knelt beside the old man and examined what Katsuhito indicated. The stone pillars appeared solid, their surfaces weathered but intact. No obvious cracks. No shifting that might indicate settling.

"The stones are good." Katsuhito tapped one with his knuckle. "Granite, from quarries that no longer operate. They will outlast anything built upon them."

Good news, then. The bones of the structure were sound.

"The wooden posts that rest upon them require inspection." Katsuhito pointed to the joints where wood met stone. "Moisture collects at these junctions. Rot begins where you cannot see."

---

## SCENE S078: WALL CONDITION
**Time:** 08:20:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House exterior

They moved along the outer wall, Katsuhito running his hands over the surface like a doctor examining a patient.

"The plaster is original." The old man's fingers found a spot where the surface had crumbled. "It was made from local clay mixed with rice straw and lime. When maintained, it lasts for centuries. When neglected..."

The gesture indicated what neglect had accomplished. Sections of plaster had fallen away entirely, exposing the bamboo lattice beneath. Other sections remained intact but showed cracks that would admit water given time.

"Can it be repaired?"

"Patched, yes. The traditional method requires materials and skills that have grown rare." Katsuhito moved to another section. "Modern alternatives exist. They last well enough but lack the character of the original."

A choice between authenticity and practicality. He suspected many such choices lay ahead.

---

## SCENE S079: ROOF OVERVIEW
**Time:** 08:22:48 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House exterior

They stepped back from the house to view the roof.

The structure showed its age most clearly from this angle. The traditional Japanese roof, designed to shed rain and snow with its steep pitch and wide eaves, had suffered visibly from seventeen years without maintenance. Tiles were missing in several places, dark gaps in the clay surface like missing teeth. Other tiles had cracked or shifted, their alignment disturbed by freeze-thaw cycles and settling timber beneath.

"The roof is your priority." Katsuhito's voice carried weight. "Everything else can wait. The roof cannot."

He studied the damage, trying to estimate the scope. Dozens of tiles needed replacement. The underlying structure might need repair before new tiles could be installed. Materials would need to be sourced, transported, carried up ladders.

"How long to repair?"

"Weeks of work, if the supporting structure is sound. Longer if rot has reached the rafters."

---

## SCENE S080: KATSUHITO'S ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 08:24:55 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House exterior

The old man stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his expression unreadable.

"You see now what you are undertaking."

Not a question. A statement that invited response. Katsuhito wanted to know if his guest understood the magnitude of the task, if the morning's inspection had clarified the scope of work required.

"Yes." He kept his voice level. "The house needs extensive repair. The roof is urgent. The walls can wait. The foundation is sound. The interior requires attention but is not critical."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "You summarize accurately. The question becomes: are you willing to do the work? Months of labor. Significant expense. Skills you do not yet possess."

"I have nowhere else to go."

The truth came out before he could consider whether it was wise to share. Katsuhito received it without visible reaction.

"Then we continue the inspection. You should understand everything before you commit."

---

## SCENE S081: GARDEN RUINS
**Time:** 08:26:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House garden

They walked through what had once been a garden.

The bones of formal design remained visible beneath the chaos of unchecked growth. Stone pathways that would have guided visitors through carefully planned vistas. Granite lanterns now draped in vines that threatened to pull them from their bases. A small pond, dry and leaf-choked, that might once have held koi.

"Yuki's grandmother created this garden." Katsuhito picked his way through the undergrowth. "She spent thirty years refining it. Every stone was placed with intention. Every plant was chosen for its contribution to the whole."

Thirty years of work, erased by seventeen years of neglect. The mathematics of decay operated faster than the mathematics of creation.

"Can it be restored?"

"Anything can be restored if time and effort are applied." The old man paused at a moss-covered lantern. "Whether it should be is a different question. Perhaps you will create something new rather than recreating what was lost."

---

## SCENE S082: WELL INSPECTION
**Time:** 08:28:47 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House well area

The well occupied a clearing between the main house and the garden.

A wooden structure protected the opening, its roof intact despite the weathering that had damaged the main house. The pump mechanism that he had used that morning attached to the side, its cast iron body showing rust but no obvious damage.

"The well was dug when the house was built." Katsuhito worked the pump handle experimentally. Water flowed after a few strokes. "Fed by an underground spring that has never failed. Even in the driest summers, this well produces."

Reliable water. Essential for any habitation, more so for renovation work that would generate dust and require cleanup.

"The water is safe to drink?"

"It has been drunk for two hundred years without ill effect." Katsuhito let the water run, watching its clarity. "Mountain water, filtered through rock and soil. Cleaner than anything that comes from municipal pipes."

---

## SCENE S083: OUTBUILDING CHECK
**Time:** 08:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House outbuilding

The storage building stood separate from the main house, its construction noticeably newer.

Post-war construction, Katsuhito had said. The concrete foundation and metal roof contrasted with the traditional materials of the older structures. Pragmatic rather than beautiful, built for function when resources were scarce.

The door opened with resistance, its hinges protesting years of disuse. Inside, the space held equipment whose purposes he could only guess. Agricultural implements, rusted but recognizable. Barrels that might once have held pickles or sake. Wooden crates stacked in corners, their contents unknown.

"This building remains weathertight." Katsuhito inspected the walls and ceiling. "You can store materials here during renovation. Keep things dry while the main house receives attention."

A staging area. A practical asset that he had not considered. The old man thought in terms of logistics while he was still processing the scope of the problem.

---

## SCENE S084: TREE PROXIMITY
**Time:** 08:32:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House exterior, north side

"The cedar is too close."

Katsuhito indicated a large tree whose branches extended over the roof. The cedar was massive, its trunk wider than his armspan, its canopy casting permanent shadow on the building beneath.

"The roots are undermining the foundation on this side. The branches drop debris that accelerates roof decay. The tree must be trimmed at minimum. Removed, ideally." The old man's tone carried regret. "It is a beautiful tree. But it threatens the house."

He looked at the cedar with new perspective. A tree that had grown for a century or more, reaching toward sunlight without awareness of the structure in its path. The house and the tree could not both thrive. A choice would need to be made.

"Removal would require professionals?"

"And permission from the village forestry council. The tree is large enough to fall under their jurisdiction."

Another complication. Another item for the growing list.

---

## SCENE S085: ENTRY WITH PURPOSE
**Time:** 08:34:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House interior

They entered the house through the main door, Katsuhito leading with the confidence of someone who had walked these rooms many times.

"We will examine everything systematically." The old man paused in the genkan to remove his outdoor sandals and slip into house slippers. "Room by room. Floor to ceiling. I will explain what I observe. You will learn to see what I see."

He followed the ritual of shoe removal and waited for instruction. The inspection would be thorough, Katsuhito's method clearly established by long experience.

"The genkan first." The old man crouched and examined the floor level where interior met entrance. "Water enters here when rain is driven by wind. See the discoloration where moisture has penetrated?"

He looked where Katsuhito indicated. A faint darkening of the wood, subtle but visible once pointed out. Water damage beginning its slow destruction.

## SCENE S086: ENTRANCE STRUCTURE
**Time:** 08:36:18 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House genkan

"The support beams above us are critical."

Katsuhito stood and looked upward, his eyes tracing the wooden members that held the ceiling. "They bear the weight of everything above. If they fail, the entrance collapses."

He studied the beams with new attention. The wood looked solid enough to his untrained eye, but he understood now that appearance could deceive. Rot might lurk within sound-looking timber, weakening structure without visible warning.

"How do you test them?"

"Sound. Feel. Experience." Katsuhito reached up and struck one beam with his knuckle. The sound was dull and solid. "Good wood resonates. Damaged wood sounds hollow." He moved to another beam and repeated the test. A similar sound. "These are sound. But the inspection must continue to be certain."

Every beam would need testing. Every joint. The thoroughness of proper inspection revealed itself as a labor of hours rather than minutes.

---

## SCENE S087: BEAM ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 08:38:45 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House main room

The main room's central beam ran the length of the house.

Katsuhito stood beneath it and examined its underside with what appeared to be casual interest but was clearly systematic assessment. His eyes moved along the wood, stopping at joints, lingering on areas of discoloration, tracking the grain from one end to the other.

"This beam is original." The old man's voice carried respect. "Cut from a tree that grew on this mountain. See the quality of the grain?"

He looked and saw dense lines running parallel along the wood's surface. Tight growth rings indicating slow development, the kind of wood that came from old forests rather than plantation timber.

"Old-growth wood resists damage better than modern lumber." Katsuhito continued his inspection. "It is denser, stronger, less prone to warping. This beam could support the house for another two hundred years if properly maintained."

The beam as a timeline. As a promise of durability that extended beyond individual lives.

---

## SCENE S088: TATAMI CONDITION
**Time:** 08:40:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House main room

"The tatami requires replacement."

Katsuhito knelt and lifted the edge of one mat, revealing the wooden floor beneath. The underside of the mat showed moisture damage, the rice straw filling compressed and discolored.

"Tatami should be replaced every ten to fifteen years with normal use. These have not been changed in at least twenty." The old man let the mat fall back into place. "They retain moisture. They harbor insects. They must go before you can properly use this room."

Another expense. Another task. He nodded understanding.

"Can the work be done in stages?"

"Yes. Replace the most damaged first. The rest can wait until resources allow." Katsuhito moved to another mat and repeated his inspection. "This one is worse. The moisture has reached the floor beneath."

Floor damage beneath tatami damage. Problems layered upon problems.

---

## SCENE S089: WALL PANELS
**Time:** 08:42:48 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House main room

The shoji screens that divided rooms showed their age.

Paper panels had torn in several places, the rice paper that should filter light now admitting it through ragged holes. The wooden frames remained sound, their joinery tight despite the years, but the paper would need complete replacement.

"Shoji paper is inexpensive to replace." Katsuhito slid one panel along its track, testing the smoothness of movement. "The technique requires practice but not special skill. You can learn to do this yourself."

A task he could accomplish without professional help. A small victory in a landscape of challenges requiring expertise.

"The frames themselves?"

"Sound. See how the panel slides smoothly? The tracks are not warped, the frame not twisted." Katsuhito closed the panel again. "Traditional joinery, properly made, survives conditions that would destroy modern construction."

---

## SCENE S090: FLOOR LEVEL CHECK
**Time:** 08:44:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House main room

"Stand here."

Katsuhito indicated a spot near the center of the room. He moved to stand there, feeling the floor solid beneath his slippered feet.

"Now walk slowly toward the north wall. Notice how the floor feels."

He walked as instructed, paying attention to the sensation beneath his feet. Near the center, the floor felt stable. As he approached the north wall, a subtle give appeared, the boards flexing more than they should under his weight.

"You feel it?"

"Yes. The floor is softer here."

"Settling." Katsuhito joined him near the wall. "The support beneath this section has shifted over time. Not dangerous yet, but requiring attention before the problem worsens."

Foundation work, then. Not the stone pillars Katsuhito had praised, but the wooden structure that rested upon them. Another layer of complexity.

---

## SCENE S091: KATSUHITO TEACHES
**Time:** 08:46:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House main room

The old man crouched and pressed his palm against the floor, feeling for something he could not see.

"Traditional construction allows for this." Katsuhito's voice took on the tone of instruction. "The posts rest on stones but are not fixed to them. When settling occurs, the posts can be lifted and the support adjusted."

"The posts can be raised?"

"With proper tools and technique, yes. Yamada-san has done this work many times. He will assess whether simple adjustment suffices or whether more extensive repair is needed."

Another skill he would need to learn or hire. The renovation curriculum expanded with every room they examined.

"Watch. Feel." Katsuhito stood and moved to another section of floor. "The building speaks to those who know how to listen. It tells you where it is strong and where it needs help."

---

## SCENE S092: KITCHEN STRUCTURE
**Time:** 08:48:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House kitchen

The kitchen wing required separate assessment.

"This section was added later." Katsuhito examined the joint where the addition met the original structure. "Different builders, different materials, different methods. The connection points are where problems often appear."

He looked at the seam between old and new construction. A visible line where timber of different ages met, the joint sealed with plaster that had cracked over the years.

"Water enters through these cracks?"

"Yes. And the different rates of settling between original and addition create stress." Katsuhito pointed to hairline fractures in the plaster. "Not urgent, but requiring attention eventually."

The kitchen itself showed the same mix of damage and durability as the rest of the house. Solid construction compromised by years of neglect, requiring attention but not yet falling apart.

---

## SCENE S093: PLUMBING STATE
**Time:** 08:50:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House kitchen

"The plumbing is primitive by modern standards."

Katsuhito indicated the pump he had already tested and the drain system beneath the sink. "Water comes from the well. Waste goes to a septic system buried in the garden. The system works but offers no hot water and limited capacity."

"Can hot water be added?"

"Yes. A small water heater can be installed. The gas supply that serves the stove can be extended." The old man examined the existing pipe work. "The pipes themselves are copper. Still serviceable despite their age."

Copper pipes. Durable material that would last with minimal maintenance. One aspect of the house that did not require immediate replacement.

"The gas lines will need inspection before any new connections." Katsuhito added the caveat. "Old gas systems can harbor leaks. Safety requires certainty."

---

## SCENE S094: VENTILATION
**Time:** 08:52:18 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House kitchen

"Kitchens require proper ventilation."

Katsuhito moved to the window above the counter, examining its operation. The glass was intact, the frame functional, the window opening and closing without difficulty.

"This window serves the purpose when weather permits." The old man closed the window and turned to the ceiling. "The chimney above the stove provides draft when cooking produces smoke. Both systems are passive. No fans, no mechanical assistance."

Traditional solutions to traditional problems. The kitchen had been designed before electric ventilation existed, its airflow managed through openings and natural convection.

"In hot weather?"

"In hot weather, you cook early in the morning or late in the evening. Or you accept the heat." A faint smile crossed Katsuhito's features. "Air conditioning is a modern expectation. Traditional houses survived centuries without it."

---

## SCENE S095: COUNTER SURFACES
**Time:** 08:54:08 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House kitchen

The kitchen counter told its own history.

He ran his hand across the surface, feeling the smoothness of wood worn by decades of food preparation. Knife marks created shallow channels in the grain. Stains from vegetables and spices had darkened certain areas. The accumulated evidence of meals prepared and consumed, family fed and nurtured.

"Hinoki cypress." Katsuhito identified the wood. "The same material used for temple construction. Naturally antibacterial, resistant to moisture, beautiful when maintained."

He pressed his palm against the surface, feeling the solidity beneath. The counter did not flex or give. Whatever damage the house had suffered, this working surface remained ready for use.

"It can be refinished?"

"Sanded and oiled. The marks of use can be erased or preserved, depending on your preference." Katsuhito touched the surface with something approaching affection. "Some people value the evidence of history. Others prefer a fresh start."

---

## SCENE S096: BEDROOM STRUCTURE
**Time:** 08:56:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House bedroom

The bedroom inspection followed the same systematic pattern.

"The oshiire closet shows no water damage." Katsuhito opened the sliding doors and examined the interior. "The futon you found would have rotted if moisture had penetrated here."

Good news. The storage space where he would keep his bedding remained functional and dry.

"The floor shows the same settling pattern as the main room." The old man walked the perimeter, testing each section with his weight. "The north side has sunk slightly. The south side remains level."

The house tilting imperceptibly toward the mountain behind it. The weight of decades pushing against foundations that had held but not perfectly.

"The settlement can be corrected?"

"Adjusted, yes. Corrected entirely, perhaps not. The house has found its position over time. Fighting that completely may create new problems."

---

## SCENE S097: WINDOW CONDITION
**Time:** 08:58:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House bedroom

The bedroom window faced east, catching morning light that was now warming the room.

"The glass is original." Katsuhito examined the window with care. "Hand-blown, with the imperfections that mark authentic period construction. See how the thickness varies?"

He looked closely and saw what the old man indicated. The glass was not perfectly uniform. Areas of greater thickness distorted the view slightly, ripples in the surface catching light at odd angles.

"The seal has failed in places." Katsuhito pointed to gaps where the glazing putty had shrunk away from the frame. "Air enters here. Rain may enter if driven by wind."

Re-glazing, then. Another skill to learn or task to hire. The window would need its seals restored before the rainy season.

"Can this be done without replacing the glass?"

"Yes. Carefully. The original glass is irreplaceable. Modern glass could be substituted, but something would be lost."

---

## SCENE S098: CEILING CHECK
**Time:** 09:00:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House bedroom

The ceiling showed the evidence Katsuhito had been looking for.

"Here." The old man pointed to a discoloration in one corner, a yellowish stain that spread across several ceiling boards. "Water damage from roof leaks. This is what rain does when it finds entry."

He studied the stain, seeing now the pattern of repeated wetting and drying. The wood had absorbed water, swelled, contracted, absorbed again. The stain marked the history of storms that had penetrated defenses meant to keep them out.

"Is the wood damaged beyond repair?"

"Possibly. The boards may need replacement if the damage has reached the structure beneath." Katsuhito's tone was matter-of-fact. "We cannot know without removing them. That is work for after the roof is repaired."

The sequence clarified. Roof first, to stop new water from entering. Then assessment of existing damage. Then repair of what could be saved.

---

## SCENE S099: FLOOR STABILITY
**Time:** 09:02:48 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House bedroom

"Walk the floor systematically."

He followed Katsuhito's instruction, crossing the bedroom in a grid pattern that covered every section. Under his feet, the floor varied from solid to slightly soft, the settling pattern Katsuhito had identified expressing itself in subtle flexion.

"The northwest corner is worst?"

"Yes. The floor there sits lowest, creating a slight bowl shape that the eye cannot detect but the body feels." The old man watched his progress with analytical attention. "Water would pool there if spilled. Dust collects there naturally."

He finished his grid walk and returned to where Katsuhito waited. The assessment had taken perhaps five minutes. In those five minutes, he had learned to feel what he had not known to look for.

"You learn quickly." The observation came without emphasis. Simple fact noted.

---

## SCENE S100: TOILET AREA PLUMBING
**Time:** 09:04:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House toilet area

The toilet area required its own inspection.

"The septic system serving this house was installed in the early twentieth century." Katsuhito crouched near the base of the toilet, examining connections that disappeared into the floor. "Traditional Japanese toilets required different infrastructure than Western fixtures."

He understood. The squat toilet he had been using was original to the house, its ceramic basin showing the patina of age but remaining functional.

"Does the system still work properly?"

"It functioned when tested last month." The old man stood and wiped his hands on his work trousers. "I had the tank emptied and inspected as part of preparing the house for potential occupancy."

The admission revealed something. Katsuhito had been preparing this house before his arrival. The old man had known, or suspected, that someone would come to claim this inheritance.

"You expected me?"

"I expected someone." Katsuhito met his eyes. "The house has stood empty long enough. It was time for new life to enter."
