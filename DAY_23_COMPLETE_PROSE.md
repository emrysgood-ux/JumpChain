**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Shrine (breakfast/sword lesson) → Tsukino House (work) → Shrine (dinner) → Tsukino House  
**Weather:** Clear, 24°C high, 14°C low, warm spring day  
**Sunrise:** 5:19 AM | **Sunset:** 6:45 PM

## SCENE 1: POST-BIRTHDAY MORNING
**Time:** 06:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The day after a birthday carried its own particular quality.

Sheldon woke to ordinary morning sounds—birds, wind, the house's settling—after a day marked by celebration. The contrast felt appropriate. Life couldn't sustain continuous specialness; ordinary days provided the backdrop against which special ones stood out.

Twenty-three days since awakening. One day after Tenchi turned five. Nobuyuki's last full day on the mountain.

---

## SCENE 2: MORNING WALK
**Time:** 07:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from Tsukino House to Shrine

The walk uphill had become meditation.

Three hundred twenty steps waited above, but the approach had become comfortable—muscle memory rather than conscious navigation. Sheldon used the time to organize thoughts, to plan the day's requirements, to prepare for whatever the mountain offered.

Today would bring two significant events: Tenchi's first sword lesson, Nobuyuki's departure preparations. Both carried weight the previous day's celebration had temporarily obscured.

---

## SCENE 3: EAGER STUDENT
**Time:** 07:25:00 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, entrance

Tenchi waited with his wooden sword.

Not at the gate this time—on the training ground behind the main hall, where Katsuhito conducted the shrine's few martial students. The boy held the sword with both hands, stance approximating what he'd likely observed from his grandfather's teaching.

"Sheru-ji! Watch me!"

"I'm watching."

Tenchi swung the sword in a wide arc that would have decapitated any adult standing within three meters. The technique was enthusiastic but entirely wrong—momentum uncontrolled, balance compromised, follow-through nonexistent.

"See? I'm good already!"

"You're certainly energetic."

---

## SCENE 4: BREAKFAST ANTICIPATION
**Time:** 07:40:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

Breakfast proceeded with unusual tension.

Not conflict—anticipation. Tenchi ate quickly, eager to return to his sword. Nobuyuki ate slowly, savoring his last morning meal before the return to Tokyo. Katsuhito ate with characteristic calm, the still point around which others' emotions orbited.

"Training begins after breakfast," the priest said. "Not during. Not before."

"But I'm READY—"

"Readiness includes patience. A swordsman who cannot wait is a swordsman who will be defeated by someone who can."

The lesson landed with visible impact. Tenchi applied himself to his rice with renewed focus, patience practiced through the act of eating.

---

## SCENE 5: THE FIRST LESSON
**Time:** 08:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, training ground

Katsuhito's teaching began with standing.

"Before you can swing a sword, you must know how to stand. Before you can stand correctly, you must understand why standing matters."

Tenchi's disappointment was visible. He'd expected immediate combat instruction, dramatic techniques, the exciting movements he'd imagined. Instead he received a lesson in posture—feet positioned precisely, weight distributed evenly, spine aligned, shoulders relaxed.

"This is standing," the priest said. "Practice it until standing feels natural in this position rather than the positions you've used until now."

"Just... standing?"

"Just standing. The foundation upon which everything else is built."

---

## SCENE 6: WATCHING THE LESSON
**Time:** 09:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

Sheldon observed from the engawa, Nobuyuki beside him.

"Father teaches the way he was taught," Nobuyuki said quietly. "Patience first. Technique second. Combat distant third, if ever."

"That seems wise, for a five-year-old."

"It seems slow. Tenchi wants action. Father offers contemplation." A slight smile. "The tension between them will define his training for years."

On the training ground, Tenchi stood. Just stood. His initial excitement had faded into the determined endurance of someone who understood that this was a test he needed to pass.

---

## SCENE 7: LESSON CONCLUSION
**Time:** 09:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, training ground

The first lesson ended without a single sword swing.

"Tomorrow," Katsuhito said, "you will learn to bow. The day after, you will learn to grip. When those foundations are solid, we will discuss movement."

"How long until I can fight?"

"Fighting is not the goal. Moving correctly is the goal. Fighting is what happens when moving correctly encounters opposition."

Tenchi absorbed this with the expression of someone encountering philosophy beyond their years. The wooden sword hung at his side, unused, its potential unrealized but its presence already teaching.

---

## SCENE 8: HOUSE WORK
**Time:** 10:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Work on the house continued in Yamada's absence.

Takeshi arrived mid-morning with supplies for the day's tasks—trim pieces, fasteners, a small can of finish for the completed sections. The work proceeded with the rhythm they'd established over previous weeks, each task building on the one before.

"The lesson went well?" Takeshi asked as they measured trim.

"Tenchi learned to stand."

"Ah. Katsuhito-sensei's method. My uncle studied with him briefly, years ago. Said it took two weeks before he was permitted to hold a sword."

"Two weeks of standing?"

"Two weeks of foundations. Standing, breathing, walking, sitting. The sword itself was almost incidental."

---

## SCENE 9: LUNCH AT SHRINE
**Time:** 12:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

Lunch carried the weight of approaching departure.

Nobuyuki ate with visible distraction, his attention divided between present meal and future train. Tenchi had recovered from the morning's philosophical lesson, his natural energy reasserting itself despite the exercise in patience.

"When will you come back, tou-san?"

"Golden Week. Less than two weeks."

"That's forever."

"It's twelve days. Twelve days is not forever." Nobuyuki's voice carried gentle correction. "Forever is much longer than twelve days."

"It FEELS like forever."

"Feelings and facts sometimes disagree. Both are valid, but facts don't change based on how we feel about them."

---

## SCENE 10: AFTERNOON WORK
**Time:** 14:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

The afternoon's work focused on finishing trim in the main room.

Takeshi demonstrated techniques for creating seamless joints, the wood pieces meeting at angles that concealed the line between them. Sheldon's hands grew steadier with practice, the skills accumulating through repetition.

"You learn quickly," Takeshi observed.

"I had good teachers."

"Teachers can only offer. Students must receive. Your receiving is efficient."

The compliment carried weight from someone who measured praise carefully.

---

## SCENE 11: DEPARTURE PREPARATION
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, main house

Nobuyuki packed his bags with architectural precision.

Each item had its place, its position optimized for access and weight distribution. The suitcase that had arrived from Tokyo would return to Tokyo, carrying the accumulated small items of a weekend visit—used clothes, photographs taken during the birthday, a drawing Tenchi had made with his new colored pencils.

"These visits are never long enough," Nobuyuki said to Sheldon as they crossed paths in the hallway. "And somehow they're also always enough. The contradiction makes no sense, but there it is."

"Children measure time differently than adults."

"Children measure everything differently. That's both their gift and their limitation."

---

## SCENE 12: FAREWELL DINNER
**Time:** 17:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

The farewell dinner was simpler than the birthday meal but carried its own significance.

Tenchi ate with subdued energy, the approaching departure casting shadow over his usual brightness. He sat closer to his father than usual, as if proximity could delay the separation.

"I'll call when I reach Tokyo," Nobuyuki said. "And we'll speak on weekends. The phone exists for a reason."

"Phones aren't the same as being here."

"No. They're not." Nobuyuki didn't minimize the truth. "But they're what we have. And what we have is better than nothing."

---

## SCENE 13: LAST EVENING
**Time:** 19:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

Father and son sat together on the engawa, watching the sunset paint the mountains.

Sheldon observed from a respectful distance, aware that this moment belonged to them. The conversation was too quiet to overhear, but its content was visible in gestures and expressions—reassurance offered, acceptance received, love expressed in the language of touch and presence.

Katsuhito appeared beside Sheldon without sound. "The hardest part of parenthood is the leaving. Harder even than the staying."

"He carries a lot of guilt."

"Guilt implies wrongdoing. What he carries is grief—for the life he expected, for the wife he lost, for the son he cannot raise daily. Grief and guilt look similar but respond to different remedies."

---

## SCENE 14: BEDTIME RITUAL
**Time:** 20:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, main house

Nobuyuki put his son to bed for the last time this visit.

The ritual was visible through the window as Sheldon walked past—the tucking, the forehead kiss, the lingering presence of a father memorizing his child's sleeping face. Tenchi's wooden sword rested beside his pillow, allowed this one exception to the training equipment's proper storage.

Tomorrow the boy would wake to his grandfather's care. Tonight he fell asleep with his father watching.

---

## SCENE 15: ADULT FAREWELLS
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

"Thank you again," Nobuyuki said to Sheldon. "For being here. For being part of this."

"I didn't do anything special."

"You did everything special. You arrived. You stayed. You became someone Tenchi trusts." The architect's voice carried unusual emotion. "In a family that's lost people, adding someone new is significant. Don't undervalue your presence."

"I won't."

"Good. Because I'm counting on you to help my father with what I can't provide from Tokyo—daily attention, consistent presence, the ordinary care that extraordinary distance makes impossible."

---

## SCENE 16: NOBUYUKI'S CONCERN
**Time:** 20:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

"There's something else," Nobuyuki said, his voice dropping.

"Yes?"

"Watch my son. Not protectively—he needs independence—but attentively. Father has plans for him that I don't fully understand. The sword training is just the beginning."

"Plans?"

"I don't know their shape. I only know they exist. Father has never done anything without purpose, and giving a five-year-old a weapon serves purposes beyond childhood play." Nobuyuki's gaze held Sheldon's. "I'm not asking you to interfere. I'm asking you to pay attention. To notice what I can't see from 500 kilometers away."

"I'll pay attention."

"That's all I can ask."

---

## SCENE 17: WALK HOME
**Time:** 21:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to Tsukino House

The walk home carried new weight.

Nobuyuki's request had been neither unreasonable nor fully explained. *Watch my son. Father has plans.* The words suggested depths to the Masaki family that Sheldon hadn't yet perceived—purposes behind the ordinary surface, meanings encoded in traditions he was still learning.

The wooden sword. The mountain shrine. The priest who moved like something more than an elderly caretaker.

*Pay attention*, Nobuyuki had said. As if attention might reveal what questions hadn't yet been asked.

---

## SCENE 18: EVENING REFLECTION
**Time:** 21:40:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The house held its silence like a held breath.

Sheldon sat in the main room without lighting lamps, letting darkness settle around him. Twenty-three days since awakening, and the questions had only multiplied. Who had brought him here? Why? What purpose did his presence serve in a family that had already existed without him?

And now: What plans did Katsuhito have for his grandson? What depths existed beneath the shrine's peaceful surface?

*Questions are the beginning of understanding*, Dorothy Mae's voice observed. *But some questions lead to answers you might not want.*

---

## SCENE 19: SLEEP PREPARATION
**Time:** 22:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The futon welcomed him with familiar comfort.

Tomorrow Nobuyuki would leave. Tomorrow Tenchi would learn to bow. Tomorrow the house would need continued work, the relationships continued attention, the life continued building.

But tonight Sheldon could lie in darkness and wonder about plans and purposes and the depths of an ordinary-seeming family that had somehow become his own.

---

## SCENE 20: LAST THOUGHTS
**Time:** 22:20:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

Sleep approached like a tide—inevitable, patient, impossible to hurry or delay.

*Watch my son. Father has plans.*

The words echoed as consciousness faded. Tomorrow would bring clarity or continued mystery. Either way, tomorrow would come, carrying Day 24 into existence through the simple mechanism of time's passage.

Twenty-three days complete. Twenty-four approaching. The count continued regardless of questions or answers.
