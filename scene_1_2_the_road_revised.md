## SCENE 1.2: THE ROAD

**April 3, 1989 — 15:20 JST**
**Location:** Path through rice paddies, Okayama Prefecture
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The path between the paddies was barely wide enough for his shoulders.

Sheldon picked his way along the raised earthen ridge that separated one flooded field from the next, his feet finding purchase on ground that generations of farmers had packed solid through daily use. The rice hadn't been planted yet—too early in the season, he realized, the water in the paddies serving some preparatory purpose he didn't fully understand—but the infrastructure was ancient and well-maintained, a network of narrow walkways threading between rectangular pools that caught the afternoon sky like scattered mirrors.

His legs worked. That was the important thing. Whatever reservoir of energy he'd drained with his experiment in the field, the deficit was no longer catastrophic. He could walk, could balance on the uneven path, could put one foot in front of the other without his knees buckling. The exhaustion had settled into something manageable—a heaviness in his limbs, a faint tremor in his hands when he held them still, the particular bone-deep fatigue of a body that had been asked to do something it wasn't prepared for.

He'd felt similar after his first marathon. After the three-day coding sprint that had produced his doctoral thesis simulations. After the night his grandmother died and he'd sat with her body until the funeral home came, unable to sleep, unable to look away, needing to be present for every moment of her absence.

The body knew how to be tired. The body knew how to keep moving anyway.

The paddies stretched around him in irregular patterns, following contours of terrain that predated any concept of efficient land use. Some were large enough to plant a small field of corn; others barely bigger than a parking space, tucked into corners where the slope allowed a few extra square meters of cultivation. The water in each was perfectly still, undisturbed by wind, reflecting clouds and sky with a clarity that made him feel like he was walking between two versions of the same world.

Mountains rose in the distance—not the dramatic peaks of postcard Japan, but older shapes, worn smooth by millennia of weather, covered in forest that looked like it had never been cut. The treeline came down almost to the paddies' edge in places, dark green against the pale spring sky. Birds called from somewhere in that green darkness, sounds he didn't recognize, species that probably didn't exist in Alaska or Georgia or any of the other places he'd lived.

He was really here.

The thought kept arriving, unwelcome and undeniable. Not dreaming. Not hallucinating in the final moments of consciousness as the cascade failure unmade him. Really, physically, materially present in a body that walked and breathed and cast a shadow on the path ahead of him. The evidence accumulated with each step: mud on his shoes, sun warming the back of his neck, the specific ache of muscles recovering from unprecedented strain.

A farmer was visible in one of the distant paddies, bent over some task Sheldon couldn't identify from this distance. The figure was too far away for details—just a shape in work clothes, maybe wearing a conical hat, engaged in labor that had probably looked identical five hundred years ago. The farmer didn't look up as Sheldon passed. Probably hadn't even noticed him, absorbed in whatever agricultural rhythm governed days out here.

The path curved around a larger paddy, following the terrain, and Sheldon's perspective shifted enough to see more of the landscape ahead. The road was closer now—he could make out individual trees along its edge, a wooden utility pole carrying wires toward some unseen destination, the gray-brown surface of packed earth or old asphalt. Another ten minutes of walking, maybe fifteen at his current pace.

His mind kept circling back to the light.

He hadn't imagined it. The soreness in his muscles, the depleted feeling that still dragged at his limbs—those were real, physical consequences of a real, physical event. He had raised his hand and spoken words and something had responded. Energy had moved through him, or out of him, or from somewhere else entirely using him as a conduit. The mechanism didn't matter yet. What mattered was the fact: he had access to something that shouldn't exist.

The name Tsukino. The attack phrase from a children's anime. The warmth he remembered from the space between death and waking. These weren't coincidences. They were data points, pieces of a pattern he couldn't yet see, clues left by whoever or whatever had reconstructed his existence and placed him in this field in this country in this decade.

But he had more than clues now. He had the letter.

Uncle Kiyoshi's words unfolded in his memory, each detail a thread he could pull on, a foundation he could build from. Bell Laboratories. His mother Yuki, gone four years now. The house in Kamogata that had waited for him while he settled her affairs, rented out the Oakland property, arranged for a year away from work. The Yamamoto family watching over the empty building. Fumiko wanting to meet him. August and Obon and the promise of family arriving to check on his progress.

Someone—something—had given him not just documentation but a *story*. A life with texture and depth, with relationships that extended backward in time and forward into obligations he would have to navigate. He wasn't a blank slate dropped into Japan with nothing but forged papers. He was Tsukino Sheldon, returning to claim an inheritance, grieving a mother, taking time to rebuild. The cover story wasn't a cover story at all. It was simply... true. As true as anything could be when reality itself had been rewritten to accommodate his existence.

*Life, family background, and documentation established.*

The presence hadn't lied. It had given him exactly what it promised, in exhaustive detail, down to the worn edges of photographs and the particular creases in letters that suggested years of handling. The question wasn't whether the infrastructure would hold—it would. The question was what he was supposed to do with it.

His grandmother would have had opinions about that.

*Nobody's coming to save you, baby. That's not pessimism—that's just facts. You want something done, you do it yourself. You want help, you earn it by being worth helping.*

The memory surfaced with the particular clarity of oft-repeated wisdom, her voice sharp and warm at the same time, the way she'd sounded when she was teaching him something she considered essential. She'd never had patience for waiting, for passivity, for the assumption that the universe owed anyone anything. You worked. You prepared. You made yourself capable of handling whatever came, and then when it came, you handled it.

The presence that had saved him—whatever it was, wherever it had gone—had given him the tools. The rest was up to him.

Sheldon kept walking.

The paddies began to give way to other forms of agriculture as he approached the road. Vegetable gardens, maybe, or the early stages of orchards—he could see rows of small trees, their branches still bare or just beginning to bud, arranged with the geometric precision that suggested human cultivation rather than natural growth. A shed appeared at the edge of one field, its wooden walls weathered to silver-gray, farming implements visible through the open door. Everything looked functional and well-used, maintained by hands that understood the value of tools.

The road, when he finally reached it, was narrower than he'd expected.

Two lanes, barely. Asphalt that had seen better decades, its surface cracked and patched in patterns that told a story of limited municipal budgets and harsh winters. No sidewalk—the road simply ended at its edges, giving way to drainage ditches and then the agricultural land beyond. A utility pole stood nearby, wires humming faintly with electricity, connecting this rural nowhere to a grid that probably hadn't changed much since the 1960s.

He stood at the road's edge and looked both directions.

To his left, the road curved around a forested hill and disappeared. To his right, it ran relatively straight for several hundred meters before dipping into what might be a small valley, buildings barely visible in the distance—a cluster of structures that could be a village. Kamogata. The letter had mentioned the name, the village where the family house waited, where the Yamamoto family had been keeping watch. Those distant buildings might be his destination, or might be somewhere else entirely. Without a map, without landmarks he recognized from a life he hadn't actually lived, he had no way to orient himself except by asking someone who knew the area.

The logical approach was exactly that. Ask someone.

He was in rural Japan in 1989. Before smartphones, before GPS, before the assumption that any question could be answered by consulting a device in your pocket. People here navigated by asking other people, by knowing their neighbors, by maintaining the kind of social infrastructure that cities had largely abandoned. If he wanted to find the address on his documentation, he would have to talk to someone who knew the area.

The thought was less daunting than it should have been.

He'd lived in Japan before—years in Kyoto, working on projects that required daily interaction with colleagues and shopkeepers and the various functionaries of academic life. His Japanese was fluent, had been even before whatever process had reconstructed him, and he'd always been comfortable navigating cultural expectations that confused other foreigners. The language wouldn't be a barrier.

And he had a story now—a real one, or real enough. A physicist from America, taking sabbatical after years of demanding work, coming to claim the house his great-aunt had left him. Just arrived, still getting his bearings, needing directions to the village his family had come from. The letter had given him everything he needed: names, context, the shape of a life he could step into. All he had to do was present himself as who the documents said he was.

That part, at least, wasn't a lie. He *was* Tsukino Sheldon, whatever that meant. The name was on his registration card, his bankbooks, his property deed. The family existed—Uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka, cousin Fumiko with her children, the web of relations documented in the koseki. Whether those relationships had been built over decades or conjured into being by something that spoke in chimes and starlight, they were real now. Real enough to build on.

A sound reached him from his right—mechanical, rhythmic, approaching. An engine of some kind, not the high whine of a motorcycle but the deeper rumble of something larger. A truck, maybe, or an old car. Coming from the direction of the village.

Sheldon stepped back from the road's edge, positioning himself clearly on the verge where he'd be visible to any approaching driver. His exhaustion was still present but manageable, and he'd recovered enough to stand without swaying, to present himself as someone who needed assistance rather than someone who needed rescue.

The vehicle came around a bend in the road and resolved into shape: a small truck, white and rust-spotted, the kind of practical working vehicle that farmers the world over seemed to favor. It was moving slowly, in no particular hurry, the driver presumably familiar enough with this road to know there was rarely reason to rush.

The letter had mentioned a family watching the house. *Yamamoto*, his uncle had written. Sheldon wondered if this might be one of them—if the infrastructure of care his benefactor had built extended even to chance encounters on rural roads. Or maybe it was just a farmer heading home, unconnected to anything, willing to help a stranger because that's what people did out here.

Either way, he needed directions. Either way, he was about to have his first real conversation in this new life.

Sheldon raised his hand. Not a wave, exactly—more of an acknowledgment, a signal that he was present and would appreciate attention. The gesture felt natural, the universal language of someone who needed help and was willing to ask for it politely.

The truck began to slow.
