# SON OF COSMOS: JUMPCHAIN
## Scene 1.4: The Ascent

**April 3, 1989 — ~15:50 JST**
**Location:** Bus → Masaki Shrine
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

The bus was old—probably older than Sheldon had been in his previous life—with wooden floors worn smooth and seats upholstered in faded green vinyl. It rattled and wheezed up the mountain road like an elderly animal that had made this journey so many times it could do it in its sleep.

The final stop came perhaps ten minutes later. The driver called out "Masaki Shrine" without looking back, and Sheldon made his way to the front of the bus on legs that felt steadier than they had any right to.

He stepped off into a small clearing—barely larger than the bus itself—where the road ended at a traditional wooden torii gate. The gate was old, its red paint faded but still visible, its posts thick with the accumulated patience of centuries. Beyond it, a stone path led into the trees.

And rising from the trees, disappearing up the mountainside in a gray ribbon: stairs. Hundreds of them.

Sheldon counted as he approached the first step. He had a physicist's relationship with numbers—they were the language he used to understand the world, and he couldn't help translating everything into quantities and measurements. The stairs rose at perhaps a thirty-degree angle, each step worn smooth in the center from generations of feet.

He began to climb.

---

Three hundred twenty steps.

He counted them all.

Not because he needed to—the number was irrelevant, practically speaking—but because the counting gave him something to focus on besides the impossibility of what was happening. His legs should have started burning by step fifty. His breath should have grown ragged by step one hundred. His heart should have been pounding in his chest by step two hundred.

None of those things happened.

He climbed the way the body of a young athlete would climb: steady, rhythmic, his breathing slightly deeper but never labored. The muscles in his legs worked without complaint. His joints articulated smoothly. By the time he reached step two hundred, he wasn't even perspiring.

*This is wrong.*

The thought kept surfacing, insistent and unwelcome. He was a man who had died less than an hour ago—or whatever the appropriate verb was for his situation—and now he was climbing three hundred twenty stone steps in rural Japan and his body was responding as if this were a casual stroll through a parking lot.

He had been thirty-seven. He had been out of shape. He had been the kind of person who got winded climbing two flights of stairs to his office because the elevator was broken.

Whatever he was now, he wasn't that person anymore.

The trees opened suddenly at step three hundred eighteen, and Sheldon stopped.

The shrine grounds spread before him in a carefully maintained clearing. Traditional buildings in dark wood and white walls. Stone lanterns flanking the paths. A main hall with its distinctive curved roof, a smaller office building to one side, what might have been a residence in the back.

But none of those things were what made him stop.

At the center of the courtyard, rising from a bed of carefully raked gravel, stood a tree.

It was massive—trunk wider than Sheldon could have wrapped his arms around, branches spreading outward and upward in a crown that seemed to catch the late afternoon light and hold it. The bark was textured in a way he didn't recognize, neither the smooth gray of beech nor the rough channels of oak. The leaves were a deep green that seemed almost to glow in the sunlight.

And the tree was watching him.

Sheldon knew this the way he knew the sun was setting and the air was cooling and his body wasn't his body anymore. It wasn't a metaphor or a trick of perception. The tree—this specific tree, this ancient presence at the center of this ancient shrine—was aware of his arrival. Its attention rested on him like a hand on his shoulder, heavy and deliberate.

He stood frozen on the final step, his breath suddenly caught in his chest.

*Trees don't watch people.*

But even as he thought it, he knew it wasn't quite true. There were things in the world that science hadn't explained yet. There were phenomena that didn't fit neatly into the categories he'd been trained to use. He had spent his entire career pushing at the edges of what was known, and he knew—had always known—that the universe contained more than his models could describe.

He just hadn't expected to encounter it here, in the courtyard of a mountain shrine, in a body that wasn't his, on a day that shouldn't exist.

Sheldon took a breath and stepped onto the shrine grounds.

The tree's attention followed him, patient and silent, as he walked toward the main buildings.
