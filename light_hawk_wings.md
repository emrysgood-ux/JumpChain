# LIGHT HAWK WINGS
## Tenchi Universe Power System
### Son of Cosmos: JumpChain

## DEFINITION

Light Hawk Wings (LHW) are the ultimate defensive and offensive power in the Tenchi Muyo universe. They represent direct connection to the Chousin goddesses' power.

---

## SOURCE

### The Chousin
Three sister goddesses who created the 22-dimensional universe:
- **Washu** — Goddess of wisdom/science
- **Tsunami** — Goddess of life/trees
- **Tokimi** — Goddess of necessity

### Power Flow

## WING COUNTS

| Entity | Wings | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Tsunami | 10 | Goddess-level maximum |
| Tenchi (transcended) | 10+ | Exceeds goddesses briefly |
| Z | 5 | OVA 3 antagonist |
| 1st Gen Treeships | 3 | Ship-mounted |
| 2nd Gen Treeships | 3 | Requires override |
| 3rd Gen Treeships | 1 | Two ships paired |
| **Yosho** | **0** | Uses barriers through Funaho |
| **Sheldon** | **0** | Lambda, not LHW |

---

## FUNCTIONS

### Defensive
- Absolute protection against attacks
- Each wing can absorb one ship-destroying attack
- Regenerates over minutes if destroyed
- Directional (vulnerable from unprotected angles)

### Offensive
- Energy projection beams
- Cannot be defended except by equal shields
- Planetary-scale bombardment possible
- Devastating in combat

### Utility
- Energy-mass conversion
- Armor generation
- Blade creation (Planck-length edges)
- Reality manipulation (high wing counts)

---

## SHIP-MOUNTED LHW

### 1st Generation Trees
- Generate 3 wings
- Full offensive/defensive capability
- Can fire without override
- Example: Funaho (Yosho's tree)

### 2nd Generation Trees
- Generate 3 wings
- Require 1st Gen override for offense
- Full defensive capability
- Example: Ryu-Oh (Ayeka's tree)

### 3rd Generation Trees
- Generate 1 wing per ship
- Must pair with another 3rd Gen
- Limited capability
- Bulk of Juraian fleet

---

## CRITICAL CANON CORRECTION

### Yosho Does NOT Generate LHW

> **Kajishima explicitly confirmed:** Yosho cannot generate Light Hawk Wings independently. What appeared as LHW in anime was defensive barriers channeled through his bond with Funaho.

### Why This Matters
- Yosho is powerful but not transcendent
- His strength is skill, not cosmic power
- Funaho provides support, not LHW generation
- Distinguishes him from Tenchi's potential

---

## TENCHI'S POTENTIAL

### Current State (1989)
- Age 4-5
- No manifestation
- Potential dormant
- Completely ordinary child

### Canon Awakening (Year 13+)
- First wing during Kagato fight
- Progressive increase through series
- Eventually exceeds 10 wings
- Transcends even Chousin briefly

### Story Implication
Tenchi's potential is unchanged by Sheldon's presence. The found family transforms context, not capability.

## LAMBDA VS. LHW

| Aspect | Lambda | Light Hawk Wings |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Source | Galaxy Cauldron | Chousin/Tsunami |
| Universe | Sailor Moon | Tenchi Muyo |
| Nature | Nurturing, creative | Combat, transcendent |
| Feel | Warm, golden | Electric, crystalline |
| Combat | Defensive only | Full offense/defense |
| Users | Cosmos, Sheldon | Tenchi, Trees, Chousin |

### Incompatibility
These systems don't interface. Sheldon has Lambda; he cannot generate LHW. They exist in parallel, not synthesis.

---

## STORY IMPLICATIONS

### What Sheldon Can't Do
- Generate any Light Hawk Wings
- Bond with Royal Trees
- Access Juraian power systems
- Compete at cosmic combat level

### What This Means
- He's not the fighter
- His role is nurturing, not battling
- Complements rather than competes with Tenchi
- Different kind of strength
