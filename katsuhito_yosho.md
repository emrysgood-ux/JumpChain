## VITAL STATISTICS

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|

| **Apparent Age** | ~70s (illusion barrier) |
| **True Appearance** | ~20s-30s, youthful adult |
| **True Hair** | Purple/silver |
| **True Eyes** | Purple |
| **Height** | Tall, athletic build |
| **Voice** | Measured, warm, occasionally cryptic |

**Aging Note:** Juraian royals bonded to 1st-generation trees can live for thousands of years. Yosho's longevity comes from his Funaho bond, body enhancement, and power from Ryoko's gems. See `[[canon/juraian_aging.md]]` for full system.

## HERITAGE

| Relation | Person | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Father** | Emperor Azusa Masaki Jurai | Current ruler of Jurai |
| **Mother** | Empress Funaho | First Empress; of EARTH descent |
| **Half-Sister** | Ayeka Masaki Jurai | Same father, mother is Misaki |
| **Half-Sister** | Sasami Masaki Jurai | Same father, mother is Misaki |

**The "Half-Breed" Factor:**
- Funaho was an Earthling (descended from ancient Juraian colonists)
- Yosho faced discrimination on Jurai for his mixed heritage
- Ironic: His "impure" blood actually made him stronger
- This prejudice contributed to his decision to leave

---

## ROYAL TREE

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Funaho-no-ki |
| **Generation** | 1st Generation (direct Tsunami offspring) |
| **Status** | Rooted on Earth near shrine |
| **Condition** | Cannot transform to ship form (damaged in crash) |
| **Power Source** | Ryoko's three gems embedded in Tenchi-ken |

**Critical Canon Note:**
> Yosho generates BARRIERS through Funaho, NOT Light Hawk Wings. Kajishima explicitly confirmed this. What appeared as LHW was defensive barriers channeled through his tree bond.

## CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY

### On Jurai (~500 BCE - ~1292 CE equivalent)
- Born to Azusa and Funaho approximately 1,500 years ago
- Bonded with 1st-generation Royal Tree Funaho at young age (~8 years)
- Trained extensively; became greatest swordsman in Jurai's history
- Faced social prejudice for Earthling heritage
- Secretly fell in love with Airi (forbidden—her people despised Jurai)
- Engaged to half-sister Ayeka (political arrangement he didn't want)
- Felt trapped by court life and expectations
- Already ~800 years old by time of Ryoko's attack

### The Attack on Jurai (~1292 CE)
- Kagato sent mind-controlled Ryoko to attack
- Young Sasami mortally wounded; assimilated by Tsunami
- Yosho volunteered to pursue Ryoko
- This was partly heroic duty, partly escape from suffocating life

### Battle on Earth (~1292 CE)
- Pursued Ryoko across space to Earth
- Engaged her in combat near mountain (future shrine site)
- **Battle Method**: Used Funaho (ship) and **BARRIERS** (NOT Light Hawk Wings) to counter her (Kajishima confirmed)
- Victory: Removed her three power gems
- Embedded gems in his sword (Tenchi-ken)
- Sealed Ryoko in cave beneath what would become the shrine lake
- Ship Funaho crashed and took root (cannot transform)

### Establishing Earth Life (~1292-1300 CE)
- Rescued cousin Kasumi from crash wreckage
- Took the name "Katsuhito Masaki"
- Married Kasumi; established Masaki family line
- Built Masaki Shrine on the mountain
- Let Jurai believe he died in pursuit

### The Centuries (~1300-1900 CE)
- Watched generations of descendants live and die
- Maintained shrine traditions
- Secretly contacted galactic affairs via Lady Seto
- Eventually began relationship with Airi
- Had daughters Kiyone and Minaho Masaki with Airi

### Recent History (1900-1989)
- Daughter Kiyone married descendant Nobuyuki
- Tennyo born ~1909
- Tenchi born April 24, 1984
- Kiyone died ~1988 (age ~248, senility)
- Now focuses on preparing Tenchi

## MARRIAGES & CHILDREN

### Pre-Kasumi Marriages
**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q29

> "Yousho has been on Earth for 700 years since he sealed Ryoko in the shrine. It is not surprising that he had SEVERAL WIVES before and Nobuyuki is a descendant of one of his children by one of these wives. So the similarity is genetic."

**Key Points:**
- Kasumi was NOT Yosho's only Earth wife
- He had "several" wives over the 700-year period
- Children from these earlier marriages exist
- Nobuyuki's line descends from one of these earlier unions
- This explains the physical resemblance between Nobuyuki and Katsuhito

### Marriage: Kasumi
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Wife** | Kasumi (Funaho's niece, Yosho's cousin) |
| **Relation** | Rescued during Ryoko battle |
| **Duration** | ~100 years together |
| **Children** | 3 children with Yosho |
| **Status** | Deceased at age 138 |

Kasumi convinced Yosho their children shouldn't be forced to live extended lives if confined on Earth. She initially received life-extension treatment but became disturbed outliving normal Earthlings, requested it stopped, and died naturally. Yosho honored her wish.

**After Kasumi:** Yosho gave subsequent descendants the choice regarding bio-enhancement.

### Marriage: Airi
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Wife** | Airi Masaki (common law marriage) |
| **Status** | Living; Director of Galaxy Academy |
| **Heritage** | Airaian (people who despised Jurai) |
| **Children** | Minaho Masaki, Kiyone Masaki |

Politically sensitive—if the Jurai-Airai hostilities became public, major scandal. Lady Seto assisted with arrangements.

## THE 700-YEAR PLAN

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q20

Yosho has been executing a deliberate, centuries-long strategy regarding Tenchi and the sealed Ryoko. The 101 Secrets source explicitly calls him "a tactician."

### The Strategy Components

1. **Cultivated Tenchi's Curiosity**
   - Made Tenchi interested in the demon/cave "ever since childhood"
   - Told deliberate stories about the "sleeping demon"
   - Created mystery and forbidden-fruit allure

2. **Kiyone's Involvement**
   - Tenchi's mother Kiyone actively helped Yosho cultivate this interest
   - She was a knowing participant in the plan
   - Her involvement was NOT accidental

3. **Awareness of Ryoko's Surveillance**
   - Yosho KNEW that Ryoko's astral body was watching Tenchi constantly
   - He positioned her seal so she could project to the cave entrance
   - He understood she was observing Tenchi since childhood
   - Tenchi himself did not realize he was being watched

4. **Ultimate Goal**
   - Wanted Tenchi to break the seal
   - Wanted Tenchi to use the Tree (Funaho) to attract Aeka
   - "He felt something special about Tenchi and wanted him to be Emperor of Jurai in the future"

### Full Q20 Text
> "His grandfather's fault. He fell in his grandfather's trap - Yosho made Tenchi interested in the demon ever since childhood, with help of Tenchi's mother. He is a tactician and knew Ryoko was watching Tenchi all the time. He arranged so that Tenchi would break the seal and use the Tree to attract Aeka. He felt something special about Tenchi and wanted him to be Emperor of Jurai."

**Story Implication:** Sheldon's arrival in April 1989 introduces an unknown variable into a plan that has been 700 years in the making. Yosho, "a tactician," will need to adapt.

## YOSHO'S POLITICAL CONNECTIONS

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q32

> "Also he has got his way deep into Japanese politics in the last 700 years, so that he can change the family register."

**Implications:**
- Yosho has significant influence in Japanese bureaucracy
- He can manipulate official documentation
- This explains how he maintains identity continuity over centuries
- He has connections at high levels of government
- This could potentially affect Sheldon's documentation situation

---

## YOSHO'S DISGUISE

**Source:** Multiple (confirmed by Kajishima)

Yosho's aged appearance is:
- An illusion/simulation created through his tree bond
- A simulation of his FUTURE appearance (Kajishima specified this)
- NOT borrowed from someone else
- Arranged with Tsunami's assistance so he could live on Earth without arousing suspicion

His true form (young appearance) is shown only to select individuals such as his mother Funaho.

---

## CURRENT STATUS (April 1989)

### Daily Routine

**Morning:**
- Rise before dawn for purification rituals (harae)
- Prepare shinsen (offerings) for the kami
- Open shrine for daily worship
- Sweep the 320 stone steps

**Afternoon:**
- Maintain shrine buildings and grounds
- Conduct ceremonies for visitors
- Tend to Funaho tree (appears to be caring for ancient tree)
- Sell omamori, ema, and ofuda

**Evening:**
- Train Tenchi in "family swordsmanship" during visits
- Read, meditate, communicate with galactic contacts
- Monitor Ryoko's sealed state

### The Sealed Ryoko

Yosho's deliberate plan: he positioned Ryoko's prison so she could project an astral body to the cave entrance. For 700 years, she has watched the Masaki family—and for 5 years, she has watched Tenchi specifically. 

**This was intentional psychological rehabilitation:** By experiencing normal childhood through observation, her damaged psyche would heal.

He tells Tenchi stories about the "sleeping demon," deliberately stoking the boy's curiosity. He knows Tenchi will eventually steal the keys and enter the cave. This is not a failure of security—**it's the plan.**

## PERSONALITY

### The Mask of Katsuhito

What the mask taught him (per his own words):
- Patience
- Humility
- The value of small kindnesses
- What it means to be ordinary
- How to experience life as regular people do

> "On Jurai, I was important. Powerful. Everyone deferred to me. Here, I was an old man with a broom, sweeping leaves and blessing children and trying to keep the roof from leaking."

> "I needed to be unimportant for a while. To experience life as ordinary people experience it. Katsuhito gave me that."

> "Masks shape the wearer as much as the wearer shapes them."

### Current State (1989)
- Deeply lonely beneath stoic composure
- 700 years is a long time to wait alone
- Tenchi provides purpose but also reminds him of mortality
- Ready for something new, though he wouldn't admit it

### When Sheldon Arrives

**What Yosho Senses:**
- Lambda signature suggests cosmic origin
- Something familiar in the energy pattern
- Can't place it—Tsunami? Tokimi? Something else?
- First truly anomalous thing in decades

**His Response:**
- Curiosity: What IS this person?
- Caution: Could be threat or opportunity
- Protection instinct: Tenchi is nearby; must evaluate
- Decision: Invite in, observe, test

> This is the beginning of the most important relationship of both their lives. Neither knows it yet.
