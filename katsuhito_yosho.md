## HERITAGE

| Relation | Person | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Father** | Emperor Azusa Masaki Jurai | Current ruler of Jurai |
| **Mother** | Empress Funaho | First Empress; of EARTH descent |
| **Half-Sister** | Ayeka Masaki Jurai | Same father, mother is Misaki |
| **Half-Sister** | Sasami Masaki Jurai | Same father, mother is Misaki |

**The "Half-Breed" Factor:**
- Funaho was an Earthling (descended from ancient Juraian colonists)
- Yosho faced discrimination on Jurai for his mixed heritage
- Ironic: His "impure" blood actually made him stronger
- This prejudice contributed to his decision to leave

## ROYAL TREE

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Funaho-no-ki |
| **Generation** | 1st Generation (direct Tsunami offspring) |
| **Status** | Rooted on Earth near shrine |
| **Condition** | Cannot transform to ship form (damaged in crash) |
| **Power Source** | Ryoko's three gems embedded in Tenchi-ken |

**Critical Canon Note:**
> Yosho generates BARRIERS through Funaho, NOT Light Hawk Wings. Kajishima explicitly confirmed this. What appeared as LHW was defensive barriers channeled through his tree bond.

## CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY

### On Jurai (~500 BCE - ~1292 CE equivalent)
- Born to Azusa and Funaho approximately 1,500 years ago
- Bonded with 1st-generation Royal Tree Funaho at young age (~8 years)
- Trained extensively; became greatest swordsman in Jurai's history

- Already ~800 years old by time of Ryoko's attack

### The Attack on Jurai (~1292 CE)

- Young Sasami fatally injured; assimilated by Tsunami
- Yosho volunteered to pursue Ryoko
- This was partly heroic duty, partly escape from suffocating life

### Battle on Earth (~1292 CE)

- Engaged her in combat near mountain (future shrine site)
- Victory: Removed her three power gems
- Embedded gems in his sword (Tenchi-ken)
- Sealed Ryoko in cave beneath what would become the shrine lake
- Ship Funaho crashed and took root (cannot transform)

### Establishing Earth Life (~1292-1300 CE)
- Rescued cousin Kasumi from crash wreckage
- Took the name "Katsuhito Masaki"
- Married Kasumi; established Masaki family line
- Built Masaki Shrine on the mountain
- Let Jurai believe he died in pursuit

## MARRIAGES & CHILDREN

### First Marriage: Kasumi
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Wife** | Kasumi (Funaho's niece, Yosho's cousin) |
| **Status** | Deceased at age 138 |
| **Children** | Multiple (descendants include Nobuyuki line) |

Kasumi convinced Yosho their children shouldn't be forced to live extended lives if confined on Earth. She initially received life-extension but became disturbed outliving normal Earthlings, requested it stopped, and died naturally.

### Second Marriage: Airi
| Attribute | Value |

| **Status** | Living; Director of Galaxy Academy |
| **Heritage** | Airaian (people who despised Jurai) |

Politically sensitive—if the Jurai-Airai hostilities became public, major scandal. Lady Seto assisted with arrangements.

## CURRENT STATUS (April 1989)

### Daily Routine

**Morning:**
- Rise before dawn for purification rituals (harae)
- Prepare shinsen (offerings) for the kami
- Open shrine for daily worship
- Sweep the 320 stone steps

**Afternoon:**
- Maintain shrine buildings and grounds
- Conduct ceremonies for visitors
- Tend to Funaho tree (appears to be caring for ancient tree)
- Sell omamori, ema, and ofuda

**Evening:**
- Train Tenchi in "family swordsmanship" during visits
- Read, meditate, communicate with galactic contacts
- Monitor Ryoko's sealed state

### The Sealed Ryoko

Yosho's deliberate plan: he positioned Ryoko's prison so she could project an astral body to the cave entrance. For 700 years, she has watched the Masaki family—and for 5 years, she has watched Tenchi specifically. 

**This was intentional psychological rehabilitation:** By experiencing normal childhood through observation, her damaged psyche would heal.

He tells Tenchi stories about the "sleeping demon," deliberately stoking the boy's curiosity. He knows Tenchi will eventually steal the keys and enter the cave. This is not a failure of security—**it's the plan.**

## PERSONALITY

### The Mask of Katsuhito

What the mask taught him (per his own words):
- Patience
- Humility
- The value of small kindnesses
- What it means to be ordinary
- How to experience life as regular people do

> "On Jurai, I was important. Powerful. Everyone deferred to me. Here, I was an old man with a broom, sweeping leaves and blessing children and trying to keep the roof from leaking."

> "I needed to be unimportant for a while. To experience life as ordinary people experience it. Katsuhito gave me that."

> "Masks shape the wearer as much as the wearer shapes them."

### Current State (1989)
- Deeply lonely beneath stoic composure
- 700 years is a long time to wait alone
- Tenchi provides purpose but also reminds him of mortality
- Ready for something new, though he wouldn't admit it

### When Sheldon Arrives

**What Yosho Senses:**
- Lambda signature suggests cosmic origin
- Something familiar in the energy pattern
- Can't place it—Tsunami? Tokimi? Something else?
- First truly anomalous thing in decades

**His Response:**
- Curiosity: What IS this person?
- Caution: Could be threat or opportunity
- Protection instinct: Tenchi is nearby; must evaluate
- Decision: Invite in, observe, test

> This is the beginning of the most important relationship of both their lives. Neither knows it yet.
