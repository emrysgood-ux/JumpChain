### Heritage & Family Position

**Complex Lineage:**
- **Descendant of Yosho** through Yosho's first wife Kasumi (a niece of Empress Funaho)
- **Son-in-law to Yosho** through marriage to Kiyone (Yosho's daughter with Airi)
- Therefore both Yosho's descendant AND his son-in-law

## STORY IMPLICATIONS

### Present in 1989 (Year 1)

| Character | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Nobuyuki | Widowed, ~120 years old | City (weekends at shrine) |
| Rea | Helper, not yet wife | Okayama area |
| Tenchi | 4 years old (turns 5 April 24) | Masaki Shrine |
| Kiyone | DECEASED (~1988) | N/A |
| Tennyo | Left Earth | Off-world |
| Minaho | Working | Galaxy Academy |
| Airi | Working | Galaxy Academy |
| Kenshi | NOT BORN | N/A |

### Key Narrative Points

1. **Nobuyuki's grief** is fresh (Kiyone died ~1988)
2. **Rea's presence** provides continuity for young Tenchi
3. **The "fictitious death story"** - Tenchi believes a fake version of how his mother died
4. **Tennyo's absence** - She's gone and won't return for 12+ years
5. **Family secrets** - Tenchi doesn't know about Juraian heritage, Tennyo's existence, etc.

### Sheldon's Potential Interactions

- **With Nobuyuki:** Fellow adult male; weekend visits to shrine; shared grief (Sheldon lost his previous life)
- **With Rea:** Kitchen companions; both "outsiders" who became family
- **With Tenchi:** Primary relationship; filling mother-figure/uncle role
- **Re: Kiyone:** Her cooking legacy continues through Rea and eventually Sheldon
