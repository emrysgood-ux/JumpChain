# SCENE 5.1: Fifth Dawn

**Date:** April 7, 1989 (Friday)  
**Time:** 05:30 - 06:15  
**Location:** Guest room → Kitchen  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 900

Five days.

Sheldon's eyes opened to the grey line beneath the shutter, and his body moved without consultation—rising, dressing, orienting itself toward the kitchen with the automatic certainty of established routine. Five days since he had awakened in this existence, and already the strangeness had worn smooth, polished by repetition into something approaching normalcy.

The squeaky door announced him. The hallway waited in its familiar darkness. The kitchen glowed with early light and the presence of a girl who had learned to make the most of every minute.

Rea stood at the counter, her movements swift and precise. She had already prepared rice, set out ingredients for miso soup, arranged pickles on their designated plates. The efficiency was remarkable—and today, Sheldon noticed, it carried an edge.

"Good morning," he said.

"Good morning." She didn't pause in her work. "Tea is ready."

He moved to the pot, poured for both of them, set her cup within easy reach. The ritual had become wordless, each step anticipated before it was taken.

"Tomorrow," Rea said, still not looking at him.

"Nobuyuki."

"Yes." Her knife moved through vegetables with unnecessary precision. "He takes the early train. Arrives around nine."

"Katsuhito mentioned."

"Then you know." She set down the knife, finally meeting his eyes. Something moved in her expression—not quite fear, not quite anticipation. Something more complicated. "He will have opinions. About you. About this." She gestured vaguely at the space between them. "About whether things have been done correctly."

"Things?"

"The household. Tenchi. The way we have managed." Her voice carried no emotion, but her hands had gone still. "He does not think we manage well without Kiyone-sama. He has said so."

The information landed with weight. Nobuyuki's visits weren't just homecomings—they were inspections. Assessments of whether the shrine household was caring adequately for his son.

"And now there's a stranger living in the guest room," Sheldon said.

"Yes. A stranger from America who claims to be family." Rea's eyes were steady. "He will want to know why you are here. What you want. Whether you are safe."

"Those seem like reasonable questions."

"They are. I am not saying he is wrong to ask them." She picked up her knife again, resuming her work. "I am saying you should be prepared to answer."

Sheldon absorbed this. The warning was clear: tomorrow was not a simple meeting. It was a test, an evaluation, a determination of whether Sheldon belonged or whether his presence was a threat.

"Thank you," he said. "For telling me."

Rea nodded once, the conversation concluded. The morning continued, the kitchen filling with the scents of breakfast, the household preparing for another day.

But beneath the routine, something had shifted. The countdown had entered its final hours. Tomorrow, everything would be judged.

## Scene 5.2: Morning Departures

**Time:** 06:15 - 07:45

Breakfast carried the particular energy of anticipation.

Tenchi vibrated with barely contained excitement, his chopsticks moving between bites with the restless rhythm of a child who couldn't quite believe tomorrow would actually arrive.

"One more sleep," he announced for the third time. "Just one more sleep and then Daddy comes."

"Yes," Katsuhito said, his voice patient. "One more sleep."

"And he's going to meet Uncle Sheldon. And I'm going to tell him how Uncle Sheldon tells stories and helps with the cleaning and is fixing the scary house." Tenchi beamed across the table. "He's going to like you. I decided."

"I appreciate the endorsement," Sheldon said.

"What's an endorsement?"

"It means you're on my side."

"Oh." Tenchi considered this. "Yes. I'm on your side. And Grandpa's side. And Rea-nee's side. And Daddy's side. I'm on everybody's side."

"That's a lot of sides."

"I have a big heart." Tenchi said this with the absolute certainty of a child quoting an adult's words. "That's what Mommy said."

The table went briefly quiet. Even Rea's efficient movements paused for a moment before resuming.

"She was right," Katsuhito said. "Your heart is very big."

The morning continued. Rea finished first, rising to clear her dishes and gather her school things. The navy uniform was crisp, her hair pulled back in its usual severe style, her bag heavy with books.

"Tanaka-san arrives at eight," she said, addressing Katsuhito but including Sheldon in her glance. "I left lunch in the usual place. There's extra rice if he needs feeding."

"He brings his own," Katsuhito said. "But thank you."

Rea nodded and moved toward the door. At the threshold, she paused, looking back at Sheldon.

"Work safely," she said. "Roof work is dangerous."

Then she was gone, her footsteps quick on the shrine steps, disappearing into the morning.

Tenchi's departure came next—the yellow hat, the overstuffed randoseru, the fierce hug around Sheldon's legs that had become as much a part of morning as the sunrise itself.

"I'll be back before Daddy gets here," he said earnestly. "Don't let him come while I'm at school."

"He's coming tomorrow, Tenchi. Not today."

"Oh." A brief recalibration. "Okay. But be here when I get back."

"I promise."

The child bounded down the stairs, his energy inexhaustible, his faith absolute. Sheldon watched until the yellow hat disappeared around the first turn, then turned to find Katsuhito watching him with something like amusement.

"You have been thoroughly claimed," the old man said.

"So it seems."

"It is not a small thing. Tenchi's trust is given completely or not at all." Katsuhito moved toward the residence. "Come. We should prepare for Tanaka. He values punctuality above most virtues."

## Scene 5.3: Tanaka Arrives

**Time:** 08:00 - 09:00

The sound of an engine climbing the mountain road announced Tanaka before his truck came into view.

It was an old vehicle—a Datsun of uncertain vintage, its bed loaded with tiles and timber and tools. The man who emerged from the cab matched his transport: weathered, practical, built for endurance rather than speed. His face was a map of years spent working outdoors, lines carved by sun and wind and the particular squint of someone who spent his life assessing structures.

"Masaki-san." He bowed to Katsuhito with the respect due a shrine keeper. "Tsukino-san." A shorter bow to Sheldon, evaluating.

"Tanaka-san," Katsuhito returned. "Thank you for coming."

"Roof needed doing two years ago. Better late than never." Tanaka's voice was gruff but not unkind. "You're the nephew, then. The one from America."

"I am."

"Hm." The evaluating look continued. "You look like the photos. Around the eyes."

Sheldon felt something shift—another confirmation that his appearance matched the fabricated history, that whoever had placed him here had done so with attention to detail.

"I'm told I take after my... father's side."

"James Carter. I met him once. Quiet man. Good with his hands." Tanaka turned back to his truck. "Let's see if you inherited that much."

They walked down to the Tsukino house together, Tanaka leading with the certainty of someone who had traveled this path hundreds of times. He pointed out details as they descended—a section of steps that needed regrading, a drainage channel that would overflow in heavy rain, the places where the forest was encroaching on the path.

"Mountain maintenance never ends," he observed. "You fix one thing, two more need attention. It's the nature of living in high places."

"Sounds like science," Sheldon said.

"Does it?"

"Every answer opens more questions. Every solution reveals more problems."

Tanaka glanced at him—the first sign of genuine interest. "You're educated, then. Michiko-san said her nephew was a scholar."

"I was. I am." The verb tenses tangled in Sheldon's mind. "Physics, mostly. The theoretical kind."

"Not much call for that around here."

"No. But there's call for people who can learn. Who can work."

"Hm." Another evaluating sound. "We'll see."

The house came into view, its roof damage clearly visible in the morning light. The section Sheldon had been warned about—the northeast corner—showed bare timber where tiles had fallen away, water stains marking the path of rain into the structure beneath.

Tanaka studied it for a long moment, then nodded.

"Could be worse. The beam isn't rotted through—your grandfather's maintenance prevented that." He turned to Sheldon. "Today we assess properly, remove the damaged tiles, treat the wood, and set the new foundation layer. Tomorrow we tile. Sunday we finish and seal."

"Three days."

"If you work well. Longer if you don't." Tanaka moved toward his truck, which had somehow appeared at the base of the property—a route Sheldon hadn't known existed. "Ever done roof work before?"

"Some. On a different kind of building, a long time ago."

"Close enough. The principles are the same." Tanaka began unloading materials, his movements efficient. "Don't fall off. Don't drop anything on my head. Listen more than you talk."

"Those seem like reasonable rules."

"They keep people alive." Tanaka handed Sheldon a coil of rope. "Now let's get to work."

# SCENES 5.4-5.6: Roof Work

**Date:** April 7, 1989 (Friday)  
**Time:** 09:00 - 16:00  
**Location:** Tsukino House - exterior/roof  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 5,800

## Scene 5.4: Roof Work Begins

**Time:** 09:00 - 12:00

The first lesson was the ladder.

"Feet steady. Hands firm. Never more than three rungs at a time." Tanaka demonstrated the climb with the ease of decades, his body moving up the old wooden ladder as naturally as other men walked on flat ground. "The roof is not your enemy. Respect it and it will hold you."

Sheldon followed, his muscles remembering physical work despite years in laboratories. The ladder creaked but held. At the top, the roof spread before him—a landscape of weathered tiles arranged in overlapping rows, some cracked, some displaced, some missing entirely.

"Traditional kawara," Tanaka said, naming the tiles. "Clay, fired at high temperatures. Your grandmother's grandmother probably walked on some of these. Properly maintained, they last centuries."

"And improperly maintained?"

"They become what you see." Tanaka gestured at the damaged section. "Water gets in, wood rots, structure weakens. Another decade of neglect and you'd be rebuilding, not repairing."

They worked systematically. Tanaka removed damaged tiles, examining each one before setting it aside or discarding it. Sheldon learned to read the ceramic—the hairline fractures that meant weakness, the discoloration that indicated water penetration, the particular dullness that suggested the glaze had failed.

"You have good eyes," Tanaka observed after an hour. "Most people can't see the cracks until I point them out."

"I'm trained to look for patterns. Inconsistencies."

"In tiles?"

"In everything." Sheldon handed across another damaged piece. "Science is mostly looking at things until you see what everyone else missed."

Tanaka made his characteristic sound—half grunt, half acknowledgment. "Michiko-san was the same. She could look at a person and see what ailed them before they said a word. The village thought it was magic. She said it was just paying attention."

"Did you know her well?"

"Well enough. Repaired this roof twice before. Built the new section of the shop when she expanded her practice." Tanaka's hands never stopped moving as he talked. "She was a good woman. Stubborn, but good. Didn't suffer fools."

"I'm told I'm similar. The stubborn part, anyway."

"Runs in families." Tanaka paused, looking at Sheldon directly. "You really didn't know her? Never visited?"

The question required careful navigation. "There was... distance. Between my parents and this side of the family. By the time I could have come on my own, it seemed too late."

"Hm." Tanaka accepted this without visible judgment. "Families are complicated. But you're here now. That counts for something."

The morning passed in steady labor. Sheldon's body found a rhythm—the physical movements of lifting, positioning, stabilizing becoming as automatic as any laboratory procedure. The sun climbed higher. Sweat beaded on his forehead, ran down his back. His muscles announced themselves in ways they hadn't for years.

By noon, the damaged section was stripped to bare wood. The underlying structure was exposed—beams and rafters that had been hidden for decades, now visible in the harsh spring light.

"Solid," Tanaka pronounced, running his hands along the timber. "Some weathering, but the core is sound. Your not-grandfather maintained better than I thought."

"Not-grandfather?"

"Masaki isn't really your family, is he? The connection is through the Tsukino side." Tanaka shrugged. "But he's been caring for this house as if it were his own. That makes him something, even if we don't have a word for it."

---

## Scene 5.5: Midday Break

**Time:** 12:00 - 13:00

They ate in the garden, sitting on the engawa of the house Sheldon was slowly claiming.

Tanaka's lunch was practical—rice balls, pickled vegetables, a thermos of tea. Sheldon's bento from Rea was more elaborate, but they shared without comment, the food becoming communal in the way of working men everywhere.

"So," Tanaka said between bites, "you're staying."

"Yes."

"Not just visiting. Not just settling affairs." His eyes were sharp. "Making a life."

"That's the intention."

"Hm." Tanaka chewed slowly. "The village will have opinions."

"They seem to already."

"Those are just curiosity. The real opinions come later, once people see how you handle yourself. Whether you keep up the property. Whether you're reliable." Tanaka set down his chopsticks. "Michiko-san earned her place over sixty years. You're starting fresh."

"I understand."

"Do you?" The older man's voice wasn't unkind, but it was direct. "You come from somewhere else—America, cities, whatever you did before. This place runs on different rules. People watch. They remember. What you do today, they'll talk about in twenty years."

Sheldon considered this. The weight of small community observation, the way every action accumulated into reputation.

"Then I'd better do things worth talking about."

Tanaka's weathered face cracked into something that might have been a smile. "That's the right answer. Doesn't mean it'll be easy."

"I didn't expect easy."

"Good. Because tonight a man is coming who will have more questions than anyone. And he has more right to ask them."

"Nobuyuki."

"The son-in-law. Kiyone's husband." Tanaka picked up his tea. "He comes every weekend to see the boy. Hasn't missed one in three years, not since she died. Whatever else you think of him, remember that."

"I've heard he works too hard. That he uses it to avoid grief."

"Who told you that?"

"Various sources."

"Hm. It's true enough. But there's another way to see it." Tanaka drained his thermos. "He works hard so he can provide for a son he can only see two days a week. He drives three hours each way because he won't let the boy forget him. He calls every night to say goodnight." The older man's voice carried something like respect. "A man who runs from grief doesn't do that. A man who runs toward duty does."

The observation settled over Sheldon like a new understanding. The picture of Nobuyuki was more complex than he'd assumed.

"You know him."

"I know everyone in this valley who owns a building. He's consulted me twice on designs—traditional elements for modern structures. The man knows his craft." Tanaka stood, brushing crumbs from his work clothes. "Whether he'll like you is another matter. But he's not the villain some people paint him to be."

---

## Scene 5.6: Afternoon Work

**Time:** 13:00 - 16:00

The afternoon was treatment and preparation.

Tanaka produced brushes and containers of what he called *kakishibu*—persimmon tannin, a traditional wood preservative that smelled sharp and organic. Sheldon learned to apply it carefully, working with the grain, ensuring coverage without excess.

"This wood has seen centuries," Tanaka said, guiding Sheldon's brush strokes. "The treatment keeps it seeing more. Most modern builders use chemicals—faster, more predictable. But for a house like this, the old ways are better."

"Why?"

"Because the house was built expecting these treatments. The wood knows this substance. They've grown old together." Tanaka's voice carried the particular certainty of a craftsman speaking his truth. "You could use something modern, and it would work. But it would be like speaking a foreign language to an old friend."

The metaphor struck Sheldon as oddly apt. He was, after all, speaking the language of this place as best he could—learning its rhythms, respecting its history, trying to understand what it expected of those who lived here.

By mid-afternoon, the exposed section was treated and sealed. Tanaka tested the work with practiced hands, checking adhesion and coverage.

"Good," he pronounced. "We let this cure overnight. Tomorrow, we lay the foundation layer—waterproofing and underlayment. Sunday, the tiles go back."

"And then it's done?"

"Then the roof is done. The rest of the house..." Tanaka gestured at the building behind them. "That's a longer conversation. But the urgent work is handled. You can live here without water coming through the ceiling."

They cleaned and organized in the day's final hour. Tools went back to the truck in their designated places. Unused materials were covered and secured. The worksite was left as tidy as if professionals had never been there—a point of pride, Tanaka made clear.

"The way you leave a job says as much as the work itself," he said. "Anyone can make a mess. Finishing properly requires discipline."

Sheldon thought of laboratory protocols, of the meticulous cleanup that followed every experiment. Some principles were universal.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asked.

"Earlier. Seven, if you can manage it. The tiling is precise work—better done in morning light." Tanaka extended his hand—a Western gesture that felt natural despite the setting. "You did well today. The hands are good even if they're soft. They'll toughen."

"Thank you. For teaching."

"Thank me when the roof holds through the rainy season." But there was warmth beneath the gruffness. "Tomorrow, Tsukino-san."

The truck descended the back road, its engine fading into the mountain silence. Sheldon stood alone in the garden of a house that was becoming his, his body tired in ways he hadn't experienced for years, his mind quiet in a way he hadn't known he was missing.

The climb back to the shrine awaited. And at its top, whatever the evening would bring.

## Scene 5.7: Return to Shrine

**Time:** 16:00 - 17:00

The climb felt different with a day's labor in his muscles.

Sheldon's legs moved through the familiar rhythm of the steps, but each rise required conscious effort now. His arms ached from lifting and positioning. His shoulders remembered the weight of tiles. His hands—soft from years of academic work—had developed the faint redness that would become calluses if the work continued.

He hadn't felt this physically used since graduate school, when he'd helped a colleague renovate an old building for laboratory space. Even then, the work had been amateur, supervised more by enthusiasm than skill. Today had been different. Today had been *craft*—methodical, purposeful, connected to centuries of tradition.

The shrine's torii gate appeared through the trees, and with it, a small figure waiting on the top step.

"Uncle Sheldon!" Tenchi's voice carried more concern than excitement. "You're all dirty! And you smell like... like trees and old stuff!"

"Persimmon tannin," Sheldon said, reaching the top of the stairs with some relief. "It's a wood treatment."

"It smells weird." But Tenchi's arms were already wrapping around Sheldon's legs, indifferent to the dust and sweat. "Did you fix the scary house?"

"We started. The roof will take three days."

"Three whole days?" Tenchi's face fell. "But Daddy comes tomorrow."

"I'll still be here when he comes. The work can pause." Sheldon extracted himself gently from the child's grip. "But I need to clean up before dinner."

"Rea-nee says I shouldn't hug dirty people, but I don't care." Tenchi grabbed Sheldon's hand instead. "Come on, I'll show you where the outside wash basin is. That's where Grandpa cleans up when he does shrine work."

The wash area was behind the residence—a simple stone basin with a hand pump, obviously ancient but well-maintained. Tenchi supervised the cleaning process with the gravity of a foreman, offering commentary on Sheldon's technique and progress.

"You missed a spot. No, there. Yes, that's better." The child nodded approvingly. "Now you don't smell as much."

"Thank you for your assessment."

"You're welcome. Oh!" Tenchi's eyes widened. "I almost forgot. I made you something at school."

He produced a folded paper from his pocket—creased and somewhat crushed but presented with ceremony. Unfolded, it revealed another drawing: Sheldon on a roof, stick-figure proportions but recognizable, holding what might have been a hammer or might have been a fish.

"That's you fixing the house," Tenchi explained. "See? That's the roof. And that's the scary part that needs fixing. And that's you making it not scary anymore."

"It's perfect."

"I know." Tenchi beamed. "I'm going to show Daddy all the pictures I made. He likes my drawings."

The statement carried weight—a child's determination to share his world with a father who could only visit on weekends. Sheldon folded the picture carefully and tucked it into his shirt pocket.

"I'll keep this safe."

"Good. Because it's important." Tenchi's face was serious. "Daddy needs to know you're fixing things. That means you're staying."

---

## Scene 5.8: Rea Returns

**Time:** 17:00 - 17:30

Rea arrived as the afternoon shadows lengthened, her school bag over her shoulder, her face carrying the particular tiredness of Friday—the accumulated weight of a full week of commuting, studying, managing the household in whatever hours remained.

"Welcome back," Sheldon said.

She paused at the sight of him—still damp from the wash basin, his work clothes dusty despite cleaning, his hands visibly raw where the physical labor had worn away the softness.

"You actually worked." There was something like surprise in her voice. "On the roof."

"With Tanaka. He's a good teacher."

"He's a demanding one." Rea's eyes moved over him with an assessment that felt almost clinical. "Your hands will blister if you don't treat them. There's ointment in the kitchen cabinet—third shelf, small jar with a blue lid."

"Thank you."

"It's practical, not kindness. Blistered hands can't help with dishes." But something in her expression softened the words. "How much did you get done?"

"The damaged section is stripped and treated. Tomorrow we start the foundation layer. Sunday, the tiles."

"Three days." Rea nodded slowly. "Tanaka-san doesn't waste time."

"He also spoke about Nobuyuki." Sheldon watched her reaction carefully. "Defended him, actually. Said he was better than his reputation."

Rea's expression became carefully neutral. "Tanaka-san sees things from a certain perspective."

"And you see them differently?"

"I see..." She paused, choosing words. "I see a man who works very hard at things that keep him far away. I see a boy who waits every week for a father who is always leaving. I see a household that functions best in the five days when he is not coming."

"That sounds like judgment."

"Perhaps." Rea moved toward the residence. "Or perhaps it is simply observation. I have learned to tell the difference, even when others cannot."

She disappeared inside, leaving Sheldon with one more perspective on the man he would meet tomorrow—and the growing sense that no single view captured the whole truth.

---

## Scene 5.9: Evening Kitchen

**Time:** 17:30 - 18:30

The kitchen had become their shared space, Sheldon realized. The place where walls came down.

He stood at the counter, cutting vegetables with hands that complained at every motion, while Rea orchestrated the evening meal with her usual efficiency. The rhythm was established now—he handled preparation, she handled cooking, they moved around each other without collision.

"Tanaka-san said Nobuyuki calls every night," Sheldon mentioned. "To say goodnight to Tenchi."

Rea's stirring didn't pause. "He does. At eight o'clock exactly. Tenchi waits by the phone from seven-thirty."

"That seems... devoted."

"It is devotion. I do not question his love for Tenchi." She set down her spoon, finally turning to face him. "What I question is whether love requires presence or whether it can be administered from a distance. Whether phone calls and weekend visits are enough for a child who still cries for his mother sometimes at night."

"He cries?"

"Less now than before. But yes." Her voice carried no accusation, only fact. "He has nightmares. He wakes confused about where she is. And I go to him, and I comfort him, and I am *there*—not three hours away, not working on buildings that matter more than he does."

"You think Nobuyuki's work matters more to him than Tenchi?"

"I think..." Rea's hands clenched briefly, then relaxed. "I think he has convinced himself that providing for Tenchi financially is the same as being there. I think he cannot face the shrine where his wife died, so he stays away except when obligation forces him back. I think he loves his son desperately and has no idea how to show it except by working himself to exhaustion and calling every night at eight."

The picture was forming—more complex than hero or villain, more human than either extreme.

"And you resent that the burden falls on you," Sheldon said quietly. "Managing what he cannot face."

Rea was silent for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper.

"I resent that I love Tenchi enough to stay. That I cannot leave, even when the weight of it threatens to break me. That Kiyone-sama saved me and then died and left me here to carry what she left behind." Her eyes met his. "I do not resent Nobuyuki. I resent that I am not allowed to resent him, because he is Tenchi's father, and that makes him sacred in ways I can never be."

The confession hung between them, raw and undefended.

"You're allowed," Sheldon said. "To feel whatever you feel. Even if it's complicated. Even if it contradicts itself."

"Is that wisdom or permission?"

"Both. Neither." He set down his knife. "It's just... recognition. That you're carrying more than anyone should, and you're carrying it alone, and no one has said that's unfair because everyone's too busy being grateful that you do it at all."

Rea turned back to her cooking, but something in her posture had changed—a fractional relaxation, the setting down of a weight she hadn't known she was holding.

"Tomorrow will be difficult," she said. "Nobuyuki will ask questions. He will assess. He will decide whether you are threat or asset."

"And what will you tell him?"

"The truth." Her voice was steady now. "That you have been kind to Tenchi. That you work hard. That you are strange in ways I don't understand but not in ways that worry me." A pause. "That Kiyone-sama would have liked you."

It was, Sheldon understood, the highest endorsement she was capable of giving.

---

## Scene 5.10: Dinner - Eve of Arrival

**Time:** 18:30 - 19:30

Dinner was charged with the particular energy of anticipation.

Tenchi couldn't sit still, bouncing between topics with the randomness of excitement. Tomorrow's arrival. His drawings. The roof repair. What Daddy would say about Uncle Sheldon. Whether Daddy would want to see the scary house. Whether Daddy would stay extra long this time because there was so much to see.

"Tenchi," Katsuhito said finally, his voice gentle but firm. "Eat your dinner before it gets cold."

"But I'm not hungry, I'm excited!"

"Excitement doesn't fill your stomach. Eat."

The child subsided briefly, attacking his rice with the same energy he'd been directing at his narrative. Sheldon caught Rea's eye across the table and saw weary amusement there—the expression of someone who had weathered many such evenings.

"Tanaka-san mentioned you'll be continuing the work tomorrow," Katsuhito said, redirecting attention. "Even with Nobuyuki's visit."

"He wants to start at seven. We can work until nine or so, then I'll clean up and be ready." Sheldon had thought this through during the climb. "Unless that causes problems?"

"Nobuyuki's train arrives at nine-thirty. He takes a taxi from the station—thirty minutes with Friday traffic, perhaps less." Katsuhito calculated. "You will have time. And the work will give you something to show him."

"Proof of commitment."

"Exactly." The old man's eyes crinkled. "Words are easy. Sweat and blisters are harder to fake."

The conversation turned to practical matters: the weekend's schedule, sleeping arrangements (Nobuyuki would have his usual room, next to Tenchi's), meals and plans. Katsuhito spoke of these things with the practiced ease of long routine, while Rea contributed details he didn't know.

"He will want to inspect the shrine accounts," she said. "And the household budget. He always does."

"Does he doubt your management?"

"He doubts everything. It is his nature." But there was less heat in her voice now, more resignation. "I have the records prepared. Everything in order."

"As always," Katsuhito said. "You are the most reliable person in this household, Rea. Nobuyuki knows this, even if he doesn't say it."

The compliment landed awkwardly, unused to finding purchase. Rea looked down at her bowl.

"One more sleep," Tenchi announced, having finished his rice with remarkable speed. "And then tomorrow, and then Daddy."

"Yes," Sheldon said. "One more sleep."

## Scene 5.11: Dinner - Final Evening

**Time:** 19:00 - 20:00  
**Location:** Dining area  
**POV:** Sheldon  

---

Dinner felt different tonight.

The food was the same—rice, grilled fish, vegetables in their familiar preparations—and the seating was unchanged. But something in the air had shifted, a subtle electric charge that everyone seemed to feel even if no one named it.

Tomorrow. The word hung unspoken over every exchange.

"The roof looked different when I came up the stairs," Katsuhito observed, his chopsticks moving with their usual precision. "Less... damaged."

"Tanaka-san made good progress today. The worst section is patched. He'll return Monday to continue." Sheldon's hands ached pleasantly from the day's labor, a physical reminder of work accomplished. "Two or three more days should complete it."

"And then the house will be ready?"

"Ready enough to live in. The interior still needs work, but the structure will be sound."

Tenchi had been unusually quiet, his food mostly untouched as he watched the adults talk. Now he burst out: "Will Daddy see the house?"

"If he wants to," Sheldon said. "It's not far."

"He should see it! He should see what Uncle Sheldon fixed!" Tenchi's excitement overflowed the bounds of the conversation. "And then he'll know you're staying and everything will be good."

The simplicity of the child's logic was both touching and terrifying. As if Nobuyuki's approval could be won by roof tiles and clean floors. As if belonging were as simple as visible labor.

"Your father will form his own opinions," Katsuhito said gently. "That is his right, as your father."

"But he'll like Uncle Sheldon. He has to."

"We don't tell people what to feel, Tenchi. We show them who we are and let them decide."

The boy's face fell slightly, the first crack in his certainty. Sheldon felt the weight of it—this child who wanted so badly for the pieces of his world to fit together, who had already lost so much and couldn't bear to lose more.

"I hope your father and I can become friends," Sheldon said carefully. "But even if it takes time, that doesn't change anything between you and me. I'm still your Uncle Sheldon. I'm still going to be here."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Across the table, Rea's eyes met Sheldon's briefly. Something passed between them—acknowledgment, perhaps, or solidarity. She too understood what it meant to wait for someone else's judgment, to hope for acceptance while preparing for rejection.

"The train arrives at eight-thirty," Katsuhito said, steering the conversation toward practical matters. "I will meet Nobuyuki at the station. We should return by nine-thirty, perhaps ten."

"Should I—" Sheldon began.

"Stay here. Let him come to you, rather than you going to him." The old man's voice carried the weight of strategy. "First impressions matter. Let his first impression be of you here, at the shrine, where you belong."

*Where you belong.* The words settled something in Sheldon's chest.

"Can I come to the station?" Tenchi asked.

"Of course. You always do."

"And Rea-nee?"

"I have duties here," Rea said quietly. "I will prepare things for his arrival."

The answer was technically true and emotionally evasive. Sheldon filed it away—another piece of the complex relationship between Rea and Nobuyuki that would need to be understood eventually.

Dinner continued, but the conversation had shifted to lighter topics: Tenchi's school week, a festival coming in May, the progress of spring in the village below. Underneath it all, the anticipation hummed like a bass note, felt more than heard.

Tomorrow would change things. How much, and in what direction, remained to be seen.

## Scene 5.12: Story Time - The Waiting

**Time:** 20:00 - 20:30  
**Location:** Tenchi's room  
**POV:** Sheldon  

---

Tenchi was too keyed up to settle.

He bounced on his futon, rearranged his stuffed animals, got up twice for water he didn't drink. The excitement of tomorrow had overwhelmed his usual bedtime compliance.

"I can't sleep," he announced, as though this were a medical condition requiring immediate attention.

"You haven't tried yet."

"I tried thinking about sleeping. It didn't work."

Sheldon settled into his now-familiar position beside the bed, letting the boy's energy run its course. Forcing calm never worked with children; it had to arrive on its own terms.

"Tell me a story," Tenchi demanded. "A long one. About waiting."

"Waiting for what?"

"For something good. Like tomorrow."

Sheldon considered. His usual sources—American folklore, his grandmother's tales—didn't have obvious candidates for this specific request. But perhaps something could be adapted.

"There was once a farmer," he began, "who planted a seed in the spring. It was a special seed, given to him by a traveling stranger who said it would grow into something wonderful—but only if he was patient."

Tenchi's bouncing slowed slightly. Stories had power over him that logic never would.

"The farmer watered the seed every day. He watched the earth where he'd planted it. But for a long time, nothing happened. Days passed, then weeks. His neighbors laughed at him. 'You're watering dirt,' they said. 'Nothing's growing.'"

"But something was growing," Tenchi said, anticipating the structure.

"Under the earth, where he couldn't see, roots were spreading. The seed was doing invisible work, building the foundation it would need. But the farmer had to trust that. He had to keep watering, keep watching, keep waiting."

"How long?"

"All spring. Into summer. The other farmers harvested their crops and the laughing got louder. But the farmer remembered what the stranger had said: *only if he was patient.*"

Tenchi had stopped bouncing entirely now, his small body finally still beneath the covers.

"Then one morning, just when even the farmer was beginning to lose hope, a sprout appeared. Small at first—just a green thread breaking through the soil. But it grew faster than anything he'd ever seen. By noon it was a sapling. By sunset it was a tree. And by the next morning—"

"What? What was it?"

"It was a tree that grew golden fruit. Each piece of fruit contained a seed of its own, and each of those seeds grew just as fast and just as wonderful. The farmer's patience had been rewarded a hundredfold."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, processing.

"So I have to be patient about tomorrow?"

"You have to trust that good things are worth waiting for. Even when the waiting is hard."

"The waiting is very hard."

"I know." Sheldon pulled the covers up slightly, tucking them around the small form. "But morning always comes. And when it does, your father will be here. And so will I."

"Both of you."

"Both of us."

Tenchi's eyes were finally growing heavy, the story having done its work. "Uncle Sheldon?"

"Yes?"

"I'm glad you planted yourself here."

The metaphor, applied so directly, caught Sheldon off guard. He felt something tighten in his chest that might have been tears in a different person.

"So am I," he said. "Sleep now. Morning will come faster if you're not watching for it."

He stayed until the boy's breathing deepened, until the small hand that had been gripping the stuffed bear relaxed into true sleep. Then he rose quietly and slipped out, leaving the door slightly ajar as Tenchi preferred.

The household was settling. Tomorrow was coming. And for now, there was nothing to do but wait.

## Scene 5.13: Evening Conversation - Preparation

**Time:** 20:30 - 21:15  
**Location:** Engawa  
**POV:** Sheldon  

---

Katsuhito was already on the engawa when Sheldon emerged from Tenchi's room, two cups of tea steaming in the cool evening air. The old man's posture suggested he had been waiting.

"He sleeps?"

"Finally. The waiting was 'very hard,' apparently."

"It is, for children. They have not yet learned that time passes regardless of our attention to it." Katsuhito gestured to the waiting cushion. "Sit. We should talk about tomorrow."

Sheldon settled beside him, accepting the tea. The night was clear, stars visible through gaps in the canopy, the great tree's silhouette darker than the darkness around it.

"You have been remarkably patient these five days," Katsuhito said. "You have asked few questions about matters you surely wonder about. You have accepted what was given and worked within those bounds."

"It seemed like the right approach."

"It was. But tomorrow, that patience will be tested differently." The old man sipped his tea, his eyes on the distant stars. "Nobuyuki is not a patient man. He moves quickly, decides quickly, acts quickly. It is what makes him successful in his work and sometimes... difficult in his personal life."

"I understand."

"Perhaps. But understanding is not the same as experiencing." Katsuhito set down his cup. "He will have questions. Some will be direct—who you are, why you're here, what your intentions are. Others will be indirect, woven into casual conversation. He is skilled at extracting information without appearing to seek it."

"An architect's eye for hidden structure."

"Exactly." Something like approval flickered in Katsuhito's expression. "He will watch how you interact with Tenchi. That, more than anything you say, will determine his assessment. Tenchi is everything to him—the only remaining piece of Kiyone, the only reason he returns each weekend instead of losing himself entirely in work."

"I noticed that pattern. Work as escape."

"Yes. But do not judge him too harshly for it. Grief breaks people in different ways. Some collapse inward; others flee outward. Nobuyuki chose flight, and it has kept him functional if not whole."

Sheldon considered this. The portrait of Nobuyuki had been building over these five days—a man of talent and ambition, broken by loss, trying to be present for his son while barely able to bear the weight of what that presence meant.

"What should I tell him about myself?"

"The truth, as much as you can give." Katsuhito's gaze turned penetrating. "I do not know your full story, Tsukino-san. I have chosen not to ask because I believe you have good reasons for what you conceal. But Nobuyuki will press harder than I have. He will want specifics—your past, your education, your plans."

"I have a fabricated history that's legally documented. It's consistent if not... complete."

"Then stay within those bounds. Do not invent details you cannot support. And if he asks something you cannot answer, simply say you would rather not discuss it. Honesty about your limits is better than dishonesty about your facts."

The advice was practical, grounded, exactly what Sheldon needed. He felt some of his anxiety settle.

"There's one more thing." Katsuhito's voice shifted, becoming more serious. "Nobuyuki may not welcome you. Despite Tenchi's attachment, despite your good intentions, despite everything you have done these past days. He may see you as an intruder, a threat, someone trying to replace what cannot be replaced."

"I'm not trying to replace anyone."

"I know. But he may not see it that way, not immediately. If that happens—if he is cold, or hostile, or dismissive—you must not take it personally. You must be patient."

"You've said that word a lot tonight. Patient."

"Because it is the key to everything." Katsuhito rose, gathering the tea cups. "Nobuyuki is protecting his son. That is admirable, even when the protection is misdirected. Show him that you are not a threat. Show him that Tenchi's attachment to you does not diminish his attachment to his father. Show him that there is room for everyone in this household."

"And if I do all that?"

"Then, eventually, he will see what I see. What Rea sees. What Tenchi has seen from the beginning." The old man paused at the door. "That you belong here, Tsukino-san. That this is where you were meant to be."

He disappeared inside, leaving Sheldon alone with the stars and the watching tree and the weight of tomorrow pressing down like gathering weather.

## Scene 5.14: Night - Ready

**Time:** 21:15 - 21:45  
**Location:** Guest room  
**POV:** Sheldon  

---

The journal waited on the desk, its pages accumulating the record of this new life.

*Day 5*, Sheldon wrote.

*Worked on the roof with Tanaka. Physical labor, honest and straightforward. The kind of work where progress is visible, where you can point to what you've accomplished and say: that was me. I had forgotten how satisfying that is—the simple equation of effort producing results.*

*Tomorrow, Nobuyuki comes. The household has been building toward this all week, whether we spoke of it or not. Tenchi is electric with anticipation. Rea grows quieter as the hours pass. Katsuhito prepares me with strategies and warnings.*

*I don't know what to expect. A man broken by grief, defending what remains of his family. A father who loves his son but doesn't know how to be present for him. An architect who sees hidden structures—including, perhaps, the gaps in my own story.*

*I have decided to be honest within the bounds of what I can reveal. To be patient when patience is required. To remember that his resistance, if it comes, is about protection, not rejection.*

*The roof is nearly fixed. The house is becoming livable. The household has made room for me. These are facts, solid as the tiles Tanaka laid today. Whatever happens tomorrow, these facts remain.*

He set down the pen, listening to the household settle into its nighttime quiet. Somewhere, Tenchi was dreaming of his father's arrival. Somewhere, Rea was managing her complicated feelings about the same. Somewhere, Katsuhito was doing whatever it was that old priests did when no one was watching.

And here, in the guest room that had become more home than any place since his grandmother's kitchen, Sheldon was as ready as he could be for whatever tomorrow brought.

He moved to open the shutter slightly, letting in the cool night air. The stars were still visible, indifferent to human anxiety. The great tree stood where it always stood, its presence a constant against change.

Then, distant but distinct, a train whistle sounded.

It came from somewhere beyond the village, beyond the mountains that cradled this valley—a reminder that the world continued outside these sacred grounds. Tomorrow, that whistle would bring Nobuyuki. The outside world would arrive, carrying its judgments and demands.

But tonight, there was only the quiet and the stars and the tree that watched everything with patience beyond human measure.

Sheldon closed the shutter, returned to his futon, and let sleep come.

The waiting was almost over.
