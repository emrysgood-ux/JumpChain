# PART ONE: ARRIVAL

## Day 1 — April 3, 1989

### I. The Awakening

The sky was blue.

That was the first thing. Blue, interrupted by white—clouds, his mind supplied, before he had decided to think. Cumulus. Fair weather clouds. The kind that meant no rain.

He was cataloging. He noticed himself doing it and could not stop. The blue was deep, almost cobalt where the clouds did not reach. The white was pure, edges well-defined. The light suggested mid-afternoon, sun past zenith, probably forty-five degrees above the horizon based on the brightness in his peripheral vision.

He was lying on his back. That came next. Something prickly-soft beneath him—grass, his hands confirmed without his permission, fingers curling into it. Cool earth under that. The smell of green things and damp soil and something sweet he could not name.

A bird called.

Three notes. Clear as struck crystal. Rising, clipping short, falling away. *Ho-hokekyo.* He did not know the bird. Had never heard that particular call. But something in him—something older than the part that cataloged cloud types—recognized it anyway.

*Spring,* his body said. *You are alive, and it is spring.*

The thought should have been reassuring. Instead it sent ice through his chest, because the last thing he remembered was dying.

The cascade failure. The containment breach. Maria Chen's face through the observation window, her mouth open in a scream he could not hear over the alarms. The light—not light, *energy*—expanding outward from the focal point, and in that final fraction of a second, the absolute certainty that there was no time to run, no time to shield, no time for anything at all.

He had died.

He remembered dying.

And now he was lying in a field, looking at clouds, listening to a bird he did not recognize, and his heart was beating steady and strong in a chest that did not hurt at all.

Sheldon sat up.

The motion came easier than it should have. No catch in his lower back—the familiar twinge that had been his companion for fifteen years, absent. His hands pressed into the grass to push himself upright, and they moved without the morning stiffness in his knuckles that he had learned to expect. He looked at them.

Different. They were different.

The shape was his. The length of the fingers, the particular curve of the thumb, the way the tendons moved under skin—all recognizably *his*. But the skin was smoother. Younger. And the scar on his right thumb—the paring knife, Grandmother's kitchen, eight years old and learning to peel apples—

He traced the place where the scar had been.

Smooth. Unmarked.

But not false. Not fabricated. The hand was *his* hand, whole and healed in a way it had not been since childhood. Whatever had happened to him, whatever force had brought him back from death—it had not given him a fake body. It had *healed* him. Restored him to something he had been, or could have been, before time and accidents had left their marks.

*Start with facts,* Grandmother's voice said in his memory. *Facts first. Feelings later.*

He looked around.

The field stretched maybe sixty meters long, fifty wide. Fallow—grass and wildflowers growing where crops had once been planted, the ghost of paddy ridges still visible under the vegetation. A low stone wall to the south, partially collapsed. A treeline to the north, with a cherry tree standing slightly apart like a sentinel, its branches heavy with pale pink blossoms.

Cherry blossoms. *Sakura.* The word surfaced from somewhere, from the years in Kyoto that suddenly felt very far away.

Cherry blossoms meant spring. Early April, in most of Japan. Peak bloom.

He was in Japan.

The realization settled into him with strange weight. The vegetation was right. The quality of the light. The bird call—Japanese bush warbler, he now recalled, though he had never studied ornithology. And when he looked beyond the cherry tree to the horizon, he saw low mountains with the particular silhouette of the Japanese countryside, the kind of view he had seen a hundred times during his postdoc years.

But his postdoc had been in 2010. And he had died in 2025. In Alaska. In a particle physics laboratory that was probably a smoking crater now.

*Think,* he told himself. *You are a scientist. Observe. Catalog. Hypothesize.*

He looked down at himself.

Gray slacks. Single pleat, no cuffs. Well-fitted. White button-down shirt, slightly rumpled from lying in grass but clean. Black leather belt. The clothes were not his—he had been wearing a lab coat over a Stanford t-shirt when—

He stopped that thought. Filed it away. Kept cataloging.

He patted his pockets. Left trouser: coins, jingling. Right trouser: nothing. Back right: a wallet, he realized, pulling it free. Brown leather. Worn at the edges in a way that suggested years of use, of being sat upon and pulled out and handled daily.

He opened it.

Cash. A significant amount—Japanese yen, he recognized the Fukuzawa Yukichi portrait on the ten-thousand note. Three of those. More in smaller denominations. A coin pouch built into the wallet, heavy with change.

A card in a plastic sleeve. He pulled it out.

An ID. His face—*his* face, unmistakably—in a small photograph. But younger. The face he remembered from his thirties, not the one he had seen in the mirror the morning he died. Text in Japanese, which he read with surprising ease—the characters sharp and clear in his mind, the grammar parsing itself without the hesitation he had grown used to. His Japanese should not be this fluent. It had been fifteen years since Kyoto. But the words resolved themselves anyway.

外国人登録証明書. Alien Registration Certificate.

Name: 月野 シェルドン. *Tsukino Sheldon.*

Nationality: アメリカ合衆国. United States of America.

Date of Birth: 1959年3月15日. March 15, 1959.

Status of Residence: 永住者. Permanent Resident.

Date of Registration: 1987年4月.

He stared at the card for a long time.

The name Tsukino was not the name he had been born with. The birthday was not his—he had been born November 3, 1978. He had never held Japanese permanent residency.

But the card was real. He could feel it—the official weight of government-issued documentation, the particular texture of laminated paper, the stamps and seals that marked it as genuine. This was not a forgery. This was *his* card, the ID of the man named Tsukino Sheldon who had registered in Okayama Prefecture in April of 1987.

*Your life,* something in him said. Not his own voice, not exactly, but something gentle and certain. *This is your life now.*

He did not understand. But Grandmother had taught him that understanding could wait. Action could not.

He kept going through the wallet.

More documents. A folded paper—*koseki*, family registry excerpt, he recognized the format from his Kyoto years. It showed a family: Tsukino Takeo, deceased 1978. Tsukino Sachiko, deceased 1985. And Tsukino Sheldon, born 1959, status: living.

His family. Not a fabrication—a history, a lineage, a place in the world. People who had lived and died and whose name he now carried forward.

A photograph, wallet-sized. An elderly woman in kimono. A middle-aged man in work clothes. A woman in a simple dress. A young man who looked like him.

He held the photo closer.

The resemblance was unmistakable—same bone structure, same set of the eyes. This was him, in this photograph, with these people who must have been his family. The Tsukinos. His grandmother—no, his *other* grandmother. His parents, perhaps. A life he did not remember living but which had nonetheless been lived.

He put the wallet back together. Returned it to his pocket. Stood up.

His body moved like a well-maintained machine. No aches. No stiffness. No familiar complaints. His vision was sharp—sharper than it had been since he was twelve years old and got his first pair of glasses. He could see individual leaves on the cherry tree. Could count the petals falling.

He was not wearing glasses. He should have been wearing glasses.

But he did not need them. Whatever had healed his scars had healed his eyes too.

Sheldon looked around again, this time with purpose. He needed to find people. People could tell him where he was, what year it was, how to reach the address on his ID. People meant water, food, shelter.

*First you survive,* Grandmother's voice said. *Then you figure out the rest.*

He began to walk.

### II. The Road

The field gave way to a narrow dirt path, which gave way to a paved road. The pavement was old—cracked in places, patched in others, the kind of rural road that saw more foot traffic than vehicles. No sidewalk. No painted lines. Just gray asphalt stretching between rice paddies that were still flooded with spring water, waiting for the planting season.

He walked east, toward where he had seen hints of buildings from the field. His legs moved easily, his breath came without effort, his heart maintained a steady pace that spoke of reserves he had not realized he possessed.

This body was fit. Not just fit in the way his old body had been fit, with its weaknesses and limitations and accumulated damage from forty-seven years of living. This was fit in a fundamental way, as if every muscle had been tuned to optimal function, every joint aligned to perfect specification.

A gift. Whatever had happened to him, this body was a gift.

He heard the vehicle before he saw it—a distant engine note, the particular rattle of something small and hard-working. He moved to the side of the road and waited.

The truck that appeared around the bend was tiny by American standards. A kei truck, he recognized—the distinctive shape of Japanese light commercial vehicles, designed for narrow roads and small loads. This one was blue, faded by sun, its bed loaded with what looked like farming equipment covered by a tarp.

It slowed as it approached him.

The driver was an older man, sixties perhaps, with the weathered face of someone who had spent decades working outdoors. He leaned out the window and called something in Japanese—a regional dialect, Sheldon realized, the vowels flattened in ways that were not quite standard.

"You lost?" the man asked, switching to something closer to standard Japanese when Sheldon did not immediately respond.

"I am looking for—" Sheldon checked the address on his ID card. "The Masaki area. Near a shrine."

The man's eyebrows rose. "Masaki Shrine? You are going the wrong way. That is up in the mountains." He jerked his thumb over his shoulder. "I can take you to the bus stop. There is a bus that goes up that way."

"Thank you." Sheldon bowed, the motion coming naturally. "I appreciate your kindness."

"Get in, get in." The man waved at the passenger door. "No point walking when there is a truck."

The cab smelled of fertilizer and tobacco and something green—freshly cut grass, perhaps, or the particular scent of rice paddies in spring. The seat was worn but clean, patched in places with tape.

"I am Yamamoto," the driver said as he put the truck back in gear. "Yamamoto Takeshi. I have a farm down in the valley."

"Tsukino Sheldon." The name felt strange on his tongue, but not wrong. "I am... new to this area."

"Tsukino?" Yamamoto glanced at him with interest. "The Tsukino family had a shop in the village, years ago. General goods. Are you related?"

"I believe so." He could not explain the truth—that he did not know, that he had woken up in a field with documents describing a life he did not remember. "My family is... no longer living."

Yamamoto nodded, his expression shifting to something sympathetic. "Ah. That happens. The young people leave for the cities, the old ones die, and the houses stand empty." He navigated around a pothole. "But you are here now. That is something."

"Yes." Sheldon looked out the window at the passing fields. "I am here now."

The bus stop was a simple affair—a covered bench beside the road, a sign listing times and destinations. Yamamoto pulled over and pointed up the mountain road.

"The bus goes up to the shrine. Leaves every hour. The shrine keeper is Masaki Katsuhito—old man, very wise. If you need anything, he can probably help."

"Thank you, Yamamoto-san."

"Welcome to Okayama." The farmer grinned, showing teeth stained by years of tea. "Good luck with whatever brought you here."

The truck rattled away, leaving Sheldon alone at the bus stop. He sat on the bench and waited.

According to a newspaper tucked beside the bench—abandoned by some previous passenger—it was April 3, 1989.

1989.

Thirty-six years before he had died.

He filed that fact away with all the others. It did not change what he needed to do: find shelter, find food, find his place in this world that had been given to him.

The bus arrived at 3:47 PM. It was small, yellow, clearly old but well-maintained. The driver was a middle-aged woman who took his fare—230 yen—without comment and gestured him toward the back.

An elderly woman already occupied one of the seats, a shopping basket on her lap. She studied him openly as he sat down across the aisle.

"You are going to the shrine?" she asked.

"Yes."

"American?"

"Yes."

She nodded slowly. "The shrine keeper sometimes has visitors. Students of the old ways." Her eyes were sharp, assessing. "You do not look like a student."

"I am not sure what I am," Sheldon said honestly. "Not anymore."

Something in her expression softened. "Ah. One of those." She reached into her basket and pulled out a wrapped rice ball, offering it to him. "Eat. Whatever brought you to this mountain, you will need your strength."

He accepted the rice ball. It was still warm from the shop where she must have bought it, seasoned with salt and wrapped in nori. The taste was simple and perfect.

"Thank you."

"I am Tanaka." She turned back to watch the passing scenery. "Welcome to our mountain."

### III. The 320 Steps

The bus let him off at the base of a stone stairway that climbed up through the forest toward something hidden by the trees. A wooden sign—weathered but legible—marked the entrance: 正木神社. Masaki Shrine.

The stairs were steep. He counted them as he climbed: 320, each one worn smooth in the center by generations of feet. The forest pressed close on either side, ancient cedars and maples and cherry trees still holding their blossoms despite the shade.

His body climbed without complaint. The stairs that should have left him winded by the halfway point felt like nothing at all. His breath stayed even, his legs stayed strong, and he reached the top without a single pause.

*Interesting,* the scientist in him noted. *Cardiovascular capacity significantly enhanced.*

At the top of the stairs, the forest opened onto a broad clearing. A torii gate—vermillion red, freshly painted—marked the transition from mundane to sacred. Beyond it, the shrine complex spread across the mountaintop: main hall with its peaked roof, smaller auxiliary buildings, a gravel path raked into careful patterns.

And there, to one side of the main complex, a tree.

Not a cherry tree. Not a cedar. Something else—something vast and ancient, its trunk wider than any tree Sheldon had ever seen, its branches spreading out to shade half the clearing. A shimenawa rope circled its trunk, marking it as sacred, and paper streamers hung from the branches, swaying in a breeze he could not quite feel.

The tree was beautiful. That was his first thought. His second was stranger: the tree was *warm*. Not physically warm—the air temperature was consistent—but warm in some other way, as if standing near it was like standing near a fire that gave off no heat.

*What are you?* he wondered. But the tree did not answer.

"You climbed quickly."

The voice came from behind him. Sheldon turned.

An old man stood on the engawa of the main building, a broom in his hand. He was small, slender, with white hair pulled back in a traditional style. His face was lined with age, but his eyes were bright and alert, watching Sheldon with an intensity that belied his apparent frailty.

"I counted the steps," Sheldon said. "320."

"Most people lose count around 200." The old man set down his broom and descended the steps from the engawa. His movement was fluid, graceful—the movement of someone who knew exactly how their body worked. "I am Masaki Katsuhito. This is my shrine."

Sheldon bowed. "Tsukino Sheldon. I am... looking for somewhere to stay."

"Tsukino?" Katsuhito's expression flickered—something passing behind his eyes too quickly to identify. "I knew that family, once. They had a shop in the village."

"So I have been told."

"And now you are here." Katsuhito studied him, and Sheldon had the uncomfortable sense of being weighed, measured, evaluated against some standard he could not see. "Why?"

It was a simple question. It deserved a simple answer.

"I do not know," Sheldon said. "I woke up in a field this afternoon with documents in my pocket and no memory of how I got here. The address on my ID is in this area. I came here because I had nowhere else to go."

Silence. The wind moved through the great tree's branches, and the paper streamers rustled.

"That," Katsuhito said slowly, "is a very unusual story."

"I am aware."

"And yet you tell it to me—a stranger—without hesitation."

"Would you prefer I lie?"

Something changed in the old man's face. A slight relaxation around the eyes, a softening of the mouth. "No. I have had enough of liars." He turned and gestured toward the main building. "Come inside. I will make tea, and you will tell me more about this field where you woke up."

### IV. The Household

The interior of the shrine residence was traditional: tatami floors, sliding paper doors, the particular aesthetic of Japanese architecture that valued empty space as much as filled. Katsuhito led him to a room that overlooked the great tree, its branches visible through windows thrown open to the spring air.

"Sit." Katsuhito indicated a cushion. "Tea will take a moment."

Sheldon sat. The cushion was worn but clean, positioned precisely where the view of the tree was best. He watched the old man move through the adjoining kitchen, setting a kettle to boil, measuring tea into a pot with hands that moved with practiced efficiency.

"You said you knew the Tsukino family," Sheldon said.

"Knew. Past tense." Katsuhito did not turn from his task. "Tsukino Takeo died before I came to this shrine. His wife Sachiko I met a few times—she would come to pray on the anniversaries. She died in '85."

"And their son?"

"Their son left for America many years ago. He never came back." Katsuhito poured hot water over the tea leaves. "Or so I understood. But here you are, with his name and his face."

"It is my name. It is my face." This much was true. He did not know how it had become true, but he could feel the reality of it—the documents were not forgeries, the identity was not false. He was Tsukino Sheldon, whatever else he might also be.

"Hmm." Katsuhito brought the tea and knelt across from him. The cups were simple, unglazed, the kind that held heat well for sipping slowly. "Drink."

The tea was green, grassy, slightly astringent. It was exactly what Sheldon needed, though he had not realized it until the first sip.

"Thank you."

"You have good manners." Katsuhito set his own cup down without drinking. "Your Japanese is excellent—Kyoto dialect, unless I am mistaken, with American underneath. You hold your chopsticks correctly." He had not given Sheldon chopsticks. This was a test, Sheldon realized. "These things suggest someone who has spent time in Japan. Significant time."

"I studied in Kyoto. Years ago."

"How many years?"

*Twenty-five years in the future,* Sheldon did not say. "Long enough to learn the basics. Not long enough to understand everything."

"No one understands everything." Katsuhito finally drank from his cup. "But some people understand enough to survive. I think you are one of those people, Tsukino-san."

Before Sheldon could respond, a sound from outside interrupted them—the patter of running feet on gravel, then wood, then tatami. A small figure burst through the sliding door with all the energy of a child who had been containing himself for as long as he could manage.

"Ojii-san! I am home from—" The boy stopped mid-sentence, staring at Sheldon with wide eyes. "Who are you?"

He was four, maybe five—small even for his age, with dark hair that stuck up in several directions and a school bag that looked almost too big for his body. His face was open, curious, without the guardedness that adults learned to wear.

"Tenchi." Katsuhito's voice was gentle. "This is Tsukino-san. He will be our guest."

"Guest?" The boy—Tenchi—advanced cautiously, studying Sheldon the way a scientist might study an interesting specimen. "Are you from America? You look like you are from America."

"I am."

"Cool!" The wariness evaporated instantly, replaced by enthusiasm. "I never met anyone from America before. Do you know cowboys? Do you know Michael Jackson?"

"Tenchi." Katsuhito's voice carried a note of warning. "Our guest has had a long day. Let him drink his tea before you interrogate him."

"Sorry, Ojii-san." But Tenchi did not retreat. Instead he sat down next to Sheldon, close enough that their knees almost touched. "What is your name?"

"Sheldon."

"Shel-don." The boy tested the sounds. "That is a funny name. Is it hard to say?"

"Some people think so."

"I can say it." Tenchi puffed up with pride. "*Sheldon.* See? I am good at English."

Something in Sheldon's chest shifted—a warmth that had nothing to do with the great tree outside. This child, with his boundless energy and his unguarded face, reminded him of someone. Himself, perhaps, at that age. Or the children he had never had, the family he had never built, the life that had ended in a laboratory in Alaska.

But this was his life now. This mountain, this shrine, these people.

"You are very good at English," he told Tenchi. "Better than most."

The boy beamed.

### V. Evening

Dinner was simple: rice, miso soup, grilled fish, pickled vegetables. Katsuhito prepared it with the efficiency of long practice, and Tenchi helped where he could—setting out the dishes, carrying the rice, arranging the chopsticks with careful attention to their proper positions.

Sheldon offered to help, but Katsuhito waved him off. "Guests do not cook on their first night."

"I am a good cook."

"Then you can prove it tomorrow." The old man's eyes glinted with something like humor. "Tonight, you rest."

They ate in the same room where they had drunk tea, the sliding doors now closed against the evening chill. The great tree was invisible in the darkness outside, but Sheldon could feel its presence anyway—that strange warmth, still there, still watching.

Tenchi talked throughout the meal, a stream of consciousness that covered his day at school (boring, except for the part where they had played outside), his favorite television show (something about robots), and his best friend Akio (who could run faster than anyone else in class but could not climb trees at all).

Katsuhito listened with the patient attention of someone who had heard many such monologues. Occasionally he would interject a question or a gentle correction, guiding the flow without stopping it.

"And tomorrow is Saturday," Tenchi concluded, "so there is no school, and Ojii-san said we could go to the waterfall if the weather is good."

"The weather will be good," Katsuhito said.

"How do you know?"

"The mountain told me."

Tenchi accepted this without question. Sheldon filed it away with his other observations.

After dinner, Tenchi was sent to take his bath. The sounds of splashing and occasional singing drifted from somewhere deeper in the building while Katsuhito and Sheldon sat in companionable silence.

"The boy is your grandson?" Sheldon asked.

"In a manner of speaking." Katsuhito poured more tea. "His father—my son-in-law—works in the city. His mother died when he was very young. He lives here with me."

"I am sorry for his loss."

"Loss is part of life." The old man's voice was quiet, but something in it suggested depths that Sheldon could not yet see. "What matters is what we do with what remains."

Silence again. Outside, a night bird called—a different song than the bush warbler, lower and more mournful.

"You may stay," Katsuhito said finally. "For now. There is a guest room that has not been used in some time. In exchange, I would ask that you help with the shrine's maintenance. The work is not difficult, but I am not as young as I once was, and there is always more to do than hands to do it."

"Thank you." Sheldon bowed, sitting. "I am grateful."

"Save your gratitude." The old man rose, collecting the tea cups. "You have not yet seen the gutters."

### VI. The Guest Room

The guest room was small but clean—a tatami space just large enough for a futon and a low table, with a window that looked out toward the forest. Katsuhito had left him a sleeping robe and a towel for the morning, along with instructions on how to find the bath.

Sheldon sat by the window for a long time after the house grew quiet.

The stars were brilliant here, away from city lights. He could see constellations he had not seen since childhood—Orion, the Pleiades, the bright path of the Milky Way cutting across the sky. The same stars he had watched from his grandmother's porch in Georgia, the same stars that had inspired him to study physics, to try to understand the universe's underlying architecture.

The same stars that had watched him die, in a different time.

But that time was gone. That life was over. He had been given something new—a body healed of its accumulated damage, an identity with deep roots in this place, a chance to build something different from what he had built before.

He did not know who had given him this gift, or why. He did not know if he deserved it. But he knew what Grandmother would have said:

*You do not waste what you are given. You use it. You make something good with it.*

The great tree's warmth reached him even here, even through the walls of the building. It was not intrusive—more like the presence of another person in the room, someone who meant no harm and asked nothing in return for their company.

*I do not know what you are,* Sheldon thought at the tree. *But thank you for the welcome.*

He lay down on the futon and closed his eyes.

Sleep came easily, carrying him down into dreams where a voice he almost recognized whispered encouragement in a language he almost understood. Not his grandmother—someone else. Someone who had been watching over him for longer than he knew.

He woke once, briefly, in the depths of the night. Through the window, he could see the great tree's silhouette against the stars, its branches reaching toward the sky like outstretched arms.

He was alive. He was here. He would make something good of this second chance.

He slept again, and did not dream.

## Day 2 — April 4, 1989

### I. Morning Routine

Sheldon woke before dawn.

This had not been his habit in his previous life—he had been a night owl by nature, staying up late in the laboratory and sleeping until the last possible moment. But this body woke with the light, alert and ready, as if it had been designed for early rising.

He folded the futon and stored it in the closet, then found his way to the bath. The water was still warm from the evening before, heated by some system he could not see, and he washed quickly, efficiently, the way Grandmother had taught him.

*Cleanliness is next to godliness,* she used to say. *And godliness is hard enough without being dirty too.*

By the time he emerged, dressed in the clothes he had arrived in (slightly wrinkled but still presentable), he could smell food cooking. He followed the scent to the kitchen.

Katsuhito was already there, standing at the stove. He wore a simple kimono in muted colors, and his movements as he stirred a pot of miso soup were precise and unhurried.

"Good morning," Sheldon said.

"You are awake early." Katsuhito did not turn. "Most guests sleep until I call them."

"I am not most guests."

"No." A brief pause. "You are not."

Tenchi arrived moments later, still in his sleeping clothes, his hair even more chaotic than the day before. He brightened when he saw Sheldon.

"You stayed!"

"I did."

"I thought maybe I dreamed you." The boy climbed onto his usual seat at the table. "But you are real."

"Very real."

They ate breakfast together—rice, soup, pickled vegetables, a small piece of grilled fish. Simple food, simply prepared, but Sheldon found himself eating with more pleasure than he had felt in years. The miso was rich and complex, the rice perfectly cooked, the fish seasoned with nothing but salt and skill.

"You like the food," Katsuhito observed.

"I do."

"Good." The old man rose to clear the dishes. "After we finish, I will show you the grounds. There is much to learn."

### II. The Tour

The shrine complex was larger than Sheldon had realized from his brief impression the day before. The main hall, where prayers were offered and ceremonies performed. The subsidiary buildings—storage, ritual preparation, a small space for shrine maidens who no longer came. The torii gate at the head of the stairs. The smaller torii that marked the boundary between sacred and mundane in a dozen different places.

And the tree.

Katsuhito called it Funaho, which meant "ship of the fern." A strange name for a tree, but Sheldon did not question it. There were many things about this place that did not quite make sense by ordinary standards.

"The tree has been here for as long as the shrine has records," Katsuhito said. They stood before it, looking up at the canopy of branches. "Perhaps longer. It is the heart of this place."

"I can feel it," Sheldon said. And then, because honesty seemed to be the currency of this household: "A warmth. Not physical warmth. Something else."

Katsuhito was silent for a long moment.

"Not many people feel it," he said finally. "Most visitors see only a large tree. Sacred, perhaps, but not..." He searched for a word. "Not alive in the way you mean."

"What does it mean that I can feel it?"

"I do not know." But something in the old man's voice suggested otherwise. "Perhaps it means nothing. Perhaps it means everything. We will see."

The tour continued. The grounds required constant maintenance—paths to rake, buildings to clean, gardens to tend. The forest encroached constantly, and without regular effort the shrine would be swallowed by green within a generation.

"My predecessor had help," Katsuhito said. "Volunteers from the village, students seeking training. But the village has grown smaller, and the young people go to the cities. Now it is mostly me and Tenchi, and Tenchi is too young for most tasks."

"I will help."

"Yes. You will." It was not a question.

### III. The House

After the shrine tour, Katsuhito took him down a path he had not noticed before—a narrow track through the forest, separate from the main stairs. It wound through ancient trees for perhaps ten minutes before emerging at a clearing.

A house stood there. Small, traditional, clearly old but structurally sound. A garden had gone to seed around it, but the building itself showed no signs of damage.

"The Tsukino property," Katsuhito said. "Or what remains of it. The shop in the village was sold years ago, but this—this was kept in the family."

Sheldon approached slowly.

The house was familiar in a way he could not explain—not because he remembered it, but because something in him recognized it as *his*. The dimensions, the style, the particular way the light fell through the trees onto its roof.

"The documents in your wallet," Katsuhito continued, "list this as your address. Tsukino Sachiko—the last of the family—lived here until she became too ill to manage alone. She died at the hospital in Kurashiki."

"And the house?"

"Has been waiting." Katsuhito moved to stand beside him. "For you, perhaps. Or for someone."

The door was unlocked. Inside, the house was dusty but intact—furniture covered with sheets, dishes put away, the personal effects of a life interrupted but not ended. Photographs on the wall showed people Sheldon did not remember but recognized anyway: the same faces from the photo in his wallet, the same family he now belonged to.

"It needs work," Katsuhito said. "The roof especially—there is water damage in the back rooms. But the structure is sound. With effort, it could be a home again."

"I will make it one."

The old man nodded, as if this was the answer he had expected.

## Day 24 — April 24, 1989

### Tenchi's Birthday

The boy turned five.

Sheldon had spent the week preparing—quietly, without drawing attention. A gift, carefully chosen: a set of colored pencils from an art supply store in Kurashiki, the kind that a child could use to draw the things he saw. A cake, simple but decorated with the care of someone who had learned to bake from a grandmother who tolerated no shortcuts.

The morning was bright and clear, spring at its peak. Tenchi woke earlier than usual, vibrating with excitement, and barely managed to eat his breakfast before demanding to know what the day held.

"Patience," Katsuhito said. "Good things come to those who wait."

"But I have been waiting!" Tenchi bounced in his seat. "I waited ALL NIGHT."

Sheldon hid a smile behind his tea cup.

The day unfolded in stages. Morning at the shrine, with Tenchi's father Nobuyuki arriving mid-morning—a quiet man in his thirties, an architect by trade, who looked at his son with a mixture of love and grief that Sheldon recognized. Kiyone, Tenchi's mother, had been gone for three years. The wound had not healed.

Gifts came after lunch. Nobuyuki had brought a toy robot, the kind that transformed from vehicle to humanoid figure, and Tenchi's delight at the mechanism was pure and unguarded. Katsuhito's gift was a wooden practice sword, child-sized, light enough for small hands to hold.

"For when you are ready to learn," the old man said. "Not yet. But soon."

And then Sheldon's gifts—the pencils, which Tenchi studied with the intensity of an artist discovering a new medium, and the cake, which drew a gasp of genuine wonder.

"You made this?" Tenchi asked.

"I did."

"For me?"

"For you."

The boy threw himself at Sheldon's legs, arms wrapping tight, face pressed into his thigh. The hug was fierce and unself-conscious, the kind of embrace that children offered before they learned to hold back.

"Thank you, Sheldon-san." The words were muffled but clear. "This is the best birthday."

Something in Sheldon's chest cracked open—a wall he had not realized he was maintaining, a barrier between himself and this new life. He was not just surviving here. He was *living*. Building connections, making memories, becoming part of something larger than himself.

He rested a hand on Tenchi's head.

"Happy birthday, Tenchi."

## Day 28 — April 28, 1989

### Month's End

The last days of April passed in a rhythm that was becoming familiar.

Morning: wake with the light, wash, breakfast with Katsuhito and Tenchi. The meal was simple, always simple, but the conversation was warm—Tenchi's endless questions, Katsuhito's measured responses, Sheldon's own contributions gradually increasing as he found his voice in this household.

Mid-morning to afternoon: work. The shrine needed constant attention—paths raked, buildings cleaned, offerings maintained. Sheldon found he had a talent for the physical labor, his restored body handling tasks that would have exhausted his previous self. And the Tsukino house needed even more—he spent hours there each day, assessing damage, planning repairs, beginning the slow process of restoration.

Evening: dinner, conversation, the quiet hours before sleep. Sometimes Tenchi would ask Sheldon to tell him about America, and Sheldon would share stories carefully edited for a five-year-old's understanding—stories of his grandmother, of learning to cook, of the Georgia countryside that was nothing like these Japanese mountains but somehow felt connected to them anyway.

And always, underneath everything, the presence of the great tree. Funaho. Its warmth reached him wherever he was on the shrine grounds, a constant companion, a reminder that this place held mysteries he did not yet understand.

On the twenty-eighth day, Sheldon stood at the window of the Tsukino house and looked at what he had accomplished.

The roof assessment was complete. He knew now what needed to be replaced, what could be repaired, what would require professional help. The interior cleaning had begun—one room fully cleared of dust and debris, its tatami aired and returned, its windows washed to let in the spring light.

It was not much. A month of work, and he had barely begun.

But it was a beginning.

*One step at a time,* Grandmother's voice said. *That is how you climb a mountain.*

Tomorrow would be April 29—Showa Day, a holiday. Then April 30, and then May, with its own challenges and opportunities. The emergency roof repair would begin next month. Materials were on order from Kurashiki. The village carpenter, Tanaka, had agreed to consult.

He had a plan. He had resources. He had a community that was slowly, carefully accepting him as one of their own.

And he had time. Whatever force had brought him here, whatever purpose lay behind his second chance, it had given him the most precious gift of all: years stretching ahead, unwritten, waiting to be filled.

The tree's warmth pulsed gently, as if in agreement.

*I understand,* Sheldon thought. *I will not waste this.*

He turned from the window and began preparing dinner. The work continued.
