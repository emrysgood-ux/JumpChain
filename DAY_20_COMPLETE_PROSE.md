# DAY 20 — FATHER'S ARRIVAL
## April 22, 1989 (Saturday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Shrine (breakfast) → Tsukino House (work) → Shrine (dinner, reunion)  
**Weather:** Clear, 23°C high, 14°C low, warm spring day  
**Sunrise:** 5:24 AM | **Sunset:** 6:42 PM

---

## SCENE 1: MORNING WALK
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from Tsukino House to Shrine

The morning carried the particular energy of anticipated reunion.

Sheldon walked the familiar path uphill, toward the shrine where Tenchi would be waking to countdown arithmetic—two days until his birthday, some hours until his father arrived. The boy's excitement had been palpable at dinner last night, sleep coming only through exhaustion of patience.

Twenty days since awakening. Two days until Tenchi turned five. Some hours until Nobuyuki arrived.

The arithmetic of waiting had become the household's shared concern. Katsuhito had noted the train schedule: the express from Tokyo reached Okayama at 4:47 PM, then a local connection to Kurashiki, then the village bus that wound up the mountain roads. If all connections held, Nobuyuki would arrive by early evening.

If. The conditional carried weight the boy couldn't yet appreciate.

---

## SCENE 2: BREAKFAST EXCITEMENT
**Time:** 06:20:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

"Can I wait at the bus stop?"

Tenchi's question greeted Sheldon before he'd fully entered the dining room. The boy bounced on his cushion, breakfast half-eaten, patience visibly straining.

Katsuhito's response was patient despite being the third iteration of this exchange. "The bus arrives after dark. The bus stop is in the village. You would wait alone for several hours."

"I could bring a book."

"You can barely read yet."

"I could bring pictures." Tenchi's negotiation revealed creativity if not practicality. "Or I could practice my numbers. I know them all now—one through twenty."

"You can wait here, where we can see the path from the gate. When your father appears, you can run to meet him."

The compromise failed to satisfy completely, but Tenchi recognized the boundary between negotiable and fixed. He applied himself to breakfast with visible effort, each bite a demonstration of patience he didn't feel.

Sheldon ate his own meal while observing the dynamic. The boy's longing for his father wasn't pathological—it was simply the reasonable desire of a child who saw his remaining parent infrequently. Nobuyuki worked in Tokyo. Tenchi lived on a mountain in Okayama. The distance was both geographic and emotional, bridged by visits that couldn't substitute for daily presence.

---

## SCENE 3: MORNING WORK
**Time:** 08:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

Takeshi worked alone today.

"Yamada-sensei has other obligations," the nephew explained when Sheldon arrived. "A consultation in the village—the Mori family has water damage they want assessed. He'll return Monday."

The absence shifted the work's dynamic. Without Yamada's directing presence, Takeshi and Sheldon operated as partners rather than supervisor and assistant. The trim installation continued at a pace that suited their shared rhythm.

"You're moving back Wednesday."

"That's the plan."

"The seals will be cured by then. The house will be livable." Takeshi measured another piece of trim. "Not finished—finishing is another month of small tasks—but livable."

"There's a distinction?"

"Livable means you can sleep, cook, bathe, exist. Finished means every detail is addressed, every surface treated, every joint perfect." He marked his measurement. "Most people live in houses that are livable but not finished. The finished state is aspirational."

The philosophy of construction condensed into practical wisdom. Sheldon appreciated how Japanese carpentry encoded larger truths in its vocabulary—each term carrying weight beyond its immediate application.

---

## SCENE 4: TRIM COMPLETION
**Time:** 10:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The main room's trim installation reached completion.

Standing back to assess the work, Sheldon could see how the fresh wood would age—gradually darkening, accumulating the patina of use, eventually matching the older construction it adjoined. In ten years, no one would distinguish new from old. In twenty, even careful examination might fail.

"The joint at the northeast corner is tight."

Takeshi examined his own work with professional critique. "Tight but not perfect. A traditional carpenter would reject it. For our purposes, it serves."

"Our purposes being practical rather than aesthetic?"

"Our purposes being time-constrained and budget-aware." No defensiveness in the clarification—simply acknowledgment of reality. "Pure traditional carpentry takes three times as long and costs five times as much. The result is marginally better, visible only to experts. For a house that will be lived in rather than displayed, our approach is appropriate."

The economic calculation beneath craftsmanship. Another lesson Sheldon filed for future reference.

---

## SCENE 5: LUNCH
**Time:** 12:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

They ate on the engawa again—the repaired decking now their default lunch location.

"How long have you worked with your uncle?"

Takeshi considered the question. "Since I was fourteen. My father wanted me to continue school—university, a professional career. My mother understood I had no aptitude for academics." A slight smile. "She was right. Books and I have never agreed."

"But carpentry did."

"Carpentry made sense. The physical world behaves predictably—wood responds to treatment, joints fit or don't fit, structures stand or fall. Examinations expect you to know things that seem arbitrary. Carpentry expects you to do things that matter."

The distinction resonated with something in Sheldon's own history—the difference between academic physics and practical application. Theory described; practice accomplished. Both had value. But the satisfaction of tangible creation exceeded the satisfaction of conceptual understanding.

---

## SCENE 6: WINDOW SEALS
**Time:** 13:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, various rooms

The window seal application required precision timing.

"The compound sets in fifteen minutes," Takeshi explained while preparing the mixture. "Once you begin, you can't stop. Each window must be completed before moving to the next."

Sheldon watched the demonstration: compound mixed to specific consistency, applied in continuous bead, pressed into the gap between frame and sash, smoothed with a tool designed for exactly this purpose. The motion was fluid—start to finish in under two minutes, the seal perfect and uniform.

"Your turn."

The first attempt produced acceptable results. The second was better. By the fourth window, Sheldon had found the rhythm—mix, apply, press, smooth, complete. Not as fast as Takeshi, not as uniform, but functional.

"You learn quickly." The assessment carried no flattery—simple observation. "Most people take longer to find the motion."

"I've always learned physical tasks faster than expected." The statement was true for both lives—the physicist's body that had learned sailing and the new body that learned carpentry. Some consistency persisted across the discontinuity.

---

## SCENE 7: MID-AFTERNOON RETURN
**Time:** 15:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino house and shrine

Sheldon walked back to the shrine earlier than usual.

Takeshi had declared the day's work complete—window seals applied to all accessible windows, the remainder requiring scaffold access that would wait until Monday. The house smelled of fresh sealant and possibility.

The path through the trees held late afternoon light at angles that emphasized the forest's depth. Layers of green, darker toward the earth, lighter where sun penetrated the canopy. The stream at its crossing point ran clear over stones he'd now crossed dozens of times.

His life had developed geography. Routes he knew, landmarks he recognized, distances he could estimate without reference. The mountain had stopped being abstract and become specific—this tree, that stone, the sound of the stream at high water versus low water. Knowledge accumulated through repetition until the unfamiliar became familiar became home.

---

## SCENE 8: WAITING
**Time:** 16:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Tenchi had positioned himself at the window facing the gate.

The vigil had begun when Sheldon arrived and showed no signs of concluding. The boy sat with preternatural stillness—a four-year-old capable of remaining motionless when sufficient motivation existed. His attention fixed on the visible portion of the path, watching for movement that hadn't yet materialized.

"The bus won't arrive for at least three hours," Katsuhito observed.

"I know."

"You could play. Read. Practice your characters."

"I can see from here."

The logic was unassailable within its own frame. Tenchi wanted to see his father arrive at the earliest possible moment. Positioning himself to observe the path accomplished that goal. Activities that required looking away would delay the moment of recognition.

Katsuhito didn't argue. Some vigils earned their keeping.

---

## SCENE 9: PREPARATIONS
**Time:** 17:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Katsuhito prepared dinner with attention to circumstances.

"Nobuyuki prefers lighter meals after travel. The journey from Tokyo is exhausting—he'll arrive hungry but not wanting heavy food." The priest assembled ingredients with the precision of long experience. "Soup, rice, simple vegetables. Save the celebration meal for tomorrow."

Sheldon assisted where direction was given—washing vegetables, arranging serving dishes, tasks that required little skill but supported the larger effort. The kitchen operated on rhythms established over decades, and his role was to contribute without disrupting.

"You've done this many times."

"Many times. Kiyone used to prepare these meals when she was alive. Now the task falls to me." No self-pity in the observation—simply fact. "The children adapt to circumstance. Nobuyuki works where work requires him. Tenchi lives where stability exists. I maintain the connection between them."

The household's structure emerged in fragments. Grandfather as anchor, father as visitor, child as the reason for both. Sheldon had arrived into an existing system and been absorbed into its operations.

---

## SCENE 10: EVENING APPROACHES
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The light had shifted toward gold when Tenchi's stillness broke.

"Someone's coming!"

The boy was at the door before Sheldon could turn to look. Through the window, a figure had indeed appeared on the path below the main gate—distant enough that features were unclear but moving with the purpose of someone approaching rather than passing by.

Katsuhito moved to the doorway with measured pace. "Wait until you can see clearly."

"It's Father! I can tell by how he walks!"

"Perhaps. Or it could be someone else."

"It's not someone else. It's him. I know."

The figure grew closer, resolve clarifying into recognition. The walk was indeed distinctive—long strides that covered ground efficiently, a slight forward lean suggesting haste restrained by decorum. Nobuyuki Masaki, approaching the home where his son had been waiting since morning.

Tenchi ran.

---

## SCENE 11: REUNION
**Time:** 18:42:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main path

The collision happened halfway between the gate and the main building.

Nobuyuki dropped his travel bag and caught his son mid-leap, the impact absorbed by an embrace that lifted Tenchi off the ground entirely. The sound the boy made wasn't a word—it was pure vocalization, joy expressing itself without the mediation of language.

"I'm here," Nobuyuki said. "I made it."

"I waited all day!"

"I know. Grandfather told me when I called from the station." The father adjusted his hold, settling Tenchi against his hip like a package whose weight had become familiar. "You've gotten bigger."

"I'm almost five."

"So I hear." Nobuyuki's face showed the particular expression of parents reuniting with children they don't see daily—relief and guilt and love compressed into features that couldn't express the complexity of what they felt. "Show me what you've been doing."

Sheldon watched from the doorway, conscious of being peripheral to a reunion that required no audience. The moment belonged to father and son, to the reconnection of a family separated by circumstance and employment. His presence would intrude.

He stepped back into the main room to give them space.

---

## SCENE 12: INTRODUCTIONS
**Time:** 19:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entry hall

Nobuyuki entered with Tenchi still attached to his side.

"You must be Tsukino Sheldon." His free hand extended for a handshake—Western greeting for the American-raised cousin, a small courtesy that acknowledged Sheldon's background. "Father has told me about you. I apologize we haven't met until now—my schedule rarely permits mountain visits."

"The apology is unnecessary. Your son has kept me well informed about your work."

"Has he?" Nobuyuki's smile carried wry acknowledgment. "I'm sure his understanding of architecture is... creative."

"Father builds tall buildings," Tenchi offered helpfully. "And houses. And other things with walls."

"A reasonable summary." Nobuyuki set his son down—the boy immediately attached to his leg instead, maintaining physical contact through different means. "The simple meals Father prepares are welcome after Tokyo. The train food this afternoon was—"

"Adequate," Katsuhito completed from the kitchen doorway. "You should have eaten at a proper restaurant before boarding."

"Time didn't permit. The client meeting ran long." The explanation carried the weariness of someone who had given similar explanations many times. "But I'm here now. That's what matters."

---

## SCENE 13: DINNER
**Time:** 19:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

The meal proceeded with Tenchi providing continuous narration.

"—and then the roof had these bugs in it, the ones that eat wood, and Yamada-san said we had to fix everything, and Sheldon-san moved back here because his house was broken, and Grandfather showed me how to write my name in the shrine book, and—"

"Breathe," Nobuyuki said. It was the same instruction Katsuhito had given that morning. "The rice will wait while you breathe."

Tenchi inhaled dramatically, held it for effect, then continued at unchanged pace. "—and I've been practicing the steps like you showed me, I can do fifty now without stopping, and Sheldon-san times me with the watch that doesn't work anymore—"

"The watch works," Sheldon clarified. "It just runs slow."

"—runs slow, so I'm probably faster than we think, and my birthday is Monday, is it really only two more days? That's so close!"

The stream of consciousness eventually exhausted itself against the practical requirements of eating. Nobuyuki listened to each detail with attention that suggested genuine interest rather than parental obligation. Whatever distance separated their daily lives, the connection when present was real.

---

## SCENE 14: ADULT CONVERSATION
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Tenchi had been persuaded toward bed with the promise of full days ahead.

The adults gathered on the engawa—Katsuhito, Nobuyuki, and Sheldon arranged in a configuration that allowed conversation without crowding. Tea appeared without anyone clearly having prepared it, the household's rhythms continuing beneath conscious attention.

"The house repairs have gone well?" Nobuyuki asked.

"Yamada is thorough. The structural work is complete—what remains is finishing. Wednesday I move back."

"That's faster than I expected. Father mentioned termites, structural rot—I'd assumed months of work."

"The core structure was sound. Yamada said the builder knew his craft." Sheldon repeated what he'd learned. "The damage was severe in specific areas but hadn't spread to load-bearing elements. Treatment, replacement, reinforcement—enough to restore integrity without complete reconstruction."

Nobuyuki nodded with professional appreciation. "Architecture teaches respect for existing structures. Renovation requires more skill than new construction—working within constraints rather than creating from nothing."

"You're an architect."

"Commercial projects, primarily. Office buildings, retail spaces, the structures that Tokyo consumes endlessly." A slight grimace. "Less artistry than I'd hoped when I began studying. But steady work in a market that values steadiness."

---

## SCENE 15: FAMILY HISTORY
**Time:** 21:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

The conversation shifted toward shared concerns.

"Tenchi seems healthy," Nobuyuki observed. "Happy."

"He thrives here." Katsuhito's response carried no defensiveness. "The mountain suits him. Children need space to run, tasks to accomplish, routines that provide structure. Tokyo would offer different advantages—but these advantages serve him well."

"I'm not questioning the arrangement."

"I know you're not." The priest's acknowledgment dissolved tension that had barely formed. "You question yourself for accepting it. That's different."

Nobuyuki's silence confirmed the observation. The arrangement—father in Tokyo, son in Okayama, grandfather as primary caretaker—was practical but not comfortable. It solved problems while creating others. Nobuyuki provided financial support; Katsuhito provided daily presence. Both were necessary. Neither was sufficient alone.

"He asks about his mother sometimes," Katsuhito continued. "Less often now than a year ago. The questions are more specific—what she liked to eat, what songs she sang. Memory crystallizing into stories rather than presence."

"Is that good or bad?"

"It's human. Grief becomes memory. Memory becomes history. The living move forward while carrying the dead with them."

---

## SCENE 16: PRIVATE MOMENT
**Time:** 21:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, hallway

Sheldon encountered Nobuyuki returning from checking on his sleeping son.

"He's out," Nobuyuki reported quietly. "Exhausted from the excitement. Tomorrow he'll wake at dawn demanding we begin the celebration immediately."

"He's been counting days since I arrived."

"He counts days between all my visits. The countdown is his way of managing anticipation." Nobuyuki leaned against the wall, suddenly looking more tired than he had at dinner. "Being a weekend parent isn't what I planned. But Kiyone's death—the shrine is the only stable home Tenchi knows. Uprooting him to Tokyo would solve one problem by creating several others."

"You don't need to justify the arrangement to me."

"I'm not. I'm justifying it to myself. Again." The wry self-awareness didn't mask genuine discomfort. "Every parent worries they're doing it wrong. Parents in my situation worry more."

"From what I've seen, Tenchi is loved, secure, and developing well. The specific configuration matters less than those outcomes."

"Spoken like someone without children."

"Spoken like someone observing from outside. Sometimes outside perspectives see what inside perspectives miss."

Nobuyuki considered this. "Perhaps. Thank you—for being here, for helping with the house, for whatever role you're playing in his life. Father says Tenchi has attached to you."

"The attachment is mutual."

---

## SCENE 17: WALK HOME
**Time:** 22:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from Shrine to Tsukino House

The night air carried late April warmth as Sheldon descended the mountain path.

The shrine's lights faded behind him, the family settling into sleep with the particular quiet of a household expanded by a visitor's arrival. Nobuyuki would stay through Tenchi's birthday. Katsuhito would host. Sheldon would participate as the extended family member he was becoming.

The Tsukino house waited at the path's end—his house now, two days into permanent residence. The distinction between guest and owner still felt strange, but the strangeness was fading. Each night spent in his own bedroom reduced the novelty by small increments.

*Families are complicated,* Dorothy Mae's voice observed. *The good ones work through the complications rather than pretending they don't exist.*

The Masaki household worked. Not perfectly—no family operated without friction—but functionally. Katsuhito provided stability. Nobuyuki provided resources and periodic presence. Tenchi absorbed both and grew. Sheldon had been incorporated into the system without disrupting its essential dynamics.

Two days until Tenchi's birthday. The future continued arriving one day at a time.
