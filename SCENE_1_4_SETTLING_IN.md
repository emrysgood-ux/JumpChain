## SCENE 1.4: SETTLING IN

**April 3, 1989 — 17:00 JST**
**Location:** Masaki Shrine — Main house guest room
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The guest room was small, traditional, and immaculately clean.

Masaki-san had led me here after Tenchi reluctantly released my hand to start his homework. The room was maybe six tatami mats, but it felt larger somehow. Sparse furnishings, careful proportions, the stillness of a space designed for rest.

A futon was already laid out, the bedding fresh. A small table sat in one corner with a lamp, a tea set, and a folded yukata.

"The bathroom is down the hall," Masaki-san said. "I'll call you when dinner is ready. Please, rest."

Then he was gone, sliding the door closed behind him with quiet precision.

I stood in the center of the room and waited for the stillness to become uncomfortable.

It didn't.

The silence here was different from the hermetically sealed quiet of laboratories. This was alive. I could hear birds outside, distant water, old wood settling into evening. The silence was full.

I sat on the futon and looked at my hands.

They still looked wrong. Clean in a way that erased decades of accumulated damage. Calluses gone, scars gone, even the roughness from years of handling equipment.

I was in a body that felt like mine but wasn't quite.

After a few minutes, I got up to explore.

---

The engawa wrapped around the building's exterior, offering views of the shrine grounds. The sun was lower now, casting long shadows. The main hall was visible—larger than I'd realized, with proportions suggesting age and significance.

And the tree.

Always the tree.

It dominated the view from anywhere in the compound. In the fading light, it looked almost... luminous. Not glowing exactly, but present in a way that ordinary trees weren't.

I found myself walking toward it.

The gravel crunched under my feet. The air was cooling, carrying the scent of cedar and something else—something clean and old.

The trunk was massive up close. Too massive for its apparent species. My mind tried to calculate its age—six hundred years? Eight hundred? The bark was deeply furrowed, suggesting centuries of weather and waiting.

I reached out and touched it.

The bark was warm. Not sun-warm—the trunk was in shadow—but warm in some other way. Like touching something alive and paying attention.

I pulled my hand back.

The branches moved. There was no wind.

I stood there for a long moment, looking up at a tree that was somehow watching me.

"She likes you."

I turned. Masaki-san stood at the edge of the courtyard.

"She?"

"The tree. She's been here a very long time. She doesn't notice most people."

"Trees don't notice people."

"No?" Something almost like amusement in his voice. "Perhaps not ordinary trees."

He walked closer, and both of us looked up at the branches that were definitely not moving, that had definitely been moving moments before.

"You've been through something," he said.

"Yes."

"You don't know what."

"No."

"But you're here now. And whatever brought you to this place... it brought you to the right place."

"How do you know?"

"Because she likes you. And she has very good judgment."

---

The tour continued.

The main hall, where ceremonies were performed. The office for administrative work. The smaller buildings—storage, ritual preparation, a shed for lawn equipment that seemed comically mundane next to everything else.

The Tsukino house was visible through trees to the north.

"Tomorrow," Masaki-san said. "We'll open it properly."

"You said my family built it."

"Your documents say so. The registration goes back several generations." He paused. "You don't remember them?"

"No." The word felt inadequate.

"Memory is strange. It comes and goes. Sometimes the important things stay hidden until we're ready to see them."

"That sounds like something a priest would say."

"Three times a day, minimum. Come. Dinner will be ready soon."

---

The kitchen was smaller than the guest room but felt larger—the expansion that came from purpose and activity. Katsuhito had already started preparations, and the smell of rice cooking mingled with something that made my stomach remember it had been hours since I'd eaten.

Had I eaten anything? I couldn't remember.

"Knife skills?" Katsuhito asked, handing me a cutting board and vegetables.

"Adequate."

"Good." He set me to work on daikon while he prepared the fish. "Tenchi will be happy to have someone new at dinner. He doesn't get many visitors."

"He seems like a good kid."

"He is. His mother died last year. He's handled it better than most adults would."

I thought about the boy's matter-of-fact statement—*My mom died*—and the weight behind those simple words.

"He told me."

"He doesn't tell everyone." Katsuhito looked up, eyes sharp. "He trusted you quickly. He doesn't usually do that."

The knife moved through the daikon in steady strokes, rhythm covering my uncertainty.

"I don't know why any of this is happening," I said finally.

"Few of us do. But we make dinner anyway. And eventually, the reasons either reveal themselves or they don't."

"That's not very comforting."

"No. But it's honest. And I've found honesty is usually better than comfort."

Through the window, the tree's branches silhouetted against darkening sky.

Still watching.
