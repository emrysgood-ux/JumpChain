## REMAINING WORK

### Category A: Scene Registry Creation (Days 3-21)

These days have hour-by-hour tracking but NO scene registries.

**Required Action:** Convert each 60-minute tracking block into a scene definition with:
- Scene number
- POV assignment
- Location
- Characters present
- Events summary
- Word target

**Estimated Output:**
- 19 days × 15 scenes average = 285 scene definitions
- 19 days × 25,000 words average = 475,000 words
