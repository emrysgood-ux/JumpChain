# YEARS 1-3 (1989-1992): THE SETTLING
## Son of Cosmos: Foundation Building
## December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

The first three years establish everything that follows. Sheldon transforms from mysterious stranger to indispensable family member. These are the years of learning, building, and quiet growth.

**Timeline Context:**
- Year 1 = April 1989 - March 1990
- Year 2 = April 1990 - March 1991
- Year 3 = April 1991 - March 1992
- Tenchi ages 4 → 7 (Kindergarten → Elementary 1st Grade)
- Phase I powers throughout (exceptional human, nothing impossible)

---

# PART 1: YEAR 1 — ARRIVAL AND INTEGRATION

## 1.1 — Already Established (Days 1-28)

The first 28 days are documented in detail elsewhere. By the end of Day 28:
- Sheldon is living in the shrine guest room
- He's established as "household helper" in exchange for room/board
- Tenchi has imprinted on him ("Sheru-ji")
- Yosho is cautiously observing
- Village knows him as "the American at the shrine"
- Basic routines are forming

## 1.2 — May 1989: First Full Month

**Daily Routine Emerges:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:30 AM | Wake; personal training (Phase I: looks like exercise) |
| 6:30 AM | Prepare breakfast |
| 7:00 AM | Breakfast with household |
| 8:00 AM | Shrine maintenance with Yosho |
| 12:00 PM | Lunch preparation |
| 1:00 PM | Afternoon projects (repairs, village errands) |
| 4:00 PM | Tenchi returns from kindergarten; homework/play |
| 6:00 PM | Dinner preparation |
| 7:00 PM | Evening with household |
| 9:00 PM | Tenchi's bedtime routine |
| 10:00 PM | Sheldon's personal time; sleep |

**Key Developments:**

- First major repair project (loose boards on shrine porch)
- First village errand alone (grocery shopping)
- First time Tenchi has nightmare; Sheldon comforts him
- Yosho begins assigning more significant tasks
- Nobuyuki's first weekend visit since Sheldon's arrival

**Nobuyuki's First Real Interaction:**

Nobuyuki arrives Friday evening, exhausted from the week. He finds:
- The house cleaner than it's been in months
- Dinner ready
- Tenchi happy and talkative
- His father less burdened

His reaction: cautious gratitude. Who is this man? Why is he here? But Tenchi clearly loves him, and Father trusts him...

> **Nobuyuki to Yosho (private):** "Who is he?"
> **Yosho:** "A man who needed a place. We needed help. It works."
> **Nobuyuki:** "Is he safe? With Tenchi?"
> **Yosho:** "I would not have allowed him to stay otherwise."

Nobuyuki accepts this. He's too tired to push, and the results speak for themselves.

## 1.3 — June-August 1989: Summer Establishment

**The Tsukino House:**

In early June, Sheldon finally visits the house he supposedly inherited. It's been waiting — a small traditional home in the village proper, dusty but structurally sound.

**Key Details:**
- Located 15-minute walk from shrine
- Two bedrooms, one bath, small kitchen, main room
- Garden overgrown but salvageable
- Contains "family" photographs (Cosmos-created history)
- Some furniture, mostly needing repair

**Sheldon's Decision:**

He doesn't move in immediately. The shrine has become home. But the house serves purposes:
- Storage for larger projects
- Space for future workshop
- Evidence of his "legitimate" presence
- Option for the future

He begins cleaning and repairing it on afternoons when Tenchi is occupied.

**Summer Festival (July - Tanabata):**

Sheldon's first major village event. He helps with preparations, observes ceremonies, participates appropriately. Village assessment shifts from "the American stranger" to "the American who helps."

**Obon (August):**

First time honoring "ancestors" he never knew. The Tsukino family graves exist (Cosmos-created). Sheldon visits them, feeling the strangeness of mourning people who never existed.

But he also honors Dorothy — his grandmother from his previous life. No grave here, but he lights incense privately. She's the only real ancestor he has.

## 1.4 — September-November 1989: Deepening Roots

**School Resumes:**

Tenchi returns to kindergarten (final year - nenchō class). Sheldon walks him down the 320 steps each morning, picks him up each afternoon. The routine cements their bond.

**Parent-Teacher Dynamics:**

The kindergarten knows Sheldon as "family friend who helps at the shrine." He attends the autumn parent observation day in place of Nobuyuki (who couldn't get time off). This is significant — he's now representing the family publicly.

**Village Integration Milestones:**

| Month | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|
| September | First invitation to neighbor's home |
| October | Asked to help with harvest festival |
| November | Shopkeeper Tanaka starts giving him the "regular" discount |

**The Repair Reputation:**

By autumn, word has spread: the American can fix things. Small requests begin:
- "Could you look at this door?"
- "The shrine committee needs help with festival storage"
- "My radio stopped working..."

Sheldon helps when he can. He doesn't charge — this is community building, not business. Yet.

## 1.5 — December 1989: First Winter and First Dream

**New Year Preparations:**

December is busy:
- Shrine cleaning (Ōsōji)
- Mochi-making with neighbors
- Decorations
- Preparing for Hatsumōde (first shrine visit)

Sheldon participates in everything. By year's end, he's not "the American" — he's "Sheldon-san" or "the young man at the shrine."

**FIRST DREAM-CONTACT WITH COSMOS**

Late December. Sheldon has been in this world for eight months. He's settled, comfortable, almost forgetting that he died in another life.

Then, one night, he dreams.

---

**The Dream:**

Silver light. A presence. Warmth like sunlight but softer.

*My son.*

Sheldon stands in nowhere and everywhere. "Who—"

*You know who I am. Part of you has always known.*

And he does. Not the name, not the specifics, but the feeling — the presence that was there when he woke in the field, that guided him to the shrine, that suffuses his cooking with warmth.

"You're the one who... brought me here."

*Yes.*

"Why?"

*Because you were worthy of saving. Because this place needed you. Because I wanted you to live.*

"Who are you?"

*Your mother, in a sense. Your creator. Your guardian.*

"That doesn't tell me anything."

*It tells you everything that matters. Sleep now. We will speak again.*

---

**Aftermath:**

Sheldon wakes with tears on his face and no clear memory of the dream — just the feeling of being held, being loved, being *meant*.

The memory fades but the impact remains. He knows, on some level, that he's being watched over. That this isn't random.

He doesn't tell Yosho. Not yet. He doesn't have words for it.

## 1.6 — Year 1 Summary

**By March 1990:**

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Living situation** | Shrine guest room (permanent) |
| **Role** | Household manager, Tenchi's caretaker |
| **Village status** | Accepted; known helpful |
| **Relationship with Yosho** | Trust building; still observed |
| **Relationship with Tenchi** | Strong attachment; father figure |
| **Relationship with Nobuyuki** | Cordial; grateful but distant |
| **Tsukino house** | Cleaned; used for storage/projects |
| **Powers** | Phase I; appearing as exceptional skill |
| **Cosmos contact** | One dream; felt, not understood |

---

# PART 2: YEAR 2 — ROUTINE AND GROWTH

## 2.1 — Spring 1990: Tenchi's Transition

**Kindergarten Graduation (March):**

Tenchi graduates from kindergarten. Sheldon attends the ceremony alongside Nobuyuki. Both men watch the five-year-old receive his certificate.

For Nobuyuki: pride mixed with grief (Kiyone should be here).
For Sheldon: pride and something deeper — he's been part of this.

**Elementary School Begins (April):**

Tenchi starts first grade. New school, longer hours, real homework. Sheldon adjusts:
- Earlier morning routine
- Homework help in the evenings
- New school supplies, uniform preparation
- Parent-teacher communication

Sheldon becomes "the family representative" for school matters. Nobuyuki simply doesn't have time.

## 2.2 — The Repair Business Formalizes

**Village Need:**

By Year 2, requests for Sheldon's help have become constant. The village needs someone who can fix things — the nearest proper repair shop is in town, expensive and inconvenient.

**The Arrangement:**

Sheldon doesn't open a formal business. Instead:
- Word of mouth continues
- He starts accepting small payments (or trade goods)
- The Tsukino house becomes his workshop
- Afternoons shift to repair work
- Income begins flowing

**What He Fixes:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Electronics | Radios, early appliances, wiring |
| Furniture | Chairs, tables, cabinets |
| Household | Doors, windows, plumbing basics |
| Mechanical | Bicycles, small engines, tools |

**Village Impact:**

The repair work cements his place. He's not just "the American at the shrine" — he's useful. He provides a service. He belongs.

## 2.3 — Household Rhythms

**The Three Men:**

By Year 2, the Masaki household has found its rhythm:

| Person | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Yosho** | Patriarch, shrine duties, spiritual guidance |
| **Sheldon** | Household management, childcare, practical matters |
| **Tenchi** | Child; center of their shared attention |

Nobuyuki remains the weekend visitor — loved, welcomed, but not daily presence.

**Domestic Details:**

- Sheldon cooks all meals (his domain)
- Yosho maintains shrine rituals
- They share grounds maintenance
- Tenchi has chores appropriate to his age
- Evening tea on the porch becomes ritual

## 2.4 — Relationship with Yosho: Assessment Continues

**What Yosho Observes (Year 2):**

- Sheldon's consistent kindness (not performed, genuine)
- His patience with Tenchi (exceptional)
- His cooking (something unusual about it)
- His physical capability (slightly beyond normal)
- His lack of sickness (notable)
- His night navigation (suspicion forming)

**Yosho's Conclusion (Partial):**

This man is more than he appears. But his actions are good. His intentions seem pure. Whatever he is, he's beneficial.

Yosho decides to wait. Watch. Learn.

**Their Dynamic:**

Still formal. Still employer-employee adjacent. But warming. Evening conversations grow longer. Yosho shares edited stories of "the shrine's history." Sheldon listens, asks questions, respects boundaries.

## 2.5 — Year 2 Milestones

| Season | Key Events |
|--------|------------|
| **Spring** | Tenchi starts elementary; Sheldon becomes school liaison |
| **Summer** | Repair work formalizes; workshop established |
| **Autumn** | First anniversary at shrine; village fully accepts Sheldon |
| **Winter** | Second dream-contact with Cosmos (brief, reassuring) |

---

# PART 3: YEAR 3 — SOLIDIFICATION

## 3.1 — The Household Is Complete

By Year 3, no one questions Sheldon's place. He's been there longer than most can remember not being there. The shrine feels complete with him.

**Village Perception:**

| Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| "The American stranger" | "Sheldon-san who fixes things" | "Part of the shrine family" |

## 3.2 — Tenchi (Age 6-7)

**School Progress:**

Tenchi is a good student. Not exceptional, but solid. He has friends, does his homework, participates in activities. Sheldon helps with everything:
- Reading practice
- Math homework
- Art projects
- Sports day preparation

**Father-Son Bond:**

By Year 3, Tenchi's attachment to Sheldon is undeniable. The boy:
- Seeks Sheldon for comfort after bad dreams
- Asks Sheldon before asking Grandpa
- Imitates Sheldon's habits
- Calls him "Sheru-ji" exclusively (not "Sheldon-san")

Nobuyuki notices. It stings, but he also recognizes: Sheldon is there. He isn't. He can't be.

> **Nobuyuki to Sheldon (awkward, grateful):** "Thank you. For being here when I can't."
> **Sheldon:** "He's a good kid. It's not hard."

## 3.3 — Approaching the Breaking Point

**Sheldon's Discomfort:**

By late Year 3, Sheldon's Phase I abilities are straining against normalcy:

| Ability | Suppression Cost |
|---------|------------------|
| Night vision | Must pretend; carry flashlights |
| Enhanced hearing | Must not react to distant sounds |
| Never sick | Must occasionally fake minor illness |
| Fast healing | Must hide quick recovery |
| Cooking "warmth" | Can't explain why food helps so much |

The constant performance is exhausting. Yosho clearly suspects something. How long can this continue?

**The Building Pressure:**

Sheldon lies to Yosho daily through omission. He lies to Tenchi through suppression. The cognitive load is significant. He came here for a fresh start, and he's built a life on hidden truths.

Something has to give.

(This leads directly to Year 4's revelation to Yosho.)

## 3.4 — Year 3 Milestones

| Season | Key Events |
|--------|------------|
| **Spring** | Tenchi enters 2nd grade; thriving |
| **Summer** | Shrine repairs completed; Sheldon's largest project |
| **Autumn** | Village festival; Sheldon on organizing committee |
| **Winter** | Third dream-contact; Cosmos says "Soon you will need to trust." |

## 3.5 — Year 3 Summary

**By March 1992:**

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Living situation** | Shrine (permanent); workshop at Tsukino house |
| **Role** | Indispensable household member |
| **Village status** | Fully integrated; on committees |
| **Relationship with Yosho** | Deep trust; mutual respect |
| **Relationship with Tenchi** | Father-son in all but blood |
| **Relationship with Nobuyuki** | Respected; some guilt/gratitude |
| **Powers** | Phase I; suppression becoming difficult |
| **Cosmos contact** | Periodic dreams; feeling of guidance |
| **Internal state** | Stable but straining from deception |

# PART 4: COSMOS DREAM-CONTACTS

## 4.1 — Dream #1 (December 1989)

**Setting:** Silver light; warmth; presence
**Tone:** Introduction; reassurance
**Message:** "You are meant to be here. You are loved."
**Sheldon's Memory:** Fragmentary; feeling more than words
**Impact:** Sense of purpose; not alone

## 4.2 — Dream #2 (December 1990)

**Setting:** Same silver space; more defined
**Tone:** Checking in; guidance
**Message:** "You are doing well. Trust the path."
**Details:**
- Sheldon asks about his abilities
- Cosmos doesn't explain (too soon)
- She affirms his choices
- Brief glimpse of her form (silver hair, kind eyes)

**Sheldon's Memory:** Clearer than first; still fades by morning
**Impact:** Confidence in his approach

## 4.3 — Dream #3 (December 1991)

**Setting:** The silver space feels like home now
**Tone:** Warning; preparation
**Message:** "Soon you will need to trust."
**Details:**
- Cosmos acknowledges his struggle with hiding
- She doesn't give explicit instruction
- "The old one watches you. He is worthy of truth."
- "The child is strong. He can bear what you can share."

**Sheldon's Memory:** This one sticks. He wakes knowing something is coming.
**Impact:** Seeds planted for Year 4 revelation

## 4.4 — Dream Pattern

- Annual (roughly December)
- Increasing clarity each time
- Cosmos doesn't control, only guides
- She respects Sheldon's autonomy
- Information is minimal but meaningful

---

# PART 5: UNCLE KIYOSHI CONTACT

## 5.1 — The Letter (Year 1)

Per his cover story, Sheldon arrived with an introduction letter from Uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka. He needs to acknowledge this relationship.

**Month 2 (May 1989):**

Sheldon writes to Kiyoshi Tsukino:
- Thanks him for the house
- Reports he's settled at the shrine
- Offers to visit when convenient
- Polite, respectful, brief

**Kiyoshi's Response (June 1989):**

A warm letter welcoming "Yuki's son" to Japan:
- Expresses happiness Sheldon found the house useful
- Invites him to visit Osaka when he can
- Mentions family (wife Haruko, children, grandchildren)
- Notes resemblance to "your mother" (Cosmos-created memory)

## 5.2 — The First Visit (Year 2)

**Late Summer 1990:**

Sheldon takes a few days to visit Osaka. His first meeting with "family."

**What He Finds:**

The Kiyoshi household is warm, chaotic, loving:
- Uncle Kiyoshi (67): Retired factory foreman, quiet authority
- Aunt Haruko (64): The talker and feeder
- Cousins, their spouses, grandchildren — a full house

**What Happens:**

- Sheldon is fed excessively
- He's shown family photos (including "his mother Yuki")
- He's asked about his life, his plans, his health
- He's welcomed as family without reservation

**Sheldon's Internal Experience:**

Strange and painful. These people believe a fiction. They mourn a sister/aunt who never existed. Their love is real, even if based on created history.

But also... healing. He has no family from his previous life here. These people offer belonging, even if the foundation is artificial.

He accepts the gift. He doesn't abuse it.

## 5.3 — Ongoing Relationship

**Pattern Established:**
- Annual visits (summer or New Year)
- Letters exchanged periodically
- Sheldon sends gifts for occasions
- He's "the American cousin who lives at a shrine"

The relationship is real, even if the backstory isn't. Sheldon doesn't lie to them more than the cover story requires.

# PART 8: RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT

## 8.1 — Sheldon-Yosho (Years 1-3)

**Phase 1: Assessment**

| Year | Yosho's Stance | Key Moments |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Wary observation | Watching how Sheldon treats Tenchi |
| 2 | Cautious trust | Assigns more responsibility |
| 3 | Respect with suspicion | Knows something is hidden |

**What Draws Them Together:**
- Shared responsibility for Tenchi
- Mutual appreciation of silence
- Both carrying secrets
- Complementary skills (spiritual/practical)
- Evening conversations

**What Keeps Distance:**
- Yosho's 700-year caution
- Sheldon's hidden nature
- Both withholding truth
- The employer-employee origin

**By End of Year 3:**
Trust is deep but incomplete. Both know the other is hiding something. Neither pushes. The revelation (Year 4) is coming because the strain is unsustainable.

## 8.2 — Sheldon-Tenchi (Years 1-3)

**Evolution:**

| Year | Relationship Stage | Key Markers |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Attachment forming | Tenchi seeks Sheldon's company |
| 2 | Dependence | Sheldon is primary caretaker |
| 3 | Father-son | "Sheru-ji" is his parent in practice |

**What Sheldon Provides:**
- Consistency (Nobuyuki is absent)
- Warmth (Yosho is reserved)
- Patience (endless, for this child)
- Security (always there)
- Love (genuine, growing)

**What Tenchi Gives Sheldon:**
- Purpose
- Joy
- A reason to be here
- Someone to protect
- Unconditional trust

## 8.3 — Sheldon-Nobuyuki (Years 1-3)

**Dynamics:**

- Nobuyuki is grateful but guilty
- He should be raising his son
- Instead, a stranger does it better
- He respects Sheldon; it also hurts

**Key Conversations:**

Year 1: "Thank you for helping."
Year 2: "I don't know what we'd do without you."
Year 3: "Tenchi loves you. I'm glad... and I'm sorry I'm not here more."

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Never competes with Nobuyuki
- Always frames Nobuyuki as "your dad"
- Supports the father-son relationship
- Doesn't replace; augments

---

# PART 9: HISTORICAL CONTEXT

## 9.1 — Japan 1989-1992

| Year | Events | Impact on Story |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **1989** | Shōwa Emperor dies; Heisei begins | National transition; village ceremonies |
| **1989** | Consumption tax introduced | Minor economic impact |
| **1990** | Economic bubble peak | Village relatively unaffected |
| **1991** | Bubble begins bursting | Some village concern |
| **1991** | Gulf War | News in background |
| **1992** | Recession deepening | Village feels it slightly |

## 9.2 — Rural Okayama Specifics

The village exists somewhat outside national trends:
- Agricultural rhythms matter more than stock markets
- Traditional festivals continue unchanged
- Young people leave; older generation remains
- Shrine is community anchor
- Sheldon's presence is notable because nothing much changes here
