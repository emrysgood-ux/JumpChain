### BUILD PHILOSOPHY

Cosmos selected grants following five principles:

1. **Parental Protection** - Creations never harm; healing through food; perfect teaching ability
2. **Concealment** - Effects hidden from Chousin; powers appear as natural talent
3. **Integration** - Legitimate background; social acceptance; village belonging
4. **Creation** - Building, repairing, improving safely; craftsmanship excellence
5. **Long-term Sustainability** - 1000-year timeline; gradual, natural-seeming development

All grants active but experienced as:
- "I've always been good at this"
- "Lucky break"

- "Good intuition"

Sheldon does NOT recognize these as supernatural. He attributes them to his PhD training, Georgia upbringing, and quick adaptation.

### Day 366: Partial Awakening

JumpChain perks unlock with full awareness. Celestial Pack grants remain active but still not consciously recognized as distinct abilities.

### Years 2-10: Gradual Recognition

Sheldon begins to understand that some abilities exceed normal explanation. Correlation with Cosmos connection becomes apparent.

### Year 20+: Full Integration

Clear understanding of the dual power system. Conscious use of all abilities. Lambda energy acknowledged.
