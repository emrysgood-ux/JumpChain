# RESEARCH AREA 1: RYOKO'S ASTRAL OBSERVATION

## Canon Facts (Verified)

**Astral Body Limitations:**
- Ryoko could create an astral body (ghostly consciousness projection)
- Limited to **the entrance of the cave** — not unlimited range
- Could observe the shrine grounds, but not travel freely

**What She Observed (Canon):**
- Watched Tenchi grow from baby to teenager
- Reached out to touch baby Tenchi (he wasn't afraid, just curious)
- Attempted to comfort him when his grandmother died
- Saved a cat (Chibi) Tenchi found by using her energy to keep it alive
- "Felt the cold and damp" for 700 years — she was conscious the entire time

**Yosho's Plan (Canon):**
- Yosho KNEW Ryoko was watching Tenchi
- Deliberately arranged for Tenchi to be near the cave
- Kiyone (Tenchi's mother) was part of this plan — took young Tenchi by the cave
- Goal: Let Ryoko "experience childhood through Tenchi" to rehabilitate her

**Her Attack on Tenchi (Canon):**
- Not serious — "could have eliminated Tenchi along with the entire school if she wanted"
- Letting off steam after 700 years of cold, damp confinement
- FAQ describes it as "mere child's play for her"

## Implications for Our Story

**Ryoko's Observation of Sheldon:**

| Factor | Canon Limit | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Range | Cave entrance only | Can only observe shrine grounds |
| Duration | 12 years (1989-2001) | Significant but partial observation |
| Content | Visual + limited sensing | Sees Sheldon at shrine, cooking smells, etc. |
| Detail | Surface level | Doesn't know private conversations |

**What Ryoko COULD Observe:**
- Sheldon arriving at the shrine (Day 1)
- Sheldon's regular presence at shrine grounds
- Tenchi's interactions with Sheldon in observable areas
- General family dynamics when outdoors
- Possibly: Senses Sheldon's "different" energy

**What Ryoko COULD NOT Observe:**
- Private conversations inside buildings
- Sheldon's relationship with Yosho in detail
- Sheldon's cooking (kitchen is inside)
- The move to Tsukino house (different location)

**DECISION POINT:** Does Ryoko's limited observation change her release behavior significantly?

**Recommendation:** Minimal change to initial release. Ryoko still attacks (letting off steam), but may recognize Sheldon faster when she sees him. Her 700-year imprisonment trauma remains primary driver.

# RESEARCH AREA 2: WASHU'S DETECTION ABILITIES

## Canon Facts (Verified)

**Washu's Nature:**
- One of three Chousin (creator goddesses)
- Sealed her powers and memories in the three gems to become mortal
- Currently operating with MORTAL limitations
- Age: 20,000+ years (as human)

**Washu's Detection Methods:**
- Uses TECHNOLOGY, not innate divine perception
- Created laboratory with advanced scanning equipment
- Detected Zero's infiltration via **physical mark** (Clay's logo on buttocks during bath)
- NOT by sensing Zero's nature or power

**Washu's Interest Triggers:**
- Immediately interested in Tenchi after Kagato defeat
- Reason: He manifested Light Hawk Wings without a Royal Tree
- Wants to study anomalous power signatures
- Makes Tenchi her "love and research project"

**Chousin Perception Limits:**
- "Just as Dr. Clay's robot Zero couldn't prove the existence of Tokimi when she saw her, the Choushin couldn't prove the existence of a being higher than they"
- Cannot perceive beings above their dimensional tier
- Created THIS multiverse, but cannot see outside it

---

## Implications for Our Story

**Washu's Detection of Sheldon:**

| Method | Capability | Result |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Visual | Normal | Sees a human male |
| Technology scan | Advanced | Detects anomalous signature |
| Chousin perception | LIMITED | Cannot fully parse Cosmos's work |

**Timeline of Detection:**

1. **Day 1 of Washu's arrival** — Notices Sheldon
2. **First scan** — Detects "something unusual" but can't classify
3. **Deeper analysis** — Power signature doesn't match ANY known classification
4. **Hypothesis testing** — Rules out Juraian hybrid, dimensional traveler origin
5. **Conclusion** — "Another god's fingerprints" — but WHICH god?

**Critical Insight:** Washu, even as a Chousin, may not be able to fully comprehend Cosmos's work because:
- Cosmos exists in a different cosmic hierarchy (Sailor Moon multiverse)
- Lambda Power is from OUTSIDE the Tenchi Muyo cosmology
- The Chousin created their multiverse but don't have visibility into others

**DECISION POINT:** Does Washu eventually identify Cosmos specifically?

**Recommendation:** No. Washu concludes "another god's work — one I don't recognize" but cannot identify Cosmos. This maintains mystery and respects both cosmic hierarchies.

# RESEARCH AREA 3: ZERO INFILTRATION

## Canon Facts (Verified)

**Zero's Capabilities:**
- Perfect physical duplication
- Copies memories completely
- Copies emotions (this became her weakness)
- Given power by Tokimi
- COULD NOT duplicate Ryoko's gems (used originals)

**Detection Method:**
- Washu detected Zero via **Dr. Clay's logo on her buttocks**
- Discovered during a bath scene
- Washu then used gem connection to monitor Zero's plans
- NO one detected Zero through power sensing or behavioral analysis

**Zero's Failure:**
- Copied Ryoko's love for Tenchi
- Could not bring herself to kill Tenchi
- Emotions overrode programming
- Eventually defied Clay, freed Washu, merged with Ryoko

**Tokimi's Involvement:**
- Zero "cannot quantify" Tokimi's existence
- Tokimi and D3 watched events unfold
- Interested in Tenchi specifically
- Clay and Zero's memories of Tokimi were blocked by D3

## Implications for Our Story

**How Stable Household Affects Zero:**

| Factor | Canon Household | Our Household | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Ryoko's emotions | Chaotic, competitive | More integrated | Zero copies calmer Ryoko |
| Bath frequency | Regular | Regular | Same detection method possible |
| Behavioral baseline | Erratic | More stable | Deviations more noticeable |
| Sheldon's observation | N/A | Present | Additional set of eyes |

**Potential Changes:**

1. **Ryoko's copied emotions** — If Ryoko is less combative (from "aunt" dynamic), Zero is less aggressive
2. **Sheldon notices** — As someone who cooks for the family, Sheldon might notice subtle behavioral differences (eating habits, food preferences)
3. **Washu still detects** — Bath scene still happens; logo still visible
4. **Resolution similar** — Zero's emotional awakening still occurs

**DECISION POINT:** Does Sheldon detect Zero before Washu?

**Recommendation:** Possibly suspects something is "off" but doesn't have proof. Washu still makes the actual detection. This respects canon while using Sheldon's observational skills.

# RESEARCH AREA 4: JURAI MARRIAGE LAW

## Canon Facts (Verified)

**Marriage Customs:**
- "Marriages amongst relatives in the family was not uncommon"
- Royal inbreeding is accepted/expected
- Ayeka was formally betrothed to half-brother Yosho
- Political marriages are standard

**Mixed Blood Prejudice:**
- "Not all Juraians liked the idea of mixed blood heritages"
- Yosho faced prejudice as half-Earthling (mother Funaho from Earth)
- This prejudice was a major factor in Yosho leaving Jurai
- Some supported Funaho; others were "neutral or critical"

**Yosho's Earth Marriages:**
- First wife: Kasumi (Earth human, Funaho's niece he saved from Ryoko)
- Second wife: Airi (common law marriage, from planet Airai)
- These marriages were NOT recognized by Jurai
- Yosho doesn't care about Juraian approval

**Tenchi's Marriages (Canon):**
- Eventually marries SEVEN wives
- Includes: Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Mihoshi, Washu, Noike
- Political negotiations required
- Jurai eventually accepts due to Tenchi's cosmic significance

---

## Implications for Our Story

**Sheldon-Yosho Marriage Political Factors:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Same-sex | Not addressed in canon; unknown Juraian stance |
| Non-Juraian | Already precedent (Kasumi, Airi) |
| Yosho's status | Already self-exiled; doesn't seek approval |
| Royal implications | Yosho has already removed himself from succession |

**Key Insight:** Yosho explicitly left Jurai to escape political pressure. He married Earth women without Juraian approval and doesn't care about their opinion. A relationship with Sheldon would be consistent with this established pattern.

**Ayeka's Reaction:**
- Canon: Discovers Yosho is alive but aged (illusory), realizes she cannot marry him
- Our story: Discovers Yosho is alive AND in a relationship
- This requires additional processing but doesn't fundamentally change her eventual acceptance

**DECISION POINT:** Does Jurai learn about Sheldon during the political visits?

**Recommendation:** Yes. Queen Funaho (Yosho's mother, originally from Earth) learns about Sheldon during her visit (Episode 13). As a former Earth human herself, she's more understanding. Emperor Azusa may disapprove but has no leverage over Yosho.

# RESEARCH AREA 5: CHOUSIN AWARENESS

## Canon Facts (Verified)

**The Chousin Experiment:**
- Created multiverse to find being higher than themselves
- Each sister took different approach:
  - Tsunami: Planted seeds of Royal Trees, waited for Tenchi
  - Washu: Became mortal to analyze from within
  - Tokimi: Conducted experiments from hyperdimension
- Goal: Prove existence of Kami (God)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot perceive beings above their tier
- Cannot CREATE such a being
- Can only create conditions for one to emerge naturally
- Tenchi = successful result of experiment

**Inter-dimensional Awareness:**
- Tokimi controls 22-dimensional reality
- Washu operates in lower dimensions as mortal
- Tsunami merged with Sasami
- They are essentially Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent WITHIN their multiverse

**Cosmos vs. Chousin:**
- Cosmos: Final evolution of Sailor Moon universe deity
- Chousin: Creator goddesses of Tenchi Muyo universe
- Different cosmic hierarchies entirely
- No established crossover in canon

---

## Implications for Our Story

**Would the Chousin Notice Cosmos's Work?**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Detection capability | Can detect anomalies within their multiverse |
| Classification capability | Cannot classify entities from outside their cosmology |
| Immediate threat assessment | Sheldon is not hostile; low priority |
| Long-term interest | Puzzle worth studying, not emergency |

**Washu's Likely Response:**
1. Detects Sheldon's anomalous nature
2. Cannot classify power signature
3. Concludes: "Another god's work — but not Tsunami, not Tokimi, not... anyone I know"
4. Files as "fascinating puzzle for later study"
5. Does NOT escalate to cosmic threat level

**Tsunami's Position:**
- Merged with Sasami
- Aware of Washu's investigation
- May sense something "familiar yet foreign" about Sheldon
- Cosmic connection (both are expressions of feminine divine)
- Does NOT intervene unless Sheldon threatens household

**Tokimi's Interest:**
- Canon: Interested in Tenchi as experiment result
- Our story: Might notice second anomaly (Sheldon)
- Would investigate through agents (like Dr. Clay)
- Could add complexity to Dr. Clay arc

**DECISION POINT:** Does Tokimi send additional agents to investigate Sheldon?

**Recommendation:** No. Keep focus on canon events. Tokimi's interest remains on Tenchi. Sheldon is background noise in her experiment.

# SUMMARY: VERIFIED CANON CONSTRAINTS

| Element | Canon Fact | Story Impact |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Ryoko's observation | Cave entrance only | Limited knowledge of Sheldon |
| Washu's detection | Technology-based | Can detect anomaly, can't classify |
| Chousin perception | Limited to own cosmology | Cannot identify Cosmos |
| Zero infiltration | Perfect copy, emotional override | Stable household = calmer Zero |
