# SCENE 9.1: Before Dawn

**Date:** April 11, 1989 (Tuesday)  
**Time:** 05:00 - 05:45

Sheldon woke before the sun.

The darkness outside was not complete—a faint grey light was beginning to seep over the mountains to the east, the first hint of dawn filtering through the shoji screens. But it was early, earlier than he usually rose, the household still wrapped in silence.

Tanaka had said to come early. Dawn, he had said, when the weather was good. And the sky visible through the window suggested the weather would cooperate today—no clouds, no rain, just the clear stillness of a spring morning.

He dressed quietly, moving with care to avoid disturbing the others. The house made its usual sounds around him—the creak of old wood, the distant drip of water somewhere in the plumbing, the settling of a structure that had stood for generations—but no human sounds. Tenchi and Katsuhito were still asleep. Rea would not rise for another hour, when she would begin preparations for her school commute.

He left a note on the kitchen table, written carefully in his improving handwriting: *Gone to observe Tanaka-san's work. Will return for lunch.* Then he slipped out into the pre-dawn grey.

---

The shrine was different in the near-darkness.

The familiar shapes were all present—the torii gate, the stone lanterns, the great tree with its sacred rope—but they seemed larger somehow, more imposing. Shadows pooled in unexpected places, and the silence had a weight to it that the daytime bustle of birds and wind did not allow.

Sheldon paused at the top of the three hundred twenty steps, looking out over the landscape below. The village was invisible in the darkness, marked only by a few scattered lights—early risers, perhaps, or businesses preparing for the day. The sky was lightening moment by moment, deep blue giving way to paler shades at the horizon.

He thought about his grandmother, who had also been an early riser. "The best part of the day," she had called it. "When the world is quiet and you can hear yourself think."

He had not appreciated it then, had preferred to sleep until necessity dragged him from bed. But now, standing in the cool silence of pre-dawn, he understood. There was a quality to these hours that the rest of the day did not possess—a clarity, a stillness, a sense of possibility that faded once the world woke up.

The descent was careful in the dim light, each step requiring attention. The stone was damp with dew, slippery in places, and a fall here would be dangerous. He moved slowly, testing each placement, his body learning the steps in a new way.

By the time he reached the bottom, the sky had brightened enough to see by. The village was stirring—smoke rising from chimneys, doors opening, the first sounds of activity drifting through the streets. He nodded to an elderly man walking a small dog, received a curious look in return.

The Tsukino property was already alive with work.

# SCENE 9.2: Work Begins

Tanaka and his crew had been there for some time, judging by their progress.

The scaffolding from yesterday had been reinforced and extended, now reaching the full length of the north wall where the most serious damage lay. Materials had been unstaged and organized—tiles laid out in neat rows, tools arranged on portable workbenches, the various compounds and sealants ready for use.

Tanaka himself was on the roof, walking the tiles with the same careful attention Sheldon had observed the day before. But today his movements were different—more purposeful, more directed. He was not assessing; he was planning, working through the sequence of steps that would transform intention into action.

"Tsukino-san." Hayashi, one of the younger workers, noticed him first. "You came early, as Tanaka-sensei suggested."

"I did not want to miss anything."

"You are in time. We will begin the actual removal soon." Hayashi gestured toward the roof. "Once the damaged tiles are off, you will be able to see the underlayment—how it was constructed, how it failed, how we will repair it."

"Thank you for explaining."

"Tanaka-sensei instructed us to answer your questions. He says it is good to have someone interested in the traditional methods." Hayashi's expression suggested mild curiosity about why an American would care about Japanese roofing techniques, but he did not ask.

Sheldon found a position that would allow him to observe without being in the way—near the corner of the building where he could see both the roof and the staging area below. He settled in to watch.

---

The work began slowly, methodically.

Tanaka descended from the roof and gathered his crew for a brief conference—too quiet for Sheldon to hear clearly, but the gestures suggested they were reviewing the plan for the day. There was a rhythm to their discussion, the give-and-take of people who had worked together long enough to develop their own shorthand.

Then, with the coordination of people who had practiced their roles countless times, they began.

Ota went up first, carrying a canvas bag of tools. His climbing was economical—no wasted movements, each handhold and foothold chosen with precision. He positioned himself at the corner where the damage was worst, near where Sheldon had seen the stains on the ceiling below, and began the careful process of removing tiles.

Each one was lifted individually, the mortar beneath it loosened with a small flat tool that looked like a thick-bladed knife. The technique was precise—too much force and the tile might crack; too little and it would not come free. Ota seemed to find the exact pressure instinctively, each tile releasing with a soft grinding sound.

The freed tiles were checked for damage—held up to the light, tapped gently, examined for cracks both visible and hidden. Those that were salvageable went into one pile, lowered carefully to Hayashi below on a rope-and-pulley system. Those too cracked or worn to be trusted went into another pile, destined for disposal.

Watching, Sheldon realized that most were being saved. The visible damage—the three cracked tiles Tanaka had mentioned—was just the surface. Beneath, many more tiles were still sound, just shifted out of position by years of settling and the gradual movements of the house beneath them.

"The roof is like a puzzle," Hayashi explained, noticing Sheldon's attention. "Each tile fits with its neighbors in a specific way. When one shifts, it affects the others around it. Those shift further, affecting the ones around them. Over time, small movements accumulate into large problems."

"A cascade effect."

"Yes. What starts as a single tile moving a few millimeters becomes, over years, a pattern of displacement that extends across the entire roof section." Hayashi gestured at the exposed area. "You can see it now—how the tiles near the damage point are closer together than they should be, compressed by the shifting of their neighbors."

"So the repair is partly about repositioning?"

"Exactly. Some tiles need to be replaced, yes. But many just need to be returned to where they belong, with fresh mortar to hold them in place." He gestured at the pile of salvaged tiles. "We will clean these, check them for hidden cracks, remove the old mortar, and use them again. Traditional tiles last for generations if properly maintained."

Sheldon thought about the parallel to his own situation. He had been displaced, shifted out of his original position in space and time. Was he being repositioned now? Finding a new place where he fit, where his presence made the whole pattern work better?

It was a fanciful thought, but it resonated with something true.

The underlayment was exposed gradually as the tiles came off. Sheldon could see layers—first the tiles themselves, their curved shapes interlocking like fish scales, then a bed of mortar that had held them in place, then sheets of cedar bark arranged in overlapping patterns, then wooden boards that formed the structural base of the roof.

Each layer had a purpose, he realized. Each contributed something essential to the whole. Remove any one and the system would fail.

"The bark is the key," Hayashi said, following his gaze. "It is naturally waterproof and flexible. When water gets past the tiles—and it always does, eventually, through cracks or wind-driven rain—the bark channels it away before it can reach the wood beneath."

"But the bark in that corner has failed."

"Yes. You can see where it has compressed and cracked." Hayashi pointed to the exposed section, and Sheldon could indeed see the damage—the bark was darker there, more brittle-looking, with visible fissures that would allow water through. "When bark fails, water reaches the boards. The boards absorb it, swell, warp. Eventually rot sets in. We are fortunate that the damage was caught before it reached that point."

"How much longer before the rot would have started?"

"Another rainy season, perhaps two. The boards show discoloration but no softness yet. Another year of water infiltration would have changed that."

Tanaka joined them, having finished directing Ota's work on the upper sections.

"You are asking good questions," he said. "Most people do not care about what is beneath the surface. They see only the tiles, only the visible part of the roof."

"The tiles are what you see. The bark is what protects you."

"Precisely." Tanaka's expression suggested approval. "A roof is a system—many parts working together, each essential, each dependent on the others. Understanding one part without the others is incomplete understanding. To truly know a roof, you must know all of it."

"That seems like a philosophy that extends beyond roofing."

"All good craft extends beyond itself. The principles that make a good roofer also make a good carpenter, a good farmer, a good priest. Attention to detail. Respect for materials. Understanding of systems. Patience." He gestured toward the ongoing work. "These are not roofing skills—they are life skills. Roofing is simply where I learned them."

# SCENE 9.3: Morning Break

The morning passed in the rhythm of careful work.

Sheldon watched as the crew removed damaged materials, cleaned surfaces, prepared the area for reconstruction. Each step was deliberate, unhurried—there was an efficiency to their movements, but no rushing. Quality required time, and time was built into the process.

Around mid-morning, Tanaka called a break. The crew descended from the roof and gathered around a thermos of tea that someone had brought. Sheldon was invited to join them.

"You have been patient," Tanaka observed. "Most observers grow bored and leave."

"I am trying to understand. Boredom would mean I had stopped learning."

"A good philosophy." Tanaka sipped his tea. "What have you learned so far?"

Sheldon considered. "I have learned that traditional roofing is more complex than I assumed. I have learned that the visible elements—the tiles—are only part of the system, and perhaps not the most important part. I have learned that repair is not just about fixing what is broken but about understanding why it broke and preventing the same failure in the future."

"All correct. What else?"

"I have learned that the work requires patience. That rushing would compromise quality. That the crew's coordination comes from long practice, not just instruction."

Tanaka nodded slowly. "You see clearly. That is rare."

"My grandmother taught me to observe before judging. To understand before acting."

"She was wise."

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"Because it is true." Tanaka set down his tea. "Your grandmother and my grandfather would have understood each other. He taught me the same things—to look before you leap, to measure twice and cut once, to respect the materials and the work."

"Is that why you became a roofer?"

"Partly. It is the family trade—my grandfather taught my father, my father taught me. But I also chose it. The work suits me. I like being able to see the results of my labor, to know that what I build will protect people for years to come."

"That is similar to why I became interested in repair work."

"The house?" Tanaka gestured toward the building behind them. "You intend to open a repair shop?"

"Eventually. When the restoration is complete. It seems like useful work—something the village needs."

"It does need it. Since Hideo-san stopped working, people have had to go to the city for repairs. Many things go unfixed because the trip is too much trouble." Tanaka's expression was thoughtful. "You would be welcomed. But you would also need to earn trust."

"I understand that."

"Do you? Trust is not given quickly here. The village is old, the families are old, the relationships are old. A newcomer—especially a foreign newcomer—must prove himself over time. Years, perhaps."

"I am prepared to take that time."

"Good. That is the right answer." Tanaka rose, signaling the end of the break. "Now, back to work. The underlayment replacement begins next. You will want to watch closely."

# SCENE 9.4: Underlayment

**Date:** April 11, 1989 (Tuesday)

The underlayment work was, as Tanaka had promised, educational.

The damaged cedar bark was removed in sections, each piece examined before disposal to understand how it had failed. Some pieces had simply degraded with age—the natural oils that made the bark waterproof had dried out over decades, leaving the material brittle and permeable. Other pieces had been damaged by movement, cracked where tiles had shifted and put pressure on the layers beneath.

"This bark is perhaps sixty years old," Tanaka said, holding up a section for Sheldon to see. "It has done its job well. But nothing lasts forever."

"Where does the replacement bark come from?"

"There is a supplier in Kyoto who specializes in traditional materials. The bark is from a specific type of cedar, harvested and prepared according to methods that have not changed in centuries." Tanaka set down the old bark and lifted a new piece for comparison. "See the difference? The new bark is darker, more flexible. The oils are still fresh. It will take years to cure fully, but during that time, it will bond with the surrounding materials and become part of the roof."

The installation was methodical. Hayashi and Ota worked from the bottom up, laying each piece with careful attention to overlap. The edges had to align precisely—too much overlap and the roof would be uneven; too little and water might find its way through.

"We use no adhesive," Tanaka explained. "The bark holds itself in place through friction and geometry. Each piece locks with its neighbors. When all pieces are in place, the system is self-supporting."

"Like the joints in Japanese carpentry."

"Exactly. The same principles apply. You create structures that hold together through their own design, not through external fasteners that can fail."

Sheldon thought about this as he watched the work continue. In his scientific career, he had worked with systems—complex arrangements of components that produced emergent behavior. A roof was simpler than the experiments he had designed, but the underlying logic was similar. Understand the relationships, optimize the interactions, create something greater than the sum of its parts.

Perhaps all skilled work shared this quality. Perhaps excellence in any field required the same fundamental understanding of how things fit together.

---

By late morning, the underlayment repair was well underway.

The new cedar bark was being installed with the same methodical care that characterized all their work. Each piece was positioned precisely, its overlap measured and adjusted, its edges aligned with its neighbors. The crew worked in silence mostly, communicating through gestures and the occasional brief word.

Sheldon excused himself reluctantly—he had promised to return for lunch, and the walk back up the three hundred twenty steps would take time. But he had seen enough to understand the basic process, and Tanaka had invited him to return tomorrow when the actual tile work would begin.

"Tomorrow will be more interesting," the roofer promised. "Today is foundation work—important but not dramatic. Tomorrow, you will see the craft."

"I look forward to it."

"Bring questions. The tile work is complex—there are techniques I have not even touched on yet. Cutting tiles to fit around edges. Setting them at the proper angle. Ensuring the overlap is consistent." Tanaka's voice carried the enthusiasm of someone who genuinely loved their work. "The tiles are what people see. They must be perfect."

# SCENE 9.5: Village Recognition

Sheldon bowed his thanks and headed toward the village street.

The village was fully awake now, the streets busy with the ordinary traffic of a weekday morning. Housewives moved between shops, shopping bags in hand. An elderly man sat on a bench near the temple, reading a newspaper. Children's voices echoed from the school building, released for a morning break.

He walked through familiar territory—past Ito-san's grocery store, where she waved through the window; past the temple, where the priest was sweeping fallen petals from the stone steps; past houses and shops he was beginning to recognize. Each building had its own character now, its own place in his mental map of the village.

Near the start of the shrine path, he encountered Nakamura-san—the elderly man who had known Hideo, who had offered to share stories about the village's past.

"Tsukino-san." The old man's greeting was warm. "I heard you were watching the roof work this morning."

"News travels quickly."

"In a village this size, everything travels quickly." Nakamura-san's eyes crinkled with amusement. "Tanaka's apprentices are not known for their discretion. By noon, everyone will know that the American spent the morning asking questions about underlayment."

"I hope that is not a problem."

"Problem? No, no—quite the opposite. People are impressed. They say you are taking the restoration seriously, learning the proper methods instead of just paying someone else to handle it." He nodded approvingly. "That is how Hideo-san would have done it. He insisted on understanding everything about his house, even the parts he could not do himself."

"I am trying to honor what he built."

"You are succeeding." Nakamura-san shifted his weight, leaning more heavily on his cane. "When you have time—when the roof work is finished—come visit me. I have photographs of the house as it was in Hideo-san's prime. Before his wife died, before he withdrew from the world. You would learn much from them."

"I would like that very much."

"Good. I will expect you." The old man continued on his slow way, leaving Sheldon with more to think about.

---

He felt like he belonged here.

It was a strange sensation, one he had rarely experienced in his previous life. His scientific work had been isolating by nature—long hours alone with equations, collaborations that were professional rather than personal, relationships that existed in service of the work rather than for their own sake. He had told himself this was what excellence required, what the work demanded.

Here, walking through a village where people nodded to him by name, where his presence was expected rather than surprising, where even casual encounters carried warmth, he felt connected in a way that was unfamiliar and deeply satisfying.

Was this what he had been missing? All those years of solitary achievement, had he been depriving himself of something essential?

The climb up the three hundred twenty steps was hard, as always. His legs had adapted to the daily ascents, but the effort remained real. Each step was a choice, a commitment to the life he was building at the top of this mountain.

Halfway up, he paused to catch his breath and look back at the village below. Small buildings, narrow streets, green rice paddies stretching toward the distant hills. A landscape that had looked essentially the same for centuries, that would likely look the same for centuries more.

He was part of it now, in some small way. Part of its daily rhythms, its seasonal ceremonies, its ongoing story. The thought was both humbling and exhilarating.

# SCENE 9.6: Lunch with Katsuhito

Lunch was simple: rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables.

Katsuhito had prepared it while Sheldon was away, supplementing what Rea had left before her early departure. The old man listened with apparent interest as Sheldon described what he had observed.

"Tanaka is a good teacher," Katsuhito said. "He does not often take students—his sons went to university instead of learning the trade—but he has the instinct for it."

"He seems to enjoy explaining the work."

"He enjoys finding people who want to learn. There is a difference." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "The traditional crafts are dying. Young people go to the cities, take office jobs, forget the skills their grandparents knew. Tanaka sees this, mourns it, tries in his small way to preserve what he can."

"Is that why he invited me to observe?"

"Partly. He also genuinely likes you—I can tell by how he speaks of you. You showed respect for the work before you understood it. That matters to craftsmen."

Sheldon considered this. In his scientific career, he had often been impatient with preliminary explanations, eager to skip to the complex material. The idea that respect for fundamentals was itself a form of expertise was new to him.

"What will you do this afternoon?" Katsuhito asked.

"I thought I would work on the fort with Tenchi, after he returns from school. Yesterday we did not have time."

"Good. The boy has been talking about the fort constantly. He will be pleased."

"Has he mentioned the kittens?"

Katsuhito's expression suggested mild suffering. "He has mentioned little else. Apparently, the orange one is 'exactly like Marmalade' and would be 'the perfect pet' for our household."

"I apologize if my story contributed to this campaign."

"You are not responsible for his enthusiasm. Tenchi finds reasons for wanting things; he does not need them provided." The old man rose to clear the dishes. "We will discuss the matter when the time comes. For now, diversion is the better strategy."

# SCENE 9.7: Afternoon Practice

**Date:** April 11, 1989 (Tuesday)  
**Time:** 13:00 - 15:00  
**Location:** Engawa → Guest room  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,200

---

The afternoon stretched ahead, quiet and unscheduled.

Sheldon spent part of it in practice—the *seishin tōitsu* that Katsuhito had introduced. He found a quiet corner of the engawa, where the afternoon sun created a warm patch on the wooden planks, and sat.

The position itself was challenging—he was not used to sitting cross-legged for extended periods, and his hips protested the configuration. But Katsuhito had said that the discomfort was part of the practice, that learning to observe the body's complaints without reacting to them was itself a form of training.

He closed his eyes and tried to narrow his attention to the present moment.

It was harder today than it had been yesterday. The mind wanted to review what he had learned at the house—the layers of the roof, the techniques for removing tiles, the philosophy Tanaka had shared about craft extending beyond itself. It wanted to plan for tomorrow's observation, to catalogue the questions he should ask. It wanted to think about the repair shop and what it would require, about the conversations with Nakamura-san and Ito-san, about the web of relationships he was building.

Each time a thought arose, he acknowledged it and let it go, returning to the sensation of breath, the feeling of wood beneath him, the sound of wind in the trees.

The breath was the anchor, Katsuhito had said. Not something to force or control, just something to observe. Breathing happened whether you attended to it or not; the practice was simply to attend, to notice the rise and fall, the slight pause between inhale and exhale.

Progress was incremental. Minutes of focus punctuated by minutes of wandering. But the practice felt valuable anyway—a training of attention that would serve him in everything else. Each time he noticed his mind had wandered and brought it back, he was exercising a muscle. Each return was itself the practice, not a failure of it.

His grandmother had done something similar, he realized. Not meditation in the formal sense, but a quality of presence that allowed her to focus completely on whatever task was at hand. When she gardened, she gardened. When she cooked, she cooked. When she sat on the porch in the evening, she sat fully, not reaching for the next thing but simply being where she was.

He had not understood this as a skill. Had thought she was simply less ambitious, less driven, less interested in the larger questions that had always consumed him. Now he recognized it as a form of mastery—the ability to be fully present, to engage completely with the moment rather than always reaching toward something else.

His scientific work had required concentration, but it was a different kind. The concentration of analysis, of problem-solving, of pushing toward understanding. This was simpler—the concentration of simply being, of accepting what was present without trying to change or understand or improve it.

Could he learn this? At forty-three—or twenty-three, depending on how you counted—could he develop habits that had eluded him for decades?

He thought perhaps he could. The warmth in his chest seemed to agree, stirring slightly in what felt like encouragement. It was quiet most of the time now, this warmth, present but not demanding. Perhaps it too was learning patience, learning to simply be rather than always reaching for something more.

# SCENE 9.8: Rea Returns

The sound of the entrance sliding open broke his reverie—Rea returning from her long commute.

She appeared in the doorway a moment later, still in her school uniform, her bag heavy on her shoulder. Today she looked less tired than yesterday, the trains apparently cooperating.

"Good afternoon," she said. "The roof work—how does it progress?"

"Well. The underlayment is being replaced. Tomorrow they begin the tiles."

"That is good news." She set her bag down and began changing into house clothes, her movements automatic with routine. "Tenchi will be home soon. The bus was delayed slightly."

"He mentioned wanting to work on the fort."

"He has mentioned little else." A ghost of a smile. "The fort and the kittens. His two obsessions."

"At least they are productive obsessions."

"The fort is productive. The kittens are a campaign of attrition." But her voice carried no real complaint. "I will start dinner preparations. Tenchi will want your attention when he arrives."

Sheldon nodded, rising from his spot on the engawa. The household was expanding again, the contracted quiet of the school hours giving way to the fuller presence of evening.

# SCENE 9.9: Fort Work

**Date:** April 11, 1989 (Tuesday)  
**Time:** 17:30 - 19:00  
**Location:** Forest → Fort site  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,800

Tenchi arrived with his usual energy, bursting through the door with news about school and friends and the ongoing kitten saga.

"The orange one has a name now! Yamamoto-san's daughter named it Mikan because it's orange like a tangerine. Isn't that perfect? And she said we can visit maybe this weekend if the kittens are big enough."

"That sounds promising."

"It's very promising. Mom would have said it was fate." Tenchi's voice carried certainty. "She believed in fate. She said things happen for reasons, even when we don't understand them."

"Your mother was wise."

"Everyone says that." He tugged at Sheldon's sleeve. "Come on, let's work on the fort before dinner. The roof needs fixing after the rain."

They walked into the forest together, following the now-familiar path to the fort site. The structure had weathered the previous day's rain reasonably well, but Tenchi was right—the leaf-and-branch roof had flattened in places, some sections showing gaps where water might seep through.

"We need to rebuild these parts," Sheldon said, examining the damage. "The weight of the wet leaves compressed them."

"Is that what happens to real roofs too? Is that why Tanaka-san has to fix the house?"

"Similar, yes. Water is heavy, and over time it presses down on materials that were not designed to bear that weight. The roof of the house has tiles that are supposed to shed water before it can accumulate. But when the tiles shift or crack, water gets underneath."

"And then it gets heavy and pushes things down?"

"Exactly. And it also rots wood, which weakens the structure further. It is a cascade effect—one problem leading to another, each making the next one worse."

Tenchi nodded seriously, clearly filing this information away. "So we need to make our roof shed water better. Like real tiles."

"We cannot make tiles, but we can layer the leaves more carefully. Each layer should overlap the one below it, like fish scales, so water runs off instead of soaking through."

"Show me how."

They worked together, Sheldon demonstrating the technique while Tenchi watched intently. The boy learned quickly, his small hands surprisingly deft at positioning the leaves and branches.

"This is like what you saw at the house today," Tenchi said. "Layers."

"Yes. The same principle. Each layer protects the ones beneath it."

"And if one layer fails?"

"Then the next layer has to work harder. And if that one fails too, eventually the water reaches something it can damage."

"And the branches would get wet and maybe rot?"

"Eventually, yes. Though branches are more resistant than the leaves. The point is that each layer protects the next. When one layer fails, the others are exposed."

They worked together for the next hour, removing flattened leaves, gathering fresh materials from the forest floor, rebuilding the sections of roof that needed attention. The work was not difficult—simple labor that occupied the hands while leaving the mind free for conversation.

Tenchi talked about school, about his friends, about the ongoing saga of the kittens. The orange one had opened its eyes yesterday, apparently, and was "the cutest thing I've ever seen, even cuter than Kabutaro, and you know how cute Kabutaro is."

"I do know," Sheldon agreed. "You have mentioned his cuteness several times."

"He's very cute. But the kitten might be cuter. I haven't decided yet." Tenchi carefully positioned a large leaf, overlapping it with its neighbors as Sheldon had demonstrated. "Is this right?"

"Almost. Angle it a bit more—you want the water to run off, not pool in the crease."

"Like this?"

"Perfect."

They continued in comfortable rhythm, each finding their role in the work. Tenchi gathered materials and placed them according to Sheldon's instructions; Sheldon checked the placements and made adjustments where needed. It was collaboration without hierarchy, shared effort toward a common goal.

"Momoko wants one of the kittens too," Tenchi said, after a while. "A grey one. But her mother says they can't have pets because of her father's allergies."

"That is unfortunate."

"I told her she could visit our kitten whenever she wanted. If we get one. Which we should. Because it would be good for the shrine."

"How would a kitten be good for the shrine?"

"Shrines have cats all the time! I've seen pictures. The cats chase away mice and look decorative and... and help with prayers."

"Help with prayers?"

"Maybe. I'm not sure about that part. But definitely the mice." Tenchi's voice carried the conviction of someone who had thought through their argument carefully. "And cats are calming. People like to pet cats. It would make visitors feel more welcome."

"We do not have many visitors."

"We might have more if we had a cat."

Sheldon had to admit there was a certain logic to the argument. Though he suspected Tenchi was working backward from the desired conclusion to the supporting reasons—a technique he recognized from his own younger years.

"These are all points for discussion," he said neutrally. "When the time comes."

"The time will come soon. The kittens are almost old enough."

"And your grandfather will make the decision."

"Maybe you could help convince him?"

"I do not think interfering in household decisions is appropriate for a guest."

"But you're not just a guest. You're..." Tenchi trailed off, searching for the right word. "You're part of us now."

The simple statement struck Sheldon with unexpected force. Part of us. Not a guest, not a visitor, but part of the family.

"Even so," he said, his voice slightly rough, "the decision belongs to your grandfather."

Tenchi sighed with the weariness of someone who had tried every angle and found none of them workable. "Fine. But I'm not giving up."

"I would expect nothing less."

# SCENE 9.10: Tenchi's Fear

**Date:** April 11, 1989 (Tuesday)  
**Time:** 18:00 - 18:30  
**Location:** Fort site  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Word Target:** 1,200

As they worked, Tenchi's chatter gradually slowed, becoming more thoughtful.

"Tsukino-san? Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"When you came here—when you first arrived—were you scared?"

The question was unexpected. Sheldon considered how to answer.

"Yes," he said finally. "I was scared. I did not know where I was, or why I was here, or what was going to happen. Everything was unfamiliar."

"What did you do? When you were scared?"

"I did the next thing that needed to be done. I found food, found shelter, found people who could help me. I focused on the immediate problems because the larger questions were too big to answer all at once."

Tenchi nodded slowly, processing this.

"Mom was scared too, I think. Before she died. She tried to hide it, but I could tell." His voice was quiet, matter-of-fact. "She kept doing normal things—cooking dinner, helping with my homework, reading me stories. Even when she was scared."

"That is very brave. Doing normal things when you are scared."

"Is it?"

"Yes. Fear wants you to stop, to freeze, to wait for the danger to pass. Doing normal things despite the fear takes courage."

"Do you still do normal things when you're scared?"

"I try to. It is not always easy. But your mother was right—keeping to routines helps. It reminds you that life continues, that there are things worth doing, that the fear does not have to control you."

Tenchi was quiet for a moment, his hands still working on the roof covering.

"I get scared sometimes," he admitted. "At night, mostly. I think about Mom, and about how Grandpa is old, and about what would happen if..."

He did not finish the sentence. He did not need to.

"Those are real fears," Sheldon said carefully. "It is normal to have them. But I want you to know something. If anything happened to your grandfather—anything at all—I would not leave you alone. I would take care of you. For as long as you needed."

Tenchi looked up, his eyes bright. "You mean it?"

"I mean it. I cannot promise that nothing bad will ever happen—no one can promise that. But I can promise that you will not face it alone."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

The boy's small body relaxed slightly, some tension he had been carrying released. He returned to his work with renewed energy, as though the conversation had lifted a weight.

They finished the roof repairs and began work on the walls, placing larger branches to create wind barriers. The structure was becoming more substantial now—recognizably a fort, a place of shelter and security.

"It's really good," Tenchi said, stepping back to admire their work. "Better than any fort I've seen in books."

"You have seen many forts in books?"

"Some. Castles, mostly. But this is better because it's real."

"Reality does have certain advantages."

They returned to the house as the afternoon light was beginning to fade.

Katsuhito met them at the door, his expression suggesting he had been tracking their activities.

"The fort progresses?"

"The fort progresses excellently," Tenchi announced. "We fixed the roof and started the walls. Soon it will be the best fort in the whole prefecture."

"An ambitious claim."

"An achievable claim," Tenchi corrected. "With enough work."

Bath time followed, then the familiar routine of dinner preparation. Sheldon helped in the kitchen, his role now established—he washed and chopped vegetables while Rea handled the rice and Katsuhito managed the more complex tasks.

"You spoke with him," Katsuhito said quietly, while Tenchi was occupied elsewhere. "About serious things."

"He asked about fear. About what happens when people you love..."

"Ah." The single syllable carried understanding. "He worries about that. More than he shows."

"I told him I would take care of him. If anything happened."

Katsuhito was silent for a moment. Then, without looking up from his work: "Thank you. For saying that. For meaning it."

"I do mean it."

"I know. That is why I am thanking you."

Dinner was fish and rice and vegetables, eaten in the comfortable rhythm that had become their custom.

Tenchi dominated the conversation initially, describing the fort in elaborate detail, outlining plans for future expansion. But eventually his energy flagged, the day's activities catching up with him.

"Bed," Katsuhito said, when Tenchi's head began to droop. "No arguments."

"I'm not... that tired..."

"The yawning suggests otherwise."

Tenchi went without protest, too exhausted to maintain his usual resistance. Sheldon helped him into pajamas, supervised teeth-brushing, settled him into his futon with Usagi-chan.

"Tsukino-san?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you. For the promise."

"You are welcome. Sleep now."

The boy was asleep almost instantly, his breathing evening out, his small face peaceful.

Sheldon sat with him for a few minutes, as he had begun to do each night. Watching him sleep, thinking about the trust that had been placed in him, feeling the weight of his promise.

He would keep it. Whatever else happened, whatever the warmth had planned, he would keep this promise.

---

Rea was cleaning the kitchen when Sheldon returned, her movements efficient despite the long day.

"He told you his fears," she said quietly. It was not a question.

"He did."

"He has not spoken of them to anyone. Not since Kiyone-sama died." Her hands continued their work, but her attention was on Sheldon. "What did you tell him?"

"That I would take care of him. If anything happened to Katsuhito-sama."

Rea was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was carefully neutral. "That is a large promise."

"I know."

"Do you understand what it would mean? To raise a child? To be responsible for his education, his health, his future?"

"I understand it is more than I can fully imagine. But I made the promise knowing that." Sheldon met her eyes. "I will not break it."

Something shifted in her expression—not quite acceptance, but perhaps the beginning of it. "Kiyone-sama would have approved. She always said that promises made to children were sacred. That breaking them taught children the world could not be trusted."

"She was wise."

"Everyone says that." But Rea's voice carried warmth now, the defensive edge fading. "I think perhaps you understand why."

# SCENE 9.13: Engawa Conversation

Later, on the engawa, Sheldon sat with Katsuhito in the darkness.

The stars were brilliant tonight, the sky clear and cold. The Milky Way stretched overhead, a river of light flowing across the heavens. In the silence, each sound seemed amplified—the chirp of crickets, the rustle of wind in the great tree, the distant call of an owl.

"The boy talked to you about his fears," Katsuhito said. "That is significant."

"I was surprised. He has not mentioned such things before."

"He does not mention them to anyone. Not even to me." The old man's voice was thoughtful. "He carries more than he shows. The loss of his mother... it left wounds that have not fully healed."

"How could they? She died when he was so young."

"Young, yes. But not too young to understand. Not too young to grieve." Katsuhito was quiet for a moment. "He saw her decline. Saw her grow weak, saw her pain, saw her try to hide it for his sake. That is a heavy burden for a child."

"He said she was scared but kept doing normal things."

"She did. She was determined that he would have as much normalcy as possible, for as long as possible. Right up until the end, she was reading him stories, checking his homework, pretending everything was fine." The old man's voice cracked slightly. "She was very brave. Braver than I knew how to be."

"You were brave too. You took care of him. You have taken care of him ever since."

"Necessity. Not bravery. A child needed someone. I was the only one available." But there was something in his tone that suggested the distinction mattered less than he pretended.

They sat in silence for a while, the weight of the conversation settling around them.

"You made him a promise," Katsuhito said finally. "About taking care of him. If something happens to me."

"Yes."

"Did you mean it?"

"I meant it."

"Good." The old man's voice was firm. "I am not planning to die soon—I have too much work to do—but it is good to know that he would not be alone. That someone would be there."

"I will be there. For as long as he needs."

"That may be a long time."

"I have time."

Katsuhito turned to look at him in the darkness. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy him.

"You are becoming part of this family," he said. "Not just a guest, not just a helper. Part of it."

"I am trying."

"You are succeeding." A rare warmth in the old man's voice. "I did not expect this, when you arrived. Did not expect to trust you so quickly, to include you so readily. But here we are."

"Here we are."

The stars wheeled overhead, indifferent and eternal. The crickets sang their endless song. The warmth in Sheldon's chest hummed quietly, acknowledging something—the progress, perhaps, or the promises being made.

Nine days. Just over a week. And already, he had found something he had not known he was looking for.

A family. A purpose. A place to belong.

Tomorrow there would be more work on the roof, more learning about the craft. Tenchi would go to school and come home with more stories about kittens. The routines would continue, the relationships would deepen, the life he was building would become more solid.

But tonight, in the darkness with the stars overhead, Sheldon allowed himself to feel what he felt without analysis or reservation.

Gratitude. Connection. Hope.

The warmth wrapped around him like a blanket, gentle and constant, as though confirming what he already knew.

He was home.
