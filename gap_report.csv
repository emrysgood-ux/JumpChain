# SECTION 4: RAG-STYLE QUERY TEMPLATES

## The ""Evidence-Based"" Query

**When searching for facts:**

```
QUERY: [Did Rea and Tenchi interact before Sheldon arrived?]

FORMAT: 
- List every scene mention
- The day/scene number
- The specific action or dialogue
- Verification status (Canon / Story / Inferred)

OUTPUT: Table showing Scene | Context | Verification Status
```

## The Conflict Audit

**When checking new content against canon:**

```
INPUT: [Paste new scene] + [Paste relevant Bible section]

TASK: Audit for ""System Violations""
- Character presence errors (is Rea missing?)
- Knowledge boundary violations (does Sheldon know something he shouldn't?)
- Timeline inconsistencies (is the date/time correct?)
- Household composition errors (wrong number of people?)

OUTPUT: Pass/Fail with specific violations listed
```

## The Character Voice Consistency Test

```
INPUT: [Paste 3 sample dialogues from existing scenes] + [Paste new dialogue]

ANALYSIS:
- Sentence length comparison
- Vocabulary level match
- Age-appropriate speech (Tenchi is 4, speaks simply)
- Honorific usage (Japanese formality)

GRADE: 1-10 consistency score with specific notes
```

# SECTION 5: RIPPLE EFFECT TEMPLATES

## The Cascade Tracker

When ANY fact changes, trace the ripple:

```
CHANGE: Kiyone's death date moved from 1988 to 1986-1987

RIPPLE ANALYSIS:

1. IMMEDIATE EFFECTS:
   - Tennyo left Earth 1-2 years earlier
   - Tenchi's grief period is longer
   - Rea has been helping raise Tenchi longer
   
2. DOCUMENT UPDATES REQUIRED:
   - Tenchi_Masaki.md (death date reference)
   - Nobuyuki_Masaki.md (death date reference)
   - Rea_Masaki.md (timeline)
   - Complete_Family_Trees.md (death date)
   - Year_By_Year_Complete.md (context)
   - All Day files (grief references)
   
3. EMOTIONAL CONSEQUENCES:
   - Tenchi (age 4) has dimmer memories of mother
   - Nobuyuki has had longer to process grief
   - Household routines more established
   
4. VERIFICATION:
   - Check all documents in DEPENDENCY_MATRIX
   - Run V1 pass on updated docs
   - Confirm no contradictions remain
```

## The ""Bad Faith Reader"" Stress Test

```
PROMPT: Act as a hostile reader trying to break continuity.

TARGET: [Day 1 dinner scene]

ATTACKS:
1. ""Why is there no teenage girl at dinner if Rea lives here?""
2. ""Who cooked? You say Katsuhito but Rea is the cook.""
3. ""3 people eating but you said 4 live here?""
4. ""Where's Nobuyuki? Oh right, weekday. Did you establish that?""

DEFENSE REQUIRED: Answer each attack with canon/story justification

## PART III: NARRATIVE-COMPREHENSIVE FILE CONTRADICTIONS

### Day 16 Case Study

**Comprehensive File (day_016_comprehensive.md) says:**
- ""Repair Project (09:00-15:00)"" - Sheldon learns carpentry

**Narrative File (day_16_narrative.md) says:**
- NO mention of repair project
- NO mention of carpentry
- Different events entirely

**VERDICT:** These files describe DIFFERENT days. One or both are wrong.

### Pattern Across Days

| Day | Comprehensive Key Event | Narrative Key Event | Match |
|-----|------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 4 | Cooking Debut | Cooking mentioned | ✅ |
| 5 | Village Visit (320 steps) | Village mentioned | ✅ |
| 6 | Cave Mention | Cave mentioned | ✅ |
| 14 | Nobuyuki Visit | Nobuyuki mentioned | ✅ |
| 16 | Shrine Repairs | NO repairs | ❌ CONFLICT |
| 18 | Kiyone Revelation | Needs verification | ❓ |

## PART IV: CONTENT QUALITY ISSUES

### Placeholder Template Text

**8 of 12 scenes in Day 16 narrative use identical template:**

```
""The day continued with [ACTIVITY], a rhythm that was becoming increasingly 
familiar. Sheldon moved through the tasks with growing confidence, each 
action building on the foundation of days past.

Characters present: [NAMES].

The [LOCATION] provided the backdrop for these moments, its details now 
as familiar as they had once been strange. 

Time passed in the way time does—measured in small accomplishments...""
```

**Scenes Using This Template:**
- Scene 16.2 (06:35-08:13)
- Scene 16.3 (08:13-09:19)
- Scene 16.5 (10:32-13:12)
- Scene 16.6 (13:12-14:01)
- Scene 16.7 (14:01-14:28)
- Scene 16.8 (14:28-15:39)
- Scene 16.10 (16:53-17:09)
- Scene 16.12 (18:20-18:39)

**THIS IS NOT NARRATIVE PROSE - IT IS PLACEHOLDER CONTENT**

### Duplicate Content

**Scenes 16.9 and 16.10 contain IDENTICAL text** (the rock collecting conversation).

### Hallucinated Character

**Scene 16.11 references ""Itsuki"":**
