**Document Version:** 2.0 (Research-Verified)  
**Compiled:** December 29, 2025  
**Scope:** Death → Arrival → Pre-Canon → Canon → Post-Canon → Departure  
**Sources:** 15+ past conversations, Story Bible v6+, Celestial Pack Reference, Canon Audits

## PART I: JUMP MECHANICS EXTRACTION

### 1.1 Jump Structure (Per Source Document)

The Tenchi Muyo! Jump offers **Two Jumps in One**:

| Mode | Duration | Starting CP | Drawback Cap |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Slice of Life | 10 years | +1000cp | +400cp |
| Space Opera | 10 years | +800cp | +800cp |
| Endgame | 10 years | 0cp (one free Ultimatum perk) | N/A |

**Standard Completion Path:**
- Complete Slice of Life OR Space Opera (10 years)
- Return for the other mode (10 more years)
- After 20 years total: Eligible for Endgame Scenario
- Maximum standard duration: **30 years**

**STORY FRAMEWORK:**
The 1000-year duration indicates Sheldon chose **"This Side Up"** (stay for lifetime) with Cosmos arranging special departure conditions. The Jump framework provides his power scaffolding, but his arrangement with Cosmos supersedes standard Jump completion timelines.

---

### 1.2 Sheldon's Origin: DROP-IN

Based on story circumstances (human from Earth, arrived mysteriously via Cosmos), Sheldon is a **Drop-In**:

**Drop-In Benefits:**
- No extra memories to confuse identity
- Can handwave equipment as "from some other system"
- Automatically learns Japanese
- No institutional blindness (sees solutions others miss)

**Drop-In Disadvantages:**
- No in-universe contacts or documentation
- Must explain abilities/equipment through fast talking or stealth
- No established identity or resources

---

### 1.3 Perk Analysis (Drop-In Track)

| Cost | Perk | Slice of Life Effect | Space Opera Effect |
|------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 100cp | **Trained in the Old Ways** | Unexpected methodology, sees interesting solutions | Wildcard common sense for big problems |
| 200cp | **Civilian Savvy** | Street-smarts, adapts quickly to new situations | Logistics mastery, respected by middle managers |
| 400cp | **Exceptional Company** | Best of best gravitate toward you; engaged to 2+ nobles | Rub elbows with high society; date 2+ exceptional people weekly |
| 600cp | **The UnChousin One** | Ignored by higher beings, concealment from prognostics | Talent for disrupting plans, spotting hidden elements |
| 800cp | **Long Lost Last Noble Heir to the Dojo** | Inherited titles, bloodlines, seats on councils | Only holder of lost skill/combat art; once-per-opponent instant technique |

**SPECULATION FOR SHELDON'S BUILD:**
Given Cosmos's involvement and his role as her "first son," likely perks:
- **The UnChousin One** (concealment from Chousin observation)
- **Exceptional Company** (explains why best characters gravitate to him)
- **Long Lost Noble Heir** (Tsukino family represents genuine bloodline via Cosmos)

---

### 1.4 Ultimatum Perks (Post-20 Years)

These unlock after completing both Slice of Life and Space Opera modes:

| Perk | Powers Granted |
|------|----------------|
| **What Has Science Done?!** | Ryoko's powers: self-duplication (2 copies within 50 yards), phasing through matter, regeneration (can restore total body mass dozens of times), energy swords, concussive blasts, merging with inanimate matter |
| **Dimensional Technology Mastery** | 5th-12th dimensional tech: subspaces, space-folding, vast pocket dimensions, escape from higher powers temporarily |
| **Wings of the Lighthawk** | Manifest LHW without treeship: starts at 1 wing, trains to 3 by end of 10 years. Wings defend against infinite minor attacks, can convert to armor/weapons with Planck-length edges |

**FOR STORY:** Sheldon's path to 13 Lighthawk Wings suggests **Wings of the Lighthawk** as his Ultimatum selection, with additional growth via Celestial Pack grants.

---

### 1.5 Relevant Gear Options

| Item | Cost | Effect | Story Relevance |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Smiling Goddess Leaves** | 400cp (Jurian) | 1st Gen Sentient Tree sapling; halts aging of bonded companions; heals 3x faster; tree matures in 100 years | Potential longevity source |
| **Master Key** | 300cp (Drop-In discount) | Jurian artifact from 1st Gen tree; admin access to 2nd gen treeships; can generate energy sword and personal shield | Possible Cosmos-granted item |
| **Subspace Onsen** | 100cp | Infinite hot water retreat; connects to Warehouse; expands to infinite occupants | Potential relaxation space |
| **Control Cube** | 100cp (GP free) | Supertech interface; 3 cubic yards dimensional pocket; can hide dimensionally | Utility item |

---

### 1.6 Drawbacks (Potential Complications)

| Drawback | CP | Effect | Trigger |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **Hopeless Suitor** | +200cp | Someone wants to marry you; appears at Year 3 with wedding intentions | Story complication |
| **Multiple Spouses** | +200cp | Two fiances with feuding families | Escalation option |
| **Hunted** | +300cp | Galaxy-known super-criminal targets you starting Year 4 | Pre-canon tension |
| **God-Emperor of Jurai** | +300cp | Hostile Tenchi as Emperor, gains LHW each year from Year 4 | Would contradict story structure |
| **The OTHER Chousin One** | +750cp | You're an "Additional Tenchi" for million-year Chousin experiment | May explain Cosmos's interest |

**STORY NOTE:** "The OTHER Chousin One" aligns with Cosmos making Sheldon her "first son" — he may be her counter-move in the Chousin experiment.

---

### 1.7 Ending Options

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **No Need for You** | Return home after Jump completion |
| **This Side Up** | Stay for lifetime in Tenchi universe |
| **The Jumper Solution** | Take companions, continue JumpChain |

**SHELDON'S PATH:** "This Side Up" with Cosmos-arranged departure at Year 1000, approximately 3 months after Yosho's death (~2989).

---

## PART II: DUAL POWER SYSTEM

### 2.1 System Architecture

Sheldon operates under **TWO STACKING POWER SYSTEMS:**

| System | Source | Status at Arrival | Unlock Condition |
|--------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Jump Perks** | JumpChain document | LOCKED | Cosmos must establish communication (~Year 1 anniversary) |
| **Celestial Pack** | Cosmos grants (Grimoire, Forge, etc.) | ACTIVE | Granted strategically outside Jump structure |

**KEY INSIGHT:** Jump Perks represent the baseline framework. Celestial Pack grants represent Cosmos's strategic investments in her champion, operating independently of Jump rules.

|-------|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **I** | 1-5 | Exceptional Human | "Impressive but explainable" — "Grandmother taught him" |

|-------|-------|-------|-------|

**CRITICAL:** The 13-wing manifestation was a ONE-TIME emergency breach. Cosmos directly intervened to prevent multiversal collapse. Sheldon suffered severe strain and required extended recovery. He NEVER exceeds the 10-wing universal limit again.

|--------|-----------|---------|
| Year 1 | 2-3 times | Establishing contact |
| Years 2-5 | Monthly average | Regular conversations |
| Years 6-12 | Every 6-8 weeks | Reduced but stable |
| Crisis | Can sometimes push through | Emergency only |

**Dream Environment:** Always the same place: a white room with no walls. Sometimes moonflowers appear. Temperature is perfect. Time moves differently.

**VERIFIED SAMPLE DIALOGUE (Year 1 — The First Dream):**
> *He was somewhere white. Not a room—there were no walls—but a space that felt contained somehow. Warm. Safe.*
>
> *'Sheldon.'*
>
> *He turned. A woman stood there, silver-white hair flowing like starlight, dressed in white that seemed to glow from within. She was crying. She was smiling.*
>
> *'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I'm so sorry. There wasn't time to explain. There wasn't time for anything but catching you.'*
>
> *'Who—' His voice cracked. 'Who are you?'*
>
> *'I'm your mother now.' She reached for his face, and her touch felt like being loved. 'I'm Usagi. I'm Cosmos. I'm the one who couldn't let you go.'*

**COSMOS'S LIMITATIONS:**
| She CAN | She CANNOT |
|---------|------------|
| Reach him when conditions align | Appear at will |
| Provide emotional support | Give tactical information about Tenchi universe |
| Remind him of her love | Intervene physically |
| Sense his emotional state | Read specific thoughts |

**Sheldon calls her "Mom." She calls herself "Usagi."**

**VERIFIED DIALOGUE (from planning documents):**

> *Evening. Porch. Tea. Now tradition.*
>
> *Yosho: "Three years. You have earned my trust."*
>
> *Sheldon: "And you've earned mine."*
>
> *Yosho: "I know you are not ordinary. I have known since the first year. Your soul is old. Older than your body."*
>
> *Sheldon: "How long have you suspected?"*
>
> *Yosho: "Your reactions to Tenchi were too knowing. Too prepared. You speak of history as if you've lived it twice."*
>
> *Pause.*
>
> *Sheldon: "I died. In another life. I was a physicist. There was an accident."*
>
> *Yosho listens.*
>
> *"Someone called Cosmos. She... she made me her son. Gave me this life."*
>
> *Yosho: "Cosmos." He considers the name. "I do not know this being. But I know power. Yours is gentle. Growth-oriented."*
>
> *Pause.*
>
> *"I have my own unusual background. I was born on another world. I have lived in Japan for over seven hundred years. I am not human, though I have chosen to live as one."*
>
> *First mutual acknowledgment of being "other."*
>
> *Neither explaining everything. Both accepting.*

**YOSHO'S RESPONSE (Verified):**

| Yosho is 700+ years old | Prince status, Azusa, politics |
| Yosho recognizes otherworldly power | What's in the cave |
| His abilities are real, not imagination | Why Cosmos sent him HERE |
| They can be developed through training | Anything about Tenchi Muyo plot |

**RELATIONSHIP STATUS POST-REVELATION:**

| Relationship | Before | After |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Sheldon ↔ Yosho** | Trust complete; hints exchanged | **FULL ACKNOWLEDGMENT**: Both know the other is otherworldly; true peers |
| **Training** | Advanced beginning | Integrated practice; Juraian techniques |
| **Power** | Phase I (Dormant) | **Phase II** (Environmental effects; controlled) |

|------|---------------|-------|
| 13 | 1-3 (crisis) | Emerging |
| 14 | 2-3 (stable) | Post-Kagato |
| 15-16 | 3-4 | Developing |
| 17 | 4-5 | Pre-Shadow |
| 18 (Shadow) | **13 (ONE TIME)** | Cosmos intervention |
| 18 (Recovery) | 0→3 | Rebuilding |
| 19-40 | 4-10 | Gradual climb |
| 40+ | 10 max | **HARD CEILING** |

### 5.3 Canon Deviation Strategy

**Principle:** Enhance rather than replace

**What Changes:**
- Characters are NOT meeting Tenchi alone
- Sheldon's 12-year presence has created an **established family**
- Harem dynamic transforms into found family structure
- Female characters become "aunts" rather than romantic rivals
- Yosho and Sheldon are in a relationship by Year 13

**What Stays:**
- All major canon events still occur
- Character personalities remain authentic
- Core relationships (Tenchi with each character) develop
- Primary conflicts (Kagato, etc.) still happen

### 5.4 Character Arrival Integration (VERIFIED)

| Character | Canon Arrival | Story Adaptation |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Ryoko** | Cave awakening | **CONSCIOUS entire 700-year imprisonment**; watched household via astral projection for 12 years |
| **Ayeka** | Arrives seeking Yosho | Finds Yosho has a FAMILY; must process 700 years of searching ending differently |
| **Sasami** | With Ayeka | Kitchen dynamic: Two cooks. Mentorship + collaboration, not competition |
| **Mihoshi** | Crash landing | Galaxy Police introduction |
| **Washu** | Released from prison | **Special dynamic**: When she discovers Sheldon's true nature, gains scientific fascination (external cosmology!), cosmic kinship, protective interest |
| **Noike** | Later arrival | Integrates as family, not arranged bride |

### 5.5 The "Aunt Dynamic" (VERIFIED)

**Transformation from Canon:**
| Canon Structure | Story Structure |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Women arrive, compete for Tenchi | Women enter **established family** |
| Romantic tension | Aunt/sister dynamics |
| Tenchi can't choose | Nothing to choose — he has parents already |
| Rivals | Allies |

**Key Mechanism:** By 2001, Sheldon and Yosho are in a relationship. The household has structure, routines, and hierarchy. When canon characters arrive, they're integrated into an existing family system, not creating one from scratch.

### 5.6 Shadow Arc — The 13-Wing Incident (VERIFIED)

**Timeline:** ~2006-2007 (Sheldon's Years 17-18)

**Arc Order Context:** Kagato → Dr. Clay/Zero → Z/Chousin → **Shadow**

**What Happened:**
- Family threatened by Shadows (original storyline)
- Desperation triggers full Lambda inheritance
- Sheldon pushes to 13 wings — exceeding the 10-wing 3D maximum
- Reality begins destabilizing (multiversal collapse risk)
- **Cosmos intervenes** from outside to stabilize/prevent catastrophe
- Sheldon suffers severe strain; requires extended recovery

**Recovery Timeline:**
| Timeframe | Wing Capacity | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Immediately after | 0 | Unconscious, depleted |
| Weeks | 1-2 | Weakened, rebuilding |
| Months | 3 | Baseline restored |
| ~1 year | 4 | Stable with effort |
| Years | 5+ | Gradual climb |
| **Never again** | 11-13 | **Permanently off-limits** |

**PERMANENT RULE:** Sheldon's practical maximum going forward is **10 Light Hawk Wings** (universal limit). The 13-wing manifestation was a one-time emergency breach. He cannot and will not exceed 10 again.

---

## PART VII: DEPARTURE MECHANICS (VERIFIED)

### 7.1 The Endpoint: Yosho's Death

**The Death (VERIFIED DETAILS):**
- Natural death from old age (Juraian limit reached)
- Peaceful, surrounded by family
- Approximately **April 2989 AD**
- A spring morning. Cherry blossoms falling, as they did when Sheldon arrived 1,000 years before

- No visible aging—he looks as he did the day they met. But something within has simply... completed

### 7.2 The Final Years (2980-2989) — VERIFIED

**2980-2985: Intimate Time**

## PART VIII: CHARACTER ARC MAPPING (VERIFIED)

### 8.1 Sheldon × Yosho: Five-Phase Progression (VERIFIED)

| Phase | Years | Development |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | 1-3 | **ASSESSMENT**: Yosho observes, tests, evaluates. Sheldon proves himself through consistent action, patience, care for Tenchi. Trust earned, not given. |
| **2** | 4-12 | **TRUST**: Sheldon reveals reincarnation truth (Year 4). Yosho keeps his own secrets but offers training. Deep friendship forms. |
| **3** | 13-25 | **REVELATION**: Canon events force Yosho to reveal true identity. The "old priest" becomes young prince. Relationship must recalibrate. |
| **4** | 26-100 | **DEEPENING**: Both acknowledged immortals now. No more secrets. Romantic feelings can finally be explored without deception. |
| **5** | 100+ | **COMMITMENT**: Whatever form marriage takes for two immortals. Partnership across remaining centuries. |

**VERIFIED KEY MOMENTS:**
- **Year 4:** Sheldon's Truth — First major vulnerability shared
- **Year 5:** First time Yosho makes tea and brings it TO Sheldon
- **Year 7:** Kobe earthquake. They sit together that night. No words needed.
- **Year 9:** First time their hands touch and neither pulls away
- **Year 11:** Gift exchange. Yosho gives something with meaning. Sheldon understands.
- **Year 13:** Yosho's Truth — The great reversal; everything changes
- **Year 25:** First Admission — Feelings acknowledged
- **Year 36+:** Formal commitment. Yosho proposes using Bond-to-Ship gesture (Juraian tradition)
- **Year 50:** Physical relationship established
- **Year 100:** Full partnership confirmed

**STORY NOTE:** The romance CANNOT begin until Phase 3. Until Yosho drops the "old priest" illusion, Sheldon sees a mentor figure, not a potential partner. The revelation recontextualizes everything.

---

### 8.2 Sheldon × Tenchi: Father-Son Arc (VERIFIED)

| Year | Development Milestone |
|------|----------------------|
| 1 | **ATTACHMENT**: 4-year-old Tenchi latches onto available adult. Basic trust. Sheldon wasn't planning on being a father. |
| 2-3 | **BONDING**: Tenchi sees Sheldon as permanent fixture. "Fun uncle" becomes "parent figure." |
| 4-8 | **GROWTH**: Training partnership. Father-son dynamic established. Tenchi's academics and skills flourish. |
| 9-12 | **TEEN YEARS**: Normal independence phase. Sheldon shifts to background support. |
| 13+ | **EQUALS**: Canon events. Tenchi becomes hero. Sheldon as proud parent. |
| 20+ | **GENERATIONS**: Tenchi's own family. Sheldon as grandfather figure. |

**VERIFIED MOMENTS:**
- Day 8: **TENCHI'S NIGHTMARE** — First major bonding
- Week 2: Teaching Gift manifests — "You explain it better than teacher"
- Day 22: Tenchi's 5th Birthday — Parent role cemented
- Year 4: Training begins — Growth together
- Year 10: Legacy book — Tenchi writes down everything Sheldon has taught him

---

### 8.3 Sheldon × Cosmos: Mother-Son Arc (VERIFIED)

**Communication Frequency:**
| Period | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Year 1 | 2-3 times (establishing contact) |
| Years 2-5 | Monthly average |
| Years 6-12 | Every 6-8 weeks |
| Post-2001 | Can visit physically (limited duration) |

**Relationship Dynamic:**
- Sheldon calls her "Mom"
- She calls herself "Usagi" (asks him to use this name)
- Contact is precious because rare — neither can summon the other at will
- She cannot give tactical information about Tenchi universe
- She CAN provide emotional support, guidance, and love

**Key Development:** Year ~6-8 — The "Harem Complaint" scene:
> *"Question."*
> *Cosmos tilts her head. "Yes, my child?"*
> *Sheldon crosses his arms.*
> *"Why, exactly, did you put me in a universe with, and I'm counting, four different kinds of harems?"*
> *Cosmos blinks. Actually blinks.*
> *"Harems?" she repeats, like he just introduced her to a word invented five seconds ago.*
