## Scenes 51-100: Breakfast through Mid-Morning

---

**POV:** Masaki Katsuhito (Yosho Masaki Jurai)  
**Location Sequence:** Main House → Village Path → Kindergarten → Return Path → Shrine  
**Time Coverage:** 07:25 AM - 10:15 AM

## SCENE 51: SHELDON RETURNS DRESSED
**Time:** 07:25:33 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

Sheldon descended the stairs in borrowed clothing.

The outfit was mismatched—a yukata top over Western-style trousers, the combination suggesting limited options rather than deliberate choice. Katsuhito made a mental note to address the young man's wardrobe situation. The village would notice such details, and notice led to questions.

"Sheldon-san!" Tenchi bounced in his seat. "Grandpa says you might teach me to cook!"

Sheldon's expression softened in a way that Katsuhito found notable. The young man's guardedness, so apparent in adult interactions, seemed to dissolve in Tenchi's presence.

"I would be honored, Tenchi-kun. But your grandfather's permission comes first."

"He already said yes! He said if you agree, then—"

"Then we will discuss it properly." Katsuhito's voice carried the gentle authority that years of child-rearing had developed. "After breakfast."

---

## SCENE 52: THE MEAL BEGINS
**Time:** 07:28:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen table

Katsuhito served the miso soup first.

The bowls were family pieces—lacquerware that Kiyone had received as a wedding gift, used every morning since despite (or perhaps because of) the memories they carried. He placed one before each of them: Tenchi's smaller bowl, Sheldon's standard-sized, his own.

"Itadakimasu."

The word came naturally from Tenchi and himself. Sheldon's rendition arrived half a beat behind, the pronunciation careful, the meaning clearly understood.

---

## SCENE 53: OBSERVING SHELDON'S EATING
**Time:** 07:31:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen table

Sheldon ate with appropriate technique but visible thought.

The chopsticks moved correctly—never crossed, never used to point, transferred between hands with proper care when necessary. But each movement carried a quality of conscious execution rather than ingrained habit. The young man was performing competence, not expressing it.

Katsuhito understood the distinction intimately. He performed elderly frailty every moment of every day.

The soup, though. Sheldon's reaction to the soup was genuine. The young man's eyes closed briefly after the first sip, his expression shifting through surprise to appreciation to something approaching gratitude.

"This is excellent," Sheldon said. "The dashi has unusual depth."

"Overnight simmer. The technique is not difficult, but it requires patience."

"Patience seems to be a theme here."

Was that observation or veiled commentary? Katsuhito chose to interpret it as the former.

---

## SCENE 54: TENCHI'S MORNING ENERGY
**Time:** 07:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen table

Tenchi consumed his breakfast with typical four-year-old enthusiasm.

Rice entered his mouth in quantities that threatened choking. Soup splashed dangerously close to the bowl's edge. Pickled vegetables were examined suspiciously before reluctant acceptance.

"Small bites, Ten-chan."

"But I'm hungry!"

"Hungry is not an excuse for poor manners."

Tenchi's face scrunched into the particular expression of child-frustration that Katsuhito had come to find endearing rather than annoying. The boy slowed his consumption fractionally.

Sheldon watched the interaction with evident interest.

---

## SCENE 55: SHELDON'S QUESTION
**Time:** 07:38:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen table

"Katsuhito-san, I was hoping to visit the Tsukino house this morning."

The request was expected. Sheldon had expressed interest in the property yesterday, had seemed eager to assess its condition and begin planning whatever renovation he intended.

"Of course. I can provide directions, or accompany you if you prefer guidance."

"I would appreciate company, if it's not an inconvenience. The path seemed complex."

"The mountain has many paths. Learning them takes time." Katsuhito paused, considering options. "We could walk together after Tenchi is delivered to kindergarten."

"Kindergarten?"

Tenchi's head came up at the mention. "I go to school! Every day except Sunday and Saturday and when it rains really really hard!"

---

## SCENE 56: EXPLAINING THE ROUTINE
**Time:** 07:41:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen table

Katsuhito provided the context Sheldon's question implied.

"The village kindergarten operates five days each week. Tenchi attends from eight in the morning until two in the afternoon. The walk takes approximately twenty-five minutes—faster going down, slower returning."

"I see." Sheldon processed the information with visible cataloguing. "You make this journey twice daily?"

"The exercise is beneficial." Also the opportunity to maintain visibility in the village, to gather information through casual conversation, to monitor for any unusual activity that might require attention. "Ten-chan enjoys the walk."

"Sometimes I run!" Tenchi contributed. "Grandpa pretends he can't keep up but he always catches me."

Pretends. Even a four-year-old noticed the discrepancy between appearance and capability.

---

## SCENE 57: BREAKFAST CONCLUSION
**Time:** 07:48:33 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen table

The meal wound toward completion.

Tenchi finished first, his bowl scraped clean with the thoroughness of childhood appetite. Sheldon ate more slowly, seeming to savor each bite with the attention of someone for whom food was more than mere sustenance.

Katsuhito used the remaining minutes to observe.

The young man's hands had small calluses—signs of physical work, though the pattern didn't match any specific trade Katsuhito recognized. His fingernails were trimmed short and clean. His posture, despite the borrowed clothing's awkwardness, suggested someone accustomed to conscious body management.

Details. They accumulated into patterns. Patterns suggested meaning.

---

## SCENE 58: DISH DUTY
**Time:** 07:52:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

"Please, let me handle the dishes."

Sheldon had risen before Katsuhito could begin clearing, his hands already reaching for empty bowls. The offer carried the same quality as his breakfast assistance—genuine desire to contribute rather than social performance.

"You are a guest."

"I am an imposition." The correction came gently. "Guests bring gifts. I arrived empty-handed and hungry. The least I can do is wash dishes."

Tenchi giggled. "He said imposition! That's a big word!"

"It is," Sheldon agreed. "It means someone who causes trouble by being where they shouldn't be."

"You're not trouble!" Tenchi's objection was immediate and fierce. "You cook good and you're nice!"

---

## SCENE 59: ACCEPTING THE ASSISTANCE
**Time:** 07:55:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

Katsuhito allowed the dish duty to proceed.

Watching Sheldon wash dishes proved informative. The young man worked with efficient economy—no wasted motion, no unnecessary splashing, each bowl cleaned and rinsed and placed in the drying rack with methodical precision.

The technique suggested institutional experience. Hospital? Military? Some other environment where dish-washing had been systematized?

"You've done this before," Katsuhito observed.

Sheldon's hands paused fractionally. "I... yes. Though I don't remember specific circumstances. The motion feels familiar."

More memory gaps. The pattern was consistent.

---

## SCENE 60: TENCHI'S MORNING PREPARATION
**Time:** 08:02:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, Tenchi's room (supervised from hallway)

"Ten-chan, time to get ready."

Katsuhito guided his grandson upstairs while Sheldon finished the kitchen cleanup. The morning routine required a specific sequence: face washing, tooth brushing, hair combing, clothing change. Left unstructured, the process could stretch indefinitely as the boy found distractions in every corner.

Tenchi submitted to the routine with usual reluctance.

"Can Sheldon-san walk with us to school?"

"If he wishes, yes."

"Can he come inside the school? Can my friends meet him?"

"We will ask him."

The prospect of showing off the stranger seemed to energize Tenchi more than the breakfast had.

---

## SCENE 61: THE HAIR BATTLE
**Time:** 08:08:33 JST  
**Location:** Main house, bathroom

Tenchi's hair resisted organization.

The comb moved through tangled black strands while the boy squirmed on his stool, protests emerging at irregular intervals. "Ow! That hurts! Grandpa, you're pulling!"

"If you held still, the pulling would lessen."

"But it's boring! Why do I have to have neat hair? Who cares what my hair looks like?"

"Mrs. Tanaka cares. And your classmates' parents. And anyone who sees a boy representing the Masaki family."

The argument was familiar. It recurred most mornings. Neither party expected to win; the ritual merely provided structure.

---

## SCENE 62: CLOTHING SELECTION
**Time:** 08:14:22 JST  
**Location:** Main house, Tenchi's room

The kindergarten had no uniform.

Tenchi selected his own clothing—a privilege that Katsuhito had granted early, believing that small choices developed larger decision-making capacities. The results were sometimes alarming.

Today's selection: green shorts, a red shirt with a cartoon train on the front, mismatched socks (one white, one blue).

"The socks—"

"They're lucky socks!" Tenchi's defense was immediate. "I wear different colors on test days and I always do good!"

There were no tests in kindergarten. But the logic was four-year-old logic, and Katsuhito had learned to pick his battles.

"Very well. Lucky socks today."

---

## SCENE 63: DESCENDING TO SHELDON
**Time:** 08:18:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, stairs

The kitchen was spotless.

Katsuhito noted the condition as he and Tenchi descended—every dish dried and stored, counters wiped, table cleared. Sheldon stood by the window, watching the morning light play across the garden.

"Thank you for handling the kitchen."

Sheldon turned. "It was nothing. You've provided so much more."

"Sheldon-san! Look at my socks!" Tenchi thrust his feet forward, displaying the mismatched pair. "They're lucky!"

The young man studied the socks with apparent seriousness. "I can see that. The blue one is definitely luckier than the white one."

Tenchi beamed.

---

## SCENE 64: DEPARTURE PREPARATION
**Time:** 08:22:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, genkan

Three sets of footwear awaited.

Katsuhito's geta. Tenchi's small sneakers. Sheldon's... borrowed sandals, sized slightly too large for him.

"We should address your wardrobe situation," Katsuhito said. "The village general store carries basic clothing. And shoes that fit."

"I would be grateful." Sheldon slid the oversized sandals onto his feet. "Though I'm uncertain how to pay. My resources are... limited."

"We will discuss arrangements. For now, consider any purchases part of your establishment here."

The young man's expression shifted through something that might have been shame. "I will repay you. Somehow."

"Repayment takes many forms."

---

## SCENE 65: THE WALK BEGINS
**Time:** 08:27:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main path

The morning was perfect for walking.

Cool air carried the scent of cedar and moss. Bird calls echoed from the forest canopy. The path wound downward through the shrine grounds, its surface worn smooth by generations of ascending and descending feet.

Tenchi immediately surged ahead. "Catch me, Grandpa!"

Katsuhito maintained his deliberately aged pace. "I'll catch you at the first torii."

"I'll beat you!"

The boy vanished around the path's first turn, his laughter trailing behind.

---

## SCENE 66: WALKING WITH SHELDON
**Time:** 08:31:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, descent path

With Tenchi out of earshot, conversation became possible.

"He has considerable energy," Sheldon observed.

"Children at this age often do. It is both exhausting and sustaining."

"You've raised him well. Despite the obvious difficulties."

Katsuhito glanced at his companion. "Obvious difficulties?"

"The absence of his parents. The remote location. The responsibilities you must carry alone." Sheldon's assessment was clinical but not unkind. "Single grandparent caregiving is challenging in any circumstance."

---

## SCENE 67: SHELDON'S PERCEPTION
**Time:** 08:35:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, lower path

The young man saw clearly.

Katsuhito had presented the situation in broad strokes yesterday—Nobuyuki's work in the city, the loss of Kiyone, the decision to raise Tenchi at the shrine. But Sheldon had evidently extrapolated the implications.

"It is not as difficult as it might appear," Katsuhito said. "Ten-chan is a good child. And the village provides support when needed."

"Still. You carry weight that might be shared."

"Perhaps." The observation struck closer to truth than Katsuhito preferred to acknowledge. "But sharing requires trust. And trust requires time."

"How long does trust take?"

The question landed with unexpected force.

---

## SCENE 68: APPROACHING THE FIRST TORII
**Time:** 08:39:22 JST  
**Location:** First torii, southern approach

Tenchi waited beneath the gate, bouncing with impatience.

"I won! I beat you both!"

"You certainly did." Katsuhito reached the gate and placed his hand on his grandson's head. "Victory through speed."

"Now I get to pick what we do next!"

"That was not the agreement."

"It should be! Winners get to pick!"

Sheldon observed the exchange with the attention of someone taking notes.

---

## SCENE 69: PASSING THROUGH THE WARD
**Time:** 08:42:17 JST  
**Location:** First torii, crossing

The southern ward remained healthy from his morning maintenance.

Katsuhito felt its subtle pulse as they passed through—the spiritual structure that protected the shrine's boundary from casual intrusion. The ward registered Tenchi (familiar, welcome) and Katsuhito (familiar, master) without difficulty.

Sheldon's passage created the same absence he'd noticed during the pre-dawn inspection. The young man moved through warded space without touching it, as if he walked a parallel path that ran alongside but separate from the spiritual structure.

Fascinating.

---

## SCENE 70: THE DESCENT BEGINS
**Time:** 08:45:44 JST  
**Location:** Mountain path, upper section

The path steepened beyond the first torii.

Three hundred twenty steps from shrine to village—Katsuhito had counted them decades ago, during the first years of his tenure. The number had become a kind of meditation. Ascending was prayer. Descending was release. The rhythm of steps marked the boundary between sacred duty and mundane life.

Tenchi skipped down the steps ahead, his young legs unbothered by the incline.

"Be careful on the loose stones," Katsuhito called.

"I know! I always know!"

---

## SCENE 71: OBSERVING SHELDON'S DESCENT
**Time:** 08:49:17 JST  
**Location:** Mountain path, middle section

Sheldon descended with careful attention.

The young man's borrowed sandals provided poor traction on the worn stone steps, forcing a deliberate pace. But beneath the surface caution, Katsuhito detected something else—a body awareness that suggested Sheldon could have moved much faster if his footwear allowed.

"The steps are ancient," Katsuhito offered. "The originals date to the Kamakura period. These are replacements from the Meiji era."

"They're beautiful." Sheldon's appreciation seemed genuine. "The wear patterns alone must tell centuries of stories."

"Stories in stone." Katsuhito had not heard the sentiment expressed quite that way before. "An apt description."

---

## SCENE 72: THE VILLAGE APPEARS
**Time:** 08:55:33 JST  
**Location:** Mountain path, lower section

The tree line opened to reveal the valley below.

Katsuhito always paused at this overlook point, allowing visitors (and himself) a moment to appreciate the view. The village spread across the valley floor—rooftops clustered along the river's course, fields stretching into the distance, the line of the main road cutting through like a scar through green skin.

"It's smaller than I expected," Sheldon said.

"Cities have distorted our sense of scale. This was once a significant settlement. The valley produced rice for three prefectures."

"And now?"

"Now it produces rice for itself. And sends its children to the cities."

---

## SCENE 73: TENCHI'S VILLAGE OBSERVATIONS
**Time:** 08:58:44 JST  
**Location:** Mountain path, lower section

Tenchi had stopped to wait for them.

"That's Tanaka-san's house!" The boy pointed to a rooftop near the village center. "And that's where Yuki-chan lives—she's my friend. And that long building is the school. See it, Sheldon-san?"

"I see it." Sheldon crouched to Tenchi's level, following the boy's pointing finger. "Which building is the kindergarten?"

"The little one next to the big school! It has a playground behind it. There's a sandbox and swings and a climbing thing!"

"A climbing thing?"

"It's tall and you climb it. Grandpa says I can't climb to the top until I'm bigger."

---

## SCENE 74: COMPLETING THE DESCENT
**Time:** 09:04:22 JST  
**Location:** Village edge, path terminus

The mountain path met the village road.

The transition was marked by a small shrine—a hokora that Katsuhito maintained as part of his responsibilities. He bowed slightly to the tiny structure as they passed, a habit that drew Sheldon's attention.

"A boundary marker?"

"Of sorts. This shrine honors the mountain kami. Acknowledging it ensures safe passage."

Sheldon bowed to the hokora as well, the motion unrehearsed but respectful.

---

## SCENE 75: ENTERING THE VILLAGE
**Time:** 09:07:17 JST  
**Location:** Village main road

The village's morning activity was underway.

Farmers heading to fields. Shopkeepers opening their establishments. A cluster of children in school uniforms walking toward the primary school. The sounds of rural morning—bicycle bells, dog barks, the distant rumble of a tractor.

Several villagers noticed their group. Eyes tracked from Katsuhito (familiar) to Tenchi (familiar) to Sheldon (unfamiliar, interesting).

"Good morning, Katsuhito-san!" called a woman from a vegetable stall.

"Good morning, Mrs. Abe." Katsuhito returned the greeting with appropriate warmth. "How is your husband's knee?"

"Better, better. The exercises are helping."

---

## SCENE 76: INTRODUCTIONS ON THE ROAD
**Time:** 09:10:44 JST  
**Location:** Village main road

The Abe woman's curiosity was evident.

Her gaze kept sliding toward Sheldon, the question visible though unspoken. Village etiquette would prevent direct inquiry, but information would circulate regardless of formal introductions.

"This is Tsukino Sheldon," Katsuhito said, addressing the curiosity before it became speculation. "A relative of the Tsukino family, newly arrived to take care of the property."

"Tsukino?" Mrs. Abe's eyes widened. "The house on the hill? It's been empty for so long!"

"Not for much longer." Katsuhito kept his tone light. "Sheldon-kun intends to restore it."

---

## SCENE 77: SHELDON'S GREETING
**Time:** 09:13:22 JST  
**Location:** Village main road, Abe vegetable stall

Sheldon bowed to Mrs. Abe with appropriate formality.

"Hajimemashite. I hope to become a good neighbor."

His Japanese was correct—grammatically sound, pronunciation acceptably clear—but the rhythm still carried traces of foreign origin. The slight awkwardness would mark him as an outsider even without the unfamiliar face.

Mrs. Abe returned the bow. "Welcome, welcome. If you need vegetables, please visit. We have the best daikon in the valley."

"I'll remember that, Mrs. Abe. Thank you."

---

## SCENE 78: TENCHI'S IMPATIENCE
**Time:** 09:16:17 JST  
**Location:** Village main road

"Grandpa! We're going to be late!"

Tenchi's urgent declaration interrupted the social exchange. The boy tugged at Katsuhito's robe, anxiety evident in his expression.

"We have time, Ten-chan."

"But Yuki-chan said she'd show me the caterpillar today! If I'm late, maybe she already showed someone else!"

The crisis of childhood—caterpillar viewing priority.

"We'll walk faster." Katsuhito bid farewell to Mrs. Abe and resumed the journey. "But no running."

---

## SCENE 79: THE SCHOOL APPROACH
**Time:** 09:22:44 JST  
**Location:** Village center, near school

The kindergarten came into view.

A small building beside the primary school—single story, wooden construction, painted a faded yellow that spoke of limited municipal budgets. The playground Tenchi had described was visible behind: swings, sandbox, the "climbing thing" that turned out to be a modest jungle gym.

Children gathered near the entrance. Parents depositing offspring. Teachers greeting arrivals with professional warmth.

"There's Yuki-chan!" Tenchi pointed. "And the caterpillar! I can see the box!"

---

## SCENE 80: KINDERGARTEN ARRIVAL
**Time:** 09:25:17 JST  
**Location:** Kindergarten entrance

The drop-off proceeded with practiced efficiency.

Katsuhito signed the daily attendance sheet while Tenchi located his cubby, stored his bag, and changed into indoor shoes. The routine had been established in the first weeks of the school year; it required minimal supervision now.

Sheldon stood slightly apart, observing the environment with evident interest.

"First time seeing a Japanese kindergarten?" The teacher—Mrs. Yamamoto, a woman of perhaps fifty with kind eyes—approached with curiosity poorly concealed behind professional courtesy.

"Yes," Sheldon acknowledged. "It's... smaller than I expected."

---

## SCENE 81: TEACHER'S ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 09:28:44 JST  
**Location:** Kindergarten entrance

Mrs. Yamamoto's evaluation of Sheldon was subtle but thorough.

Katsuhito watched the teacher take in the young man's appearance—the mismatched clothing, the ill-fitting sandals, the face that clearly didn't belong to the local population. Her expression remained professionally neutral, but questions formed behind her eyes.

"A relative of the Tsukino family," Katsuhito provided. "Recently arrived from America."

"America!" Mrs. Yamamoto's interest sharpened. "How wonderful. The children will want to ask questions."

"Perhaps another day. Sheldon-kun is still getting oriented."

---

## SCENE 82: TENCHI'S FAREWELL
**Time:** 09:31:22 JST  
**Location:** Kindergarten classroom threshold

"Bye, Grandpa! Bye, Sheldon-san!"

Tenchi's farewell came at full volume from inside the classroom, where he had already joined a cluster of children around what appeared to be a terrarium containing the promised caterpillar. His attention had shifted completely to the insect; adults had become irrelevant.

"Have a good day, Ten-chan." Katsuhito waved. "I'll be here at two."

No response. The caterpillar had won.

---

## SCENE 83: DEPARTING THE KINDERGARTEN
**Time:** 09:33:17 JST  
**Location:** Kindergarten exterior

The morning drop-off complete, the return journey could begin.

Katsuhito led Sheldon away from the school, navigating the village streets with the ease of long familiarity. The walk to the Tsukino house would take them through the commercial district—an opportunity for further introductions and information gathering.

"He adapts quickly," Sheldon observed.

"Children often do. The world is still new enough to require constant adaptation. They have not yet learned to resist change."

"When does that learning happen?"

"Gradually. And then all at once."

---

## SCENE 84: THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
**Time:** 09:38:44 JST  
**Location:** Village commercial district

The village's main shopping area consisted of perhaps a dozen establishments.

A general store that sold everything from rice to radios. A butcher who received shipments from the city three times weekly. A pharmacy operated by a man whose grandfather had practiced traditional medicine. The post office, the bank, the small restaurant that served lunch to workers who couldn't go home at midday.

Each building had a history Katsuhito knew intimately. Owners changed. Inventory evolved. But the essential character persisted across generations.

---

## SCENE 85: THE GENERAL STORE VISIT
**Time:** 09:42:17 JST  
**Location:** Sakamoto General Store

"We should address your clothing needs."

Katsuhito directed Sheldon into the general store—Sakamoto's, operated by the same family for four generations. The current proprietor, Sakamoto Hiroshi, looked up from his newspaper as they entered.

"Katsuhito-san! Early visit today. And you've brought a guest?"

"Tsukino Sheldon," Katsuhito performed the introduction. "He needs work clothes. And footwear."

Sakamoto's merchant instincts engaged immediately. "Of course, of course. We have several options. Please, look around."

---

## SCENE 86: FITTING SHELDON
**Time:** 09:48:33 JST  
**Location:** Sakamoto General Store

The selection was limited but functional.

Sheldon examined the available options with methodical attention—cotton work trousers in various sizes, simple shirts, sturdy boots that would survive renovation labor. His fingers tested fabric quality. His eyes evaluated construction.

"These." The young man selected a pair of dark blue trousers. "And this shirt. Two sets, if available."

"The boots?" Sakamoto retrieved three different sizes. "You'll want proper support for the mountain paths."

Sheldon tried each pair, walking the length of the store to test the fit. "These." Size forty-three, brown leather, ankle-high.

---

## SCENE 87: THE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT
**Time:** 09:55:17 JST  
**Location:** Sakamoto General Store

Katsuhito produced currency before Sheldon could object.

"Put this on the shrine's account," he told Sakamoto. "Sheldon-kun will repay as he's able."

The arrangement was not unusual—the village operated on credit systems that had predated modern banking. But Sheldon's expression suggested discomfort with the debt.

"This is too much."

"It is what is needed." Katsuhito's tone invited no argument. "A man cannot work properly without proper tools. Clothing is a tool."

"I will repay you."

"I know."

---

## SCENE 88: DEPARTING THE STORE
**Time:** 09:58:44 JST  
**Location:** Village commercial district

Sheldon emerged from the store properly dressed.

The transformation was notable—the mismatched borrowed clothing replaced by garments that fit, that moved with his body rather than against it. He looked less like a lost traveler and more like someone who belonged here, who had purpose.

"Better," Katsuhito observed.

"Much. Thank you." The gratitude was genuine, weighted with something deeper than mere appreciation for clothing. "For everything."

"We have not yet reached 'everything.' The Tsukino house still awaits."

---

## SCENE 89: THE PATH TO TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 10:02:17 JST  
**Location:** Village eastern edge

The route to the Tsukino property departed from the village's eastern boundary.

A narrower path than the shrine approach—less maintained, the stone steps more worn, the vegetation pressing closer from both sides. The house had been uninhabited for years; the path had received only minimal attention during that time.

"The property is perhaps fifteen minutes from here," Katsuhito explained. "It sits on a separate hill from the shrine, lower in elevation, more accessible to the village."

"Who maintained it while it was empty?"

"The village, minimally. Enough to prevent complete deterioration. Not enough to preserve livability."

---

## SCENE 90: SHELDON'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPERTY
**Time:** 10:05:44 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

"What happened to the previous owner?"

The question was expected. Sheldon was integrating himself into a history; understanding that history was natural.

"Tsukino Etsuko. She was the last resident. A widow, no children. She passed away three years ago at the age of eighty-seven."

"And the property sat empty since then?"

"There were no direct heirs. Distant relatives exist—in America, apparently." Katsuhito allowed the implication to develop. "The village council agreed to maintain minimal stewardship until inheritance could be determined."

---

## SCENE 91: THE INHERITANCE QUESTION
**Time:** 10:08:17 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

Sheldon processed the information with visible thought.

"I am not actually related to the Tsukino family." The admission came quietly, as if testing whether honesty would be met with rejection. "Whatever connection I have... it was created recently. By whatever brought me here."

"I suspected as much." Katsuhito kept his tone neutral. "The documentation matters less than the intention."

"How can you be certain of my intention?"

"I cannot. But I have lived long enough to recognize when someone is seeking rather than taking. You are seeking."

---

## SCENE 92: ARRIVAL AT THE TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 10:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, exterior view

The house emerged from the forest like a memory made solid.

Traditional construction—wooden frame, ceramic tile roof, sliding screens now warped and clouded with neglect. The structure had been beautiful once. The bones of that beauty remained beneath the accumulation of years.

Sheldon stopped at the edge of the clearing, his expression unreadable.

"It needs work."

"Considerable work." Katsuhito stood beside him, studying the house through the young man's eyes. "But the foundation is sound. The frame has survived. What must be rebuilt can be rebuilt."

---

## SCENE 93: SHELDON'S RESPONSE
**Time:** 10:18:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, clearing

"I can do this."

Sheldon's voice carried certainty that had been absent from his earlier speech. Whatever doubt he'd harbored about his situation, about his place here, seemed to diminish in the face of concrete challenge.

"You have experience with renovation?"

"I... don't know." The young man's brow furrowed. "But looking at it, I understand what needs to be done. As if I've done similar work before."

More memory artifacts. Skills without remembered acquisition.

---

## SCENE 94: APPROACHING THE STRUCTURE
**Time:** 10:21:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, front approach

They crossed the clearing together.

The path to the front entrance had overgrown—weeds pushing through the gravel, a small tree sprouting in what had once been a decorative garden. The engawa that wrapped the house's exterior showed visible rot in several sections.

Sheldon's attention moved systematically across the damage. "The engawa will need replacement. The roof..." He paused, studying the roofline. "Water damage, probably. Years of it."

"Correct. The roof was the first failure. Everything else followed."

---

## SCENE 95: ENTERING THE HOUSE
**Time:** 10:25:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, interior entrance

The door resisted opening.

Sheldon applied pressure to the warped frame, working it back and forth until the mechanism released. The interior revealed itself in stages—dim light filtering through paper screens that had yellowed and torn, furniture draped in dust cloths, the smell of decades pressing out to meet them.

"The electricity is disconnected," Katsuhito said. "And the water. Both will require professional attention."

"I expected as much." Sheldon stepped inside, his movements careful, his weight distributed to test the floor's integrity. "The structure feels stable, though."

---

## SCENE 96: EXPLORING THE MAIN ROOM
**Time:** 10:29:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, main living area

The main room had once been the heart of the house.

Tatami mats—ruined now, stained by water intrusion and pest damage. Sliding screens that no longer tracked properly in their grooves. A tokonoma alcove that had held scrolls and flowers, now empty and dust-choked.

Sheldon moved through the space with evident reverence. His hand brushed the alcove's edge. His eyes traced the ceiling beams.

"She lived here alone?"

"For the last fifteen years, yes. Her husband died in 1974. They never had children."

## SCENE 97: SHELDON'S ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 10:33:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, main living area

"The renovation will take months. Possibly a year."

Sheldon's estimate aligned with Katsuhito's own assessment. The house was salvageable but would require sustained effort to make livable.

"You have that time?"

"I have nothing but time." The statement carried weight that extended beyond its surface meaning. "And I'd rather spend it building than waiting."

"Building what?"

The young man turned, meeting Katsuhito's gaze directly. "Whatever comes next."

## SCENE 98: KATSUHITO'S INTERNAL CONSIDERATION
**Time:** 10:36:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, main living area

The answer satisfied without fully illuminating.

Katsuhito studied the young man—this mysterious arrival who cooked like a master, moved like a trained fighter, and looked at an abandoned house as if it were an opportunity rather than a burden.

Whatever Sheldon Tsukino was, he was committed to being here. To building something. To making this valley his home.

The observation could be concerning. It could also be exactly what the village—what Tenchi—needed.

Time would reveal which.

## SCENE 99: CONTINUING THE INSPECTION
**Time:** 10:40:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, kitchen area

They moved into the kitchen.

This space had suffered less damage than the main room—the roof here had held better, protecting the interior from the worst water intrusion. The wood-burning stove remained intact, though clearly non-functional without extensive cleaning.

"Traditional cooking methods," Sheldon observed. "I can work with this."

"Modern appliances can be added. The village has electricity. Running new lines to this property would not be prohibitively expensive."

"Maybe later. I want to understand the house as it was before I change what it could be."

## SCENE 100: THE ASSESSMENT COMPLETE
**Time:** 10:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, exterior

They emerged from the house into mid-morning light.

Sheldon stood on the damaged engawa, surveying the clearing with the expression of someone making plans. His posture had changed during the inspection—less uncertain, more purposeful.

"Thank you for bringing me here."

"You would have found it eventually."

"Yes. But finding it with guidance is different from finding it alone."

The observation held more truth than perhaps either of them intended.
