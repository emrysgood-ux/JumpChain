## The Bad Luck Phenomenon

Seina Yamada possesses the most extreme case of bad luck ever documented. This is NOT merely superstition — it is a measurable probability distortion field.

### How It Manifests
- Accidents constantly happen around him
- Objects fall, break, malfunction in his presence
- Weather turns bad when he's outside
- Vehicles crash, machines fail, structures collapse
- **CRITICAL:** The bad luck affects his SURROUNDINGS, not him directly — he usually survives

### The Hidden Truth
What appears as "bad luck" is actually:
- A probability manipulation field of unknown origin
- Possibly a mutation, possibly something stranger
- The Galaxy Police eventually weaponizes this: Seina as pirate bait
- When Seina is assigned as decoy, pirates ALWAYS appear — and ALWAYS suffer disasters

*📝 Seina's "curse" is actually the galaxy's most effective anti-pirate weapon.*

## Origin and Early Life

Seina was born and raised in the countryside near Okayama — the same region as the Masaki Shrine. His childhood was marked by:
- Constant accidents
- Social isolation (people learned to avoid him)
- Friendship with Kiriko Masaki (one of few willing to stay near him)
- Occasional contact with Tenchi Masaki (neighbor)

### The Kiyone Connection

**CANON:** Kiyone Masaki (Tenchi's mother) drew on Seina's face while he slept — one of her famous pranks. This confirms:
- Seina visited or stayed at the Masaki household as a child
- Kiyone found his bad luck amusing rather than frightening
- The Masaki family accepted him when others didn't

## Galaxy Police Career (GXP Era)

### Recruitment
Seina was accidentally recruited into the Galaxy Police when Amane Kaunaq crashed near his home (his bad luck pulled her ship down). The GP quickly realized his potential:
- His probability field attracts pirates
- Pirates who attack him suffer catastrophic "accidents"
- He's the perfect decoy/bait

### Rise Through Ranks
Despite being recruited as bait, Seina's genuine heroism and the loyalty he inspires led to:
- Rapid promotion
- Command of experimental ship Kamidake
- Marriage into multiple noble houses
- Becoming one of GP's most effective (if unconventional) assets

---

## The Seto Connection

Seto Kamiki Jurai became intensely interested in Seina because:
1. His probability manipulation might have cosmic origins
2. He could be useful against her enemies
3. She enjoys watching chaos unfold
4. He's a perfect target for her matchmaking schemes

Seto arranged several of Seina's marriages and considers him an ongoing "project."

---

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon POV:**
- The name "Seina Yamada" (as a significant character)
- Any reference to probability manipulation as cosmic phenomenon
- Any reference to Galaxy Police interest in him

**What CAN Be Referenced (Phase I):**
- "That unlucky boy from the village" — vague awareness
- Accidents happening near shrine when a certain child visits
- Katsuhito's bemusement at the walking disaster
- "Kiyone used to prank him" — mentioned in past tense

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **Phase I (1989):** Seina is approximately 5 years old and lives nearby. His bad luck occasionally affects the shrine grounds when he visits. Sheldon may encounter him as "that poor accident-prone child."

🔮 **YEAR 13+:** As Seina grows, his probability field strengthens. By his late teens, the Galaxy Police takes notice. His story runs parallel to the main OVA events.

📖 **DYNAMIC WITH SHELDON:** If Sheldon meets child-Seina, he'll likely feel protective of the obviously cursed boy. Sheldon's ordered existence versus Seina's chaos makes for interesting contrast.

📖 **DRAMATIC IRONY:** Readers familiar with GXP know Seina becomes a galactic hero. Sheldon sees only a pitiful child.

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Seina's bad luck is NOT comedy relief — it's a genuine cosmic phenomenon
- He is NOT weak — his survival proves incredible resilience
- The luck affects his SURROUNDINGS, not him — he survives what kills others
- He is NOT stupid — just conditioned to expect the worst

**GXP Timeline Note:**
GXP events occur roughly parallel to OVA events. Seina is recruited into GP around Year 13-14 of this story's timeline.
