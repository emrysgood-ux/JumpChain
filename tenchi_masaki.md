**Paradox:** Nobuyuki married Kiyone—both are Yosho's descendants through different mothers. This makes Tenchi doubly descended from Yosho.

| 1989 (Year 1) | 4-5 | Kindergarten 年中 | Middle year |
| 1991 (Year 3) | 6-7 | Elementary 1 | Primary begins |

### High School Details

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q22

**School Name:** Kurashiki Nishi Kogyo Koko (Kurashiki West High for Technology)
- Technical/vocational high school
- Located in Kurashiki
- Commutable from Masaki area

**Destruction Event:**
The school was destroyed during the Tenchi/Ryoko battle (OVA events):
- No definite plan to rebuild
- Some students moved to other schools
- Others use temporary huts as classrooms

**Tenchi's Response:**

> "He has quit voluntarily. He thought if he goes to school, Aeka and Ryoko would follow him to cause more trouble."

**Key Points:**
- Tenchi VOLUNTARILY dropped out
- His reasoning: Ryoko and Ayeka would follow him
- He wanted to prevent further collateral damage
- This was a conscious, protective decision

## TENCHI'S ROMANTIC PREFERENCES

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q33

### The Official Answer

> "No particular favourite. He is satisfied with current family-like relationship and feels no need yet for any one particular girl."

### What This Means

1. **No Romantic Favorite:** Tenchi does not prefer any one girl over others
2. **Family Satisfaction:** He is content with the "family-like" arrangement
3. **No Urgency:** He "feels no need yet" for romantic commitment
4. **Current Status:** The situation suits him as-is

### Story Implications

This canonical characterization supports the "found family" transformation:
- Tenchi genuinely values family over romance
- He's naturally inclined toward the dynamic Sheldon creates
- The harem-to-family shift aligns with his actual preferences
- He isn't suppressing romantic desires—he genuinely prefers family

---

## CURRENT STATE (April 1989)

### Physical
- Small for his age
- Dark hair, dark eyes
- Energetic, physically active
- Already showing interest in grandfather's "stick exercises"

### Personality
- Curious about everything
- Asks endless questions ("Nande?")
- Trusting of adults
- Misses his mother (died ~1 year ago)
- Loves his grandfather deeply
- Eager for attention and connection

### Daily Life
- Lives at Masaki Shrine with grandfather
- Father Nobuyuki works from home, but emotionally distant
- Plays around shrine grounds
- Listens to grandfather's stories
- Warned about the "demon in the cave"

---

## THE CAVE AND RYOKO

**What Tenchi Knows (Age 4-5):**
- There's a cave he's forbidden to enter
- Grandfather tells stories about a "sleeping demon"
- The cave is behind the shrine, by the lake
- The key is in grandfather's room

**What Will Happen (Year 13):**
- Tenchi will steal the key
- He will enter the cave
- He will accidentally release Ryoko
- Canon events begin

**Yosho's Plan (101 Secrets Q20):**
The stories and warnings are deliberate. Yosho is cultivating Tenchi's curiosity. He WANTS Tenchi to eventually release Ryoko—it's part of her rehabilitation and Tenchi's destiny. Kiyone helped with this cultivation before her death.

---

## COSMIC POTENTIAL

### What He Will Become
- Manifestation of the Chousin experiment
- Capable of generating 10+ Light Hawk Wings
- Transcends even the three goddesses
- God-tier entity by OVA 3

### Current State (1989)
- Completely ordinary child
- No awareness of potential
- No powers manifesting
- Just a boy who lost his mother

---

## RELATIONSHIP WITH SHELDON

### Initial Meeting (Day 1-2)
- Curious about the stranger
- Quick to attach (missing mother figure?)
- Calls him "Sheru-ji" (Uncle Sheldon)

### Development
Sheldon becomes:
- Uncle/father figure
- Cooking teacher
- Story listener
- Emotional anchor

### The Transformation
In canon: Tenchi accumulates a harem of competing women
In this story: Those women arrive to find a family already in place
They become aunts, not rivals

### Why It Works (Canon Support)
Per 101 Secrets Q33, Tenchi is "satisfied with current family-like relationship." Sheldon's presence creates exactly what Tenchi naturally prefers—family, not romantic competition.

---

## VOICE CONSISTENCY

### Speech Patterns (Age 4-5)
- Simple vocabulary
- Many questions ("Nande?" "Doushite?")
- Mixed Japanese (period-appropriate)
- Enthusiastic declarations
- Occasional mispronunciations

### Sample Lines
- "Sheru-ji! Sheru-ji! Look what I found!"
- "Why does Ojii-chan sweep so much?"
- "Can I help with the food?"
- "Tell me the story again!"
- "Is the demon scary?"

### Age Progression Notes
- Year 5-6: More complex sentences
- Year 8-10: Serious questions begin
- Year 12-13: Adolescent awkwardness
- Year 13+: Canon personality emerges

---

## STORY FUNCTION

### What Sheldon's Presence Changes
1. **Emotional Support:** Tenchi has a nurturing figure during formative years
2. **Family Structure:** Not just grandson-of-priest but part of household
3. **Cooking Skills:** Learns from Sheldon (Supreme Chef influence)
4. **Confidence:** More secure in himself by Year 13
5. **The Harem:** Transforms from romantic competition to found family

### What Doesn't Change
- Tenchi releases Ryoko (Year 13)
- Canon characters arrive
- Canon events occur
- Tenchi's ultimate potential
