# CANON MAPPING SESSION: STATUS SUMMARY
## December 29, 2025

---

# WORK COMPLETED THIS SESSION

## Research Phase ✅

| Topic | Status | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Ryoko's astral observation | ✅ VERIFIED | Can observe shrine; watched Sheldon 12 years; Yosho knew |
| Washu's detection abilities | ✅ VERIFIED | Takes immediate interest in anomalies; uses analysis tech |
| Chousin detection limits | ✅ VERIFIED | Cannot categorize entities above them; Cosmos may read as "impossible" |
| Zero infiltration | ✅ VERIFIED | Detected by physical mark; emotions overwrote programming |
| Canon event sequence | ✅ VERIFIED | Episode-by-episode timeline confirmed |

## Decisions Locked ✅

| Decision | Answer | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Ryoko recognizes Sheldon upon release | YES | 12 years of observation |
| First words to Sheldon | "You're still here." | Acknowledges watching |
| Sheldon's role in Kagato arc | Stays on Earth with Sasami | Preserves Tenchi's hero moment |
| Washu investigation timing | Post-Kagato, gradual | Scientific curiosity approach |
| Washu's detection result | "Divine signature, wrong origin" | Cannot categorize Cosmos work |
| Chousin awareness | Develops slowly over years | Not immediate confrontation |
| "Aunt" dynamic establishment | Through existing family framework | Women integrate into structure |
| Shadow Arc placement | Post-Z Arc (Year 17+) | After Chousin revelation |

## Frameworks Created ✅

| Document | Content | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Canon_Probability_Cascade_Analysis.md | Overall mapping framework | Complete |
| Research_Findings_and_Decisions.md | Verified research + locked decisions | Complete |
| Year13_Ryoko_Release_Framework.md | First canon scene detailed | Complete |

# NEXT STEPS

## Immediate (Ready for Draft)

1. **Ryoko Release Scene** — Framework complete; ready to write
   - Cave sequence (Tenchi POV)
   - Attack sequence (Tenchi POV)  
   - Return home (Sheldon POV)
   - "You're still here" moment
   - Morning after

2. **Sheldon's Response** — Need final decision
   - Option A: "I am." (mirrors simplicity)
   - Option D: "Welcome home." (offers belonging)

## Short-Term

3. **Ayeka Arrival Framework** — Build scene beats for:
   - Space battle/crash
   - Discovery of Yosho alive AND partnered
   - Romantic expectation collapse
   - Aunt framework emergence

4. **Kagato Arc Framework** — Build scene beats for:
   - Parallel narratives (Battle on Soja / Protection on Earth)
   - Sheldon-Sasami scenes
   - Washu's first encounter with Sheldon

## Medium-Term

5. **Washu Investigation Arc** — Detailed timeline:
   - Initial sensing
   - First scans
   - Deeper analysis
   - Conclusions
   - Potential confrontation

6. **Dr. Clay/Zero Arc Modifications** — How does stable household affect:
   - Zero's infiltration
   - Detection timing
   - Emotional development
   - Merger resolution

7. **Z Arc Preparation** — Critical questions:
   - Does Z notice Sheldon?
   - Does Sheldon manifest during crisis?
   - Chousin reaction to Cosmos signature
