## KATSUHITO POV — Part 3: Scenes 101-150

**POV:** Masaki Katsuhito (Yosho)  
**Timeline:** 04:58:20 JST — 15:30:00 JST  
**Coverage:** Morning Solitude → Anticipation → Sensing Sheldon's Arrival

---

## SCENE 101
**Time:** 04:58:20 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The residence settled into its daytime quiet.

Without Tenchi's presence, the space organized itself differently—sounds carried further, stillness deepened, the accumulated weight of empty rooms pressed gently against awareness. He moved through this silence with the ease of someone who had lived alone for most of seven centuries.

Solitude was familiar. Company was the exception.

---

## SCENE 102
**Time:** 05:15:42 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, study

He turned to the morning's correspondence.

Letters from the shrine association—administrative matters, upcoming festivals, the bureaucracy that organized even sacred spaces. A notice from the village office. Something from Nobuyuki in Tokyo, addressed in his son-in-law's careful handwriting.

He opened Nobuyuki's letter first.

---

## SCENE 103
**Time:** 05:18:03 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, study

The letter contained the usual contents.

Nobuyuki's work—architecture, buildings, the particular obsession with physical structures that defined his son-in-law's relationship with the world. Questions about Tenchi. Apologies for not visiting more often. The careful dance of a man who loved his son but couldn't seem to live in the same space.

*He's doing well,* he thought. *You could come see for yourself.*

---

## SCENE 104
**Time:** 05:21:24 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, study

He would respond later.

The relationship with Nobuyuki required maintenance—not because either of them doubted its foundation, but because distance created gaps that only deliberate connection could bridge. Phone calls helped. Letters helped more. Visits helped most, but those came rarely since Nobuyuki had moved to the city.

The letter went into the pile of things requiring attention.

---

## SCENE 105
**Time:** 05:24:45 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, study

The other correspondence required less emotional navigation.

Routine matters. Expected communications. The machinery of administration that kept a shrine functioning within the larger systems of Japanese religious organization. He drafted responses with the practiced efficiency of someone who had written thousands of similar letters.

The anomaly continued its approach at the edge of his awareness.

---

## SCENE 106
**Time:** 06:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, maintenance shed

Mid-morning found him in the maintenance shed.

Tools hung in ordered rows—rakes, shovels, pruning shears, the accumulated equipment of grounds-keeping. Each tool had its place, its purpose, its particular role in the ecosystem of maintenance that kept sacred spaces presentable. He selected what he needed for the day's work.

The wisteria needed training. The growth had exceeded its supports.

---

## SCENE 107
**Time:** 06:45:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, wisteria arbor

The vine had grown enthusiastically over the winter.

New shoots reached in directions the arbor couldn't accommodate—lateral extensions seeking light, vertical growth pushing beyond the structure's capacity. Left untended, the vine would eventually damage the wooden frame. Beauty required containment.

He began the patient work of redirection.

---

## SCENE 108
**Time:** 07:00:49 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, wisteria arbor

Hands that could have crushed stone moved gently among the tendrils.

The disconnect between his true capabilities and his daily tasks had long since ceased to feel strange. Power meant nothing without purpose. Strength served little when the work required patience. He was a prince who had become a gardener, and the gardening suited him.

The shoots yielded to guidance. The vine accepted new constraints.

---

## SCENE 109
**Time:** 07:15:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, wisteria arbor

A visitor would arrive in the afternoon.

He'd grown certain of this through the morning—the approaching presence had acquired the particular qualities that marked someone traveling toward a destination rather than passing through. The energy signature carried intent, direction, purpose.

Whoever was coming had chosen this place specifically.

---

## SCENE 110
**Time:** 07:30:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, wisteria arbor

The wisteria work concluded.

He stepped back to evaluate the result—shoots secured, growth redirected, the framework protected for another season. The vine would bloom in late spring, purple cascades that attracted visitors from the wider region. Beauty served its purpose in sacred spaces.

He collected his tools and moved toward the next task.

---

## SCENE 111
**Time:** 08:15:37 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, stone lanterns

The lanterns needed attention twice yearly.

Spring cleaning cleared winter's accumulation—fallen leaves, spider webs, the slow decay of organic matter that gathered in any sheltered space. He worked through each lantern systematically, cloth and brush removing what didn't belong.

The work was meditative. It allowed the mind to wander while the hands stayed occupied.

---

## SCENE 112
**Time:** 08:45:53 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, stone lanterns

His mind wandered toward the approaching presence.

Silver, Funaho had shown him. Silver against the green of the world. The color suggested something, tugged at memories that had accumulated over seven centuries of existence. Silver had meaning in contexts he'd almost forgotten.

The cloth moved across stone. The memory refused to surface fully.

---

## SCENE 113
**Time:** 09:30:09 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

He paused for tea.

The mid-morning break had become habit decades ago—a moment of stillness in the day's work, a chance to observe the grounds from the perspective of a visitor rather than a keeper. The shrine looked well-maintained from this vantage. The morning's work had served its purpose.

The tea had cooled by the time he finished his assessment.

---

## SCENE 114
**Time:** 10:15:25 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, interior

The shrine required dusting.

Even spaces visited only by pilgrims accumulated the particular dust that came from being open to the world—pollen, particulates, the airborne evidence of life proceeding around the sacred space. He moved through the hall with the careful attention the space deserved.

Dust gathered. Cloth collected. The cycle continued.

---

## SCENE 115
**Time:** 11:00:41 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, altar area

The altar gleamed when he finished.

Lacquer reflected light in deep reds and blacks. Metal fittings caught the sun through high windows. The space looked ready to receive whatever the afternoon might bring—pilgrims, tourists, or something else entirely.

He straightened the offering vessels and stepped back.

---

## SCENE 116
**Time:** 11:45:57 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Lunch required minimal preparation.

Rice from breakfast, reheated. Pickled vegetables. Tea. The simple meal of someone who ate alone most days—functional nutrition rather than culinary ambition. Food served its purpose without demanding attention.

He ate while monitoring the approaching presence.

---

## SCENE 117
**Time:** 12:00:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The presence had entered the mountain's broader territory.

Not on the path yet—still somewhere in the lowlands, moving with the speed that suggested vehicle rather than foot. But the direction had become unmistakable. Whatever was coming, it was coming here.

He finished his rice and set aside the bowl.

---

## SCENE 118
**Time:** 12:30:29 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, perimeter walk

He walked the shrine's boundaries.

The circuit followed paths he'd established centuries ago—routes that connected key points in the mountain's energy flow, lines that reinforced the protections he'd woven into this place since his arrival. The walk served practical purpose, but also served to ground him in the territory he'd claimed.

Funaho's warmth accompanied him throughout.

---

## SCENE 119
**Time:** 13:00:45 JST  
**Location:** Near Funaho (the great tree)

He paused beneath the ancient tree.

The bark showed age that predated his arrival—growth rings that counted years stretching back before humans had settled this island. But the age was superficial. The tree's true nature existed outside the limitations of wooden forms. Funaho was ancient in ways Earth couldn't measure.

*The visitor approaches,* he thought toward her.

---

## SCENE 120
**Time:** 13:05:01 JST  
**Location:** Near Funaho

Funaho's response carried complexity.

Not just acknowledgment—anticipation. The tree had been waiting for something, he realized. Waiting longer than he'd understood. Whatever approached this mountain, Funaho recognized it. Had been expecting it.

*How long?* he asked.

The answer came as depth rather than duration. A very long time.

---

## SCENE 121
**Time:** 13:15:17 JST  
**Location:** Near Funaho

He placed his palm against the bark.

The connection deepened—Funaho's roots reaching into dimensions his senses couldn't normally access, drawing information from sources that existed outside ordinary space. The approaching presence clarified in his perception. Human in form. Not human in essence.

Something had reshaped that essence recently. Very recently.

---

## SCENE 122
**Time:** 13:20:33 JST  
**Location:** Near Funaho

The reshaping carried signatures he'd never encountered.

Not Juraian technology—nothing like the engineering his people had developed over millennia. Something older. Something that operated on principles he didn't recognize. Power that predated the galactic civilizations he knew.

*What did this?* he asked the tree.

Funaho showed him an image: a figure in white, standing at the edge of everything.

---

## SCENE 123
**Time:** 13:25:49 JST  
**Location:** Near Funaho

The image carried no features he could resolve.

White against white. Form without detail. Presence without identity. But the scale was unmistakable—whatever had created this approaching being operated at levels that made even Juraian power look provincial.

He withdrew his hand from the bark. His palm tingled with residual sensation.

---

## SCENE 124
**Time:** 13:30:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, walking

He returned to the shrine's central area with his thoughts racing.

The figure Funaho had shown him existed in stories he'd heard as a child—legends that predated Jurai's expansion, myths that the empire's founding had neither confirmed nor denied. Powers that shaped reality rather than merely manipulating it.

If those stories were true, this visitor was significant indeed.

---

## SCENE 125
**Time:** 13:45:21 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, preparation

He prepared the shrine for reception.

Fresh water in the appropriate vessels. Tea supplies arranged for service. The small adjustments that transformed a sacred space into one ready for hospitality. Whatever was coming deserved appropriate welcome.

His hands moved through familiar tasks while his mind grappled with implications.

---

## SCENE 126
**Time:** 14:00:37 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, waiting

The afternoon had reached its warmest point.

Light fell through the hall's windows at angles that would shift as the day progressed, marking time through shadow rather than sound. He sat in formal position, the posture of receiving, and allowed his awareness to expand toward the mountain's edges.

The presence had begun ascending.

---

## SCENE 127
**Time:** 14:15:53 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, waiting

Not ascending the steps—not yet.

But climbing the mountain's roads, moving through the territory that would eventually terminate at this shrine. The vehicle had stopped, he sensed. Foot travel had begun. Someone was walking toward his domain.

He adjusted his position slightly. Waiting required patience. He had patience in abundance.

---

## SCENE 128
**Time:** 14:30:09 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, waiting

The presence carried suffering.

The perception surfaced gradually—the particular weight in the approaching energy that spoke of loss, confusion, displacement. Whatever transformation had occurred, it had come at cost. The being climbing toward him had been unmade and remade, and the process had left marks.

Compassion stirred beneath his curiosity.

---

## SCENE 129
**Time:** 14:45:25 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, waiting

The steps had begun.

He felt each footfall as a pulse in the mountain's awareness—someone climbing the three hundred and twenty stairs, ascending from secular to sacred with the steady pace of someone managing unfamiliar terrain. Not a pilgrim's reverent approach. Not a tourist's casual ascent.

Someone finding their way.

---

## SCENE 130
**Time:** 14:47:41 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, sensing

The presence passed through the first torii.

The boundary registered the crossing—a new energy entering the space that separated ordinary from sacred. Not hostile. Not threatening. But different. Profoundly different from anything that had crossed that threshold in centuries.

He rose from his seated position.

---

## SCENE 131
**Time:** 14:50:57 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, moving to door

The climber was roughly one-third of the way up.

He could track the progress through Funaho's awareness—each step, each pause, each moment of assessment as the visitor evaluated the path ahead. The being moved with physical competence but psychological uncertainty. Capable body, questioning mind.

He slid open the hall's main door.

---

## SCENE 132
**Time:** 14:55:13 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, threshold

The afternoon light spilled into the hall's interior.

He stood at the threshold, looking down across the grounds toward the stairs' upper terminus. The visitor hadn't appeared yet—still climbing, still approaching, still completing the journey from world to shrine.

The mountain held its breath. Or perhaps that was his own breath, held without conscious decision.

---

## SCENE 133
**Time:** 15:00:29 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, walking

He decided to meet the visitor in the grounds rather than from within the hall.

The choice felt right—less formal, more welcoming. Whatever this being had experienced, formality seemed wrong as a first impression. He walked toward the maintenance path that would let him observe the stairs' upper section without being immediately visible.

Hospitality required appropriate staging.

---

## SCENE 134
**Time:** 15:05:45 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, observation point

The climber came into view.

A man—or something wearing a man's form. Tall by Japanese standards. Mixed heritage visible in the features. Dressed in clothing that didn't quite fit this era—subtle anachronisms that most observers would miss but that his trained eye caught immediately.

Young. Lost. Determined.

---

## SCENE 135
**Time:** 15:08:01 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, observation point

The man paused at the top of the steps.

Breathing. Recovering. Looking around at the grounds with the assessment of someone cataloging a new environment. The eyes moved systematically—torii, then hall, then residence, then forest, then back to the center. Processing. Organizing.

A mind that worked analytically. That much was clear.

---

## SCENE 136
**Time:** 15:10:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approaching

He stepped onto the path that would bring him into view.

The performance required now was simple: elderly shrine keeper, slightly surprised by a visitor's arrival, welcoming but not overwhelming. The role he'd played for centuries. The mask that had become a face.

The visitor's eyes found him. The evaluation that followed was thorough.

---

## SCENE 137
**Time:** 15:12:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approach path

They studied each other across the distance.

The visitor's gaze carried intelligence—not just awareness, but active analysis. The eyes moved across his form, registering details, drawing conclusions. A scientist's attention. Someone who looked at the world as data to be processed.

Interesting. A scientist remade by cosmic power.

---

## SCENE 138
**Time:** 15:14:49 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, closing distance

He walked toward the visitor with deliberate calm.

The pace established presence without aggression, welcome without pressure. Each step communicated something—the confidence of ownership, the openness of invitation. Body language served as conversation before words became necessary.

The visitor watched his approach without retreating.

---

## SCENE 139
**Time:** 15:17:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near visitor

At conversational distance, he stopped.

The man's face showed exhaustion barely contained, confusion carefully managed, hope cautiously permitted. The features held Japanese and African heritage in a combination he'd rarely seen in this country. Handsome, he noted. Young by his own standards. Perhaps thirty apparent years.

"Good afternoon," he said in Japanese.

---

## SCENE 140
**Time:** 15:18:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation beginning

The visitor's response came in Japanese that carried Kyoto inflection.

"Good afternoon. I apologize for arriving unannounced."

The language was technically perfect, the accent marking extensive training. But something beneath the fluency suggested the man was processing multiple layers simultaneously—speaking while also assessing, responding while also questioning.

"Visitors are always welcome," he said. "I am Masaki Katsuhito."

---

## SCENE 141
**Time:** 15:19:37 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, introductions

The name clearly registered.

The man's expression shifted slightly—recognition of a name he'd heard before, perhaps from the woman at the bus stop that Funaho had observed. The shrine keeper's name had preceded his arrival.

"Tsukino Sheldon," the visitor said. "Though I believe you already knew that."

---

## SCENE 142
**Time:** 15:20:53 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, assessment

The directness surprised him slightly.

Most visitors maintained polite fiction longer than this—the social protocols that smoothed Japanese interaction, the careful indirection that avoided direct confrontation. This man had dispensed with pretense within minutes.

"I knew someone was coming," he admitted. "I didn't know who."

---

## SCENE 143
**Time:** 15:22:09 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, continuation

"How did you know?"

The question came without accusation—pure curiosity, the inquiry of someone trying to understand phenomena that defied explanation. The scientist's mind at work again, gathering data even when the data made no sense.

"The mountain tells me things sometimes. This morning, it told me to expect a visitor."

---

## SCENE 144
**Time:** 15:23:25 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation deepening

The visitor processed this without visible disbelief.

The acceptance interested him. Most people who heard such statements either dismissed them as metaphor or retreated into skepticism. This man appeared to be filing the information for later analysis, neither accepting nor rejecting until more data accumulated.

"I see," Sheldon said. And perhaps he did, in ways he didn't yet understand.

---

## SCENE 145
**Time:** 15:24:41 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, offering

"You've climbed a long way," he said. "Please, come inside. Tea will help."

The invitation was traditional, expected, appropriate. But beneath the convention, he wanted more time with this visitor. More opportunity to observe, to understand, to determine what the cosmic reshaping had produced.

Sheldon nodded. "Thank you. Tea would be welcome."

---

## SCENE 146
**Time:** 15:25:57 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, walking together

They walked toward the main hall together.

The visitor moved with the particular efficiency of someone whose body had been optimized—no wasted motion, no unnecessary effort. The walk revealed physical capabilities the man probably hadn't yet discovered. The reshaping had been thorough.

"You mentioned the Tsukino name," he said as they walked. "You've returned to claim your inheritance?"

---

## SCENE 147
**Time:** 15:27:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approach to hall

"I'm not certain what I've returned to claim."

The admission carried honesty that earned respect. The visitor could have fabricated certainty, could have performed confidence he didn't feel. Instead, he acknowledged the truth—that he didn't fully understand his own situation.

"Few of us ever are," he replied. "Certainty comes later, if it comes at all."

---

## SCENE 148
**Time:** 15:28:29 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, entrance

They ascended the hall's steps together.

The wooden platform had supported pilgrims for seven centuries—his feet knew every board, every subtle variation in the surface. The visitor's feet found their way without difficulty, the body's competence compensating for the mind's uncertainty.

"Please, sit." He gestured toward the cushions he'd prepared hours ago.

---

## SCENE 149
**Time:** 15:29:45 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, interior

The visitor settled into formal seiza.

The position came naturally, suggesting training in Japanese etiquette that went beyond casual exposure. Someone had prepared this man for life in Japan, whether through education or direct instruction. The reshaping had included cultural competence.

He began preparing tea.

---

## SCENE 150
**Time:** 15:31:01 JST  
**Location:** Main hall, tea preparation

The kettle was already warm—he'd anticipated this moment.

Water at the correct temperature. Leaves measured with practiced precision. The ritual of preparation serving to establish atmosphere, to create space for conversation that might proceed in unexpected directions.

The visitor watched his movements with the attention of someone studying technique.

"You do this very carefully," Sheldon observed.

"All things worth doing deserve care."
