## VITAL STATISTICS

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Birth Year** | Mid-19th century (~1860s-1870s) |
| **Age (1989)** | ~120-130 years (canon: Tennyo says ~120) |
| **Apparent Age** | Mid-to-late 40s (uses disguise technique) |
| **True Appearance** | Late 20s |
| **Height** | Average |
| **Build** | Slim, sedentary profession |
| **Appearance** | Glasses, mild-mannered (disguised form) |

### Disguise & Longevity

Like his father-in-law Yosho, Nobuyuki:
- Uses "unexplained techniques" to appear middle-aged
- True form is youthful (late 20s appearance)
- Only showed true appearance at wedding to Rea
- Does this to avoid suspicion from Earth neighbors

**Lifespan:** Due to diluted Juraian heritage through the Kasumi line, Nobuyuki lives longer than normal humans but has NO body enhancement. His lifespan is estimated at 150-300 years—longer than humans but far shorter than enhanced family members. **Story projects his death at ~Year 45-50.**

## LINEAGE PARADOX

Nobuyuki is descended from Yosho through the Kasumi line (700 years of descendants). He then married Kiyone Masaki, who is Yosho's DAUGHTER through Airi.

```
Yosho ─┬─ Kasumi (~1292)
       │      │
       │      ↓ (700 years of descendants)
       │      │
       │   Nobuyuki
       │      │
       └─ Airi (~1700s)
              │
           Kiyone ────────┘
              │
        ┌─────┴─────┐
        │           │
     Tennyo      Tenchi
```

**Result:** Tenchi is doubly descended from Yosho—through both parents.

## CURRENT SITUATION (1989)

### Work Schedule
| Day | Location |
|-----|----------|
| Monday-Friday | City (architectural firm) |
| Saturday-Sunday | Masaki Shrine |

### Living Arrangement
- Maintains apartment in city for workweek
- Returns to family home on weekends
- Home is partway down the mountain from shrine
- ~500m from shrine, ~300m from Tsukino house

### Emotional State
- Grieving wife's death (~1 year ago)
- Guilt over not being present more
- Relies heavily on Katsuhito for Tenchi's care
- Throws himself into work as coping mechanism
- Genuinely loves Tenchi but doesn't know how to show it

---

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Kind but awkward
- Workaholic (avoidance behavior)
- Mild-mannered, non-confrontational
- Romantic at heart (will develop "pervy" reputation in canon)
- Deeply misses Kiyone

### How He Copes
- Overworks
- Avoids the shrine (too many memories)
- Lets Katsuhito handle parenting
- Brings gifts instead of presence

### With Tenchi
- Loves him deeply
- Doesn't know how to connect
- Feels inadequate as single father
- Relieved Katsuhito is there
- Weekend visits feel awkward, forced

---

## RELATIONSHIP WITH SHELDON

### Initial Reaction
- Confused by stranger at shrine
- Cautiously accepting (Katsuhito vouches)
- Slightly jealous of easy rapport with Tenchi
- Ultimately grateful for additional support

### Development Over Time
- Sees Sheldon filling gaps he can't
- Mixture of relief and guilt
- Comes to genuinely appreciate him
- Eventually: family, not interloper

### Key Dynamic
Nobuyuki provides what Sheldon can't: biological connection, legal authority, financial support. Sheldon provides what Nobuyuki can't: daily presence, emotional availability, domestic stability.

**They complement rather than compete.**

---

## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### What Nobuyuki Knows
- Father-in-law is shrine priest
- Wife came from "unusual family"
- Some family secrets exist (doesn't pry)
- Tenchi is special somehow

### What Nobuyuki Doesn't Know
- Katsuhito is 700-year-old alien prince
- Wife was half-alien
- Tenchi has cosmic potential
- Demon sealed under the shrine
- Anything about Jurai, space, etc.

### His Approach
- Deliberately doesn't ask questions
- Prefers comfortable ignorance
- "If it's important, someone will tell me"
- This changes dramatically in Year 13

---

## CANON TRAJECTORY

### Pre-Canon (Years 1-12)
- Weekend father pattern continues
- Gradually more comfortable with Sheldon
- Still processing grief
- Work remains primary focus

### Canon Era (Year 13+)
- Aliens literally crash into his life
- Can no longer ignore family secrets
- Adapts surprisingly well
- "Pervy dad" persona emerges (coping mechanism?)
- Marries Rea (OVA 4)
- Has son Kenshi

---

## VOICE CONSISTENCY

### Speech Patterns
- Polite, formal Japanese
- Avoids conflict
- Self-deprecating humor
- Trails off when emotional
- "Ah, well, you see..."

### Sample Lines
- "Tenchi, Papa brought you something from the city."
- "I appreciate you looking after things, Masaki-san."
- "Work has been... busy. Very busy."
- "Kiyone would have..." *trails off*
- "You're good with him. Better than I am."

---

## STORY FUNCTION

### What He Represents
- The "normal" world
- Parental guilt and inadequacy
- Grief processing
- Work-life imbalance
- Biological family vs. chosen family

### Contrast with Sheldon
| Nobuyuki | Sheldon |
|----------|---------|
| Biological father | Chosen family |
| Absent weekdays | Present daily |
| Avoids emotion | Processes through action |
| Legal authority | Practical authority |
| Provides money | Provides meals |

### Why This Matters
Sheldon doesn't replace Nobuyuki—he fills the gaps. Tenchi needs both: the father who loves him from afar and the uncle who's there every day.
