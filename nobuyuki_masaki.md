## IDENTITY

| Attribute | Value |

| **Full Name** | Nobuyuki Masaki (柾木 信幸) |

---

## VITAL STATISTICS

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Birth Year** | Mid-19th century (~1860s-1870s) |
| **Age (1989)** | ~120-130 years (canon: Tennyo says ~120) |
| **Apparent Age** | Mid-to-late 40s (uses disguise technique) |
| **True Appearance** | Late 20s |
| **Height** | Average |
| **Build** | Slim, sedentary profession |
| **Appearance** | Glasses, mild-mannered (disguised form) |

### Disguise & Longevity

Like his father-in-law Yosho, Nobuyuki:
- Uses "unexplained techniques" to appear middle-aged
- True form is youthful (late 20s appearance)
- Only showed true appearance at wedding to Rea
- Does this to avoid suspicion from Earth neighbors

**Lifespan:** Due to diluted Juraian heritage through the Kasumi line, Nobuyuki lives longer than normal humans but has NO body enhancement. His lifespan is estimated at 150-300 years—longer than humans but far shorter than enhanced family members. **Story projects his death at ~Year 45-50.**

## LINEAGE AND RESEMBLANCE

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q29

### Why Nobuyuki Resembles Katsuhito

> "Yousho has been on Earth for 700 years since he sealed Ryoko in the shrine. It is not surprising that he had SEVERAL WIVES before and Nobuyuki is a descendant of one of his children by one of these wives. So the similarity is genetic."

**Key Lineage Facts:**
- Nobuyuki is descended from one of Yosho's EARLIER marriages (not necessarily Kasumi)
- Yosho had "several wives" during his 700 years on Earth
- The physical resemblance between Nobuyuki and Katsuhito is GENETIC
- This explains the similarity without coincidence
- Nobuyuki then married Kiyone (Yosho's daughter), creating a double connection

### Lineage Paradox

Nobuyuki is descended from Yosho through the Kasumi line (700 years of descendants). He then married Kiyone Masaki, who is Yosho's DAUGHTER through Airi.

```
Yosho ─┬─ [Several Wives] (~1292+)
       │      │
       │      ↓ (700 years of descendants)
       │      │
       │   Nobuyuki
       │      │
       └─ Airi (~1700s)
              │
           Kiyone ────────┘
              │
        ┌─────┴─────┐
        │           │
     Tennyo      Tenchi
```

**Result:** Tenchi is doubly descended from Yosho—through both parents.

## PROFESSION AND WORK ARRANGEMENT

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q28

### Profession Details
> "What does Tenchi's father Nobuyuki do for a living? He is a designer of ordinary houses. Tenchi's house is one of his works. He owns a small office and has some staff, working as a manager..."

**Key Professional Facts:**
- **Job Title:** Designer/architect of ordinary houses
- **Business:** Owns a small office with staff
- **Role:** Works as manager
- **Notable Work:** Designed and built the Masaki house

### Work Arrangement (1989 - Pre-Canon)

**CRITICAL FOR STORY:** The 101 Secrets Q28 describes his work arrangement BEFORE and AFTER canon events:

**BEFORE Canon (April 1989):**
> "...he originally worked at home in his room..."

- Nobuyuki worked FROM HOME in his own room
- This room later becomes Mihoshi's room (when she arrives)
- He only occasionally went to the office
- This means he was MORE PRESENT at home than post-canon depictions suggest

**AFTER Canon (Post-Ryoko Moving the House):**
> "...but after Ryoko moved the house near Masaki shrine, he works in his office and lives alone in a one-room flat not to disturb Tenchi and the girls..."

- Only AFTER Ryoko relocates the house does he move to the city
- This is a deliberate choice to give Tenchi space
- Lives in one-room flat near his office
- The change happens "not to disturb Tenchi"

### Story Implications for 1989

In April 1989, Nobuyuki's work arrangement means:
- He works primarily FROM HOME, not in the city
- He is more available for scenes than post-canon timeline suggests
- His room (later Mihoshi's room) is his home office
- He is physically present more often, though emotionally distant
- The "absent father in the city" dynamic develops LATER

---

## CURRENT SITUATION (1989)

### Updated Work Schedule

| Day | Location | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Monday-Friday | HOME (mostly) | Works from his room; occasional office visits |
| Saturday-Sunday | Same | More family time available |
| Note | - | This changes dramatically after Ryoko moves house |

### Living Arrangement (Pre-Canon)
- Lives in Masaki House with Tenchi
- Works from home in his room
- Goes to city office occasionally, not primarily
- More present than previously depicted
- Still emotionally struggling with Kiyone's death

### Emotional State
- Grieving wife's death (~1 year ago)
- Guilt over not connecting more despite physical presence
- Relies heavily on Katsuhito for Tenchi's emotional care
- Uses work as coping mechanism even when home
- Genuinely loves Tenchi but doesn't know how to show it

---

## PERSONALITY

### Core Traits
- Kind but awkward
- Workaholic (avoidance behavior)
- Mild-mannered, non-confrontational
- Romantic at heart (will develop "pervy" reputation in canon)
- Deeply misses Kiyone

### How He Copes
- Buries himself in work (even at home)
- Stays in his room/office for long hours
- Lets Katsuhito handle emotional parenting
- Brings gifts instead of presence
- Physically present but emotionally absent

### With Tenchi
- Loves him deeply
- Doesn't know how to connect
- Feels inadequate as single father
- Relieved Katsuhito is there
- Even when home, struggles with direct interaction

---

## RELATIONSHIP WITH SHELDON

### Initial Reaction
- Confused by stranger at shrine
- Cautiously accepting (Katsuhito vouches)
- Slightly jealous of easy rapport with Tenchi
- Ultimately grateful for additional support

### Development Over Time
- Sees Sheldon filling gaps he can't
- Mixture of relief and guilt
- Comes to genuinely appreciate him
- Eventually: family, not interloper

### Key Dynamic
Nobuyuki provides what Sheldon can't: biological connection, legal authority, financial support. Sheldon provides what Nobuyuki can't: daily presence, emotional availability, domestic stability.

**They complement rather than compete.**

---

## KNOWLEDGE STATE

### What Nobuyuki Knows
- Father-in-law is shrine priest
- Wife came from "unusual family"
- Some family secrets exist (doesn't pry)
- Tenchi is special somehow

### What Nobuyuki Doesn't Know
- Katsuhito is 700-year-old alien prince
- Wife was half-alien
- Tenchi has cosmic potential
- Demon sealed under the shrine
- Anything about Jurai, space, etc.

### His Approach
- Deliberately doesn't ask questions
- Prefers comfortable ignorance
- "If it's important, someone will tell me"
- This changes dramatically in Year 13

---

## CANON TRAJECTORY

### Pre-Canon (Years 1-12)
- Work-from-home pattern with Tenchi
- After Year 13, moves primarily to city office
- Gradually more comfortable with Sheldon
- Still processing grief
- Work remains primary focus

### Canon Era (Year 13+)
- Aliens literally crash into his life
- Ryoko moves the house near shrine
- He relocates to city "not to disturb Tenchi"
- Can no longer ignore family secrets
- Adapts surprisingly well
- "Pervy dad" persona emerges (coping mechanism?)
- Marries Rea (OVA 4)
- Has son Kenshi

---

## VOICE CONSISTENCY

### Speech Patterns
- Polite, formal Japanese
- Avoids conflict
- Self-deprecating humor
- Trails off when emotional
- "Ah, well, you see..."

### Sample Lines
- "Tenchi, Papa brought you something from the city."
- "I appreciate you looking after things, Masaki-san."
- "Work has been... busy. Very busy."
- "Kiyone would have..." *trails off*
- "You're good with him. Better than I am."

---

## STORY FUNCTION

### What He Represents
- The "normal" world
- Parental guilt and inadequacy
- Grief processing
- Work-life imbalance
- Biological family vs. chosen family

### Contrast with Sheldon (Revised Understanding)
| Nobuyuki (1989) | Sheldon |
|-----------------|---------|
| Present but distant | Present and engaged |
| Biological father | Chosen family |
| Works from home, unavailable | Available daily |
| Avoids emotion | Processes through action |
| Legal authority | Practical authority |
| Provides money | Provides meals |

### Why This Matters
Sheldon doesn't replace Nobuyuki—he fills the emotional gaps. Even with Nobuyuki physically present, his grief and inability to connect creates space for Sheldon's nurturing role. Tenchi needs both: the father who loves him but can't express it and the uncle who's emotionally there every day.

## MASAKI HOUSE ROOM DESIGNATION

**Per 101 Secrets Q28:**

The room that becomes "Mihoshi's room" in post-canon was originally Nobuyuki's work room/home office. This is where he worked during the 1989 time period.

**Room Evolution:**
1. 1989-2001: Nobuyuki's home office (where he works from home)
2. Post-Mihoshi arrival: Becomes Mihoshi's room
3. Nobuyuki relocates to city apartment
