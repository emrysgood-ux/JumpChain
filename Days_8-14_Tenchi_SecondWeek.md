## **The Garden Helper**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-020 | Before School**
Sheldon-san made something called "omurice." It was eggs but shaped like a pillow with red stuff inside.

"What's the red part?"

"Rice with ketchup and chicken."

"Can I have this every day?"

"We'll see."

"We'll see" usually meant "sometimes." That was okay. Sometimes was better than never.

---

**SCENE 041-080 | Getting Ready**
Tenchi put on his school clothes. They were itchy around the collar but Grandpa said that's how clothes were.

"Have a good day."

Sheldon-san said it from the kitchen. He always said it now. Every morning. Like a promise that the day would be good.

"You too!"

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 161-180 | After School Discovery**
Sheldon-san was in the zen garden. But it looked different. The rocks were in new places. The sand had lines in it.

"Wow."

The man looked up. "What do you think?"

"It's like... like..." Tenchi didn't know the word. "Like water but not water."

"That's exactly what it's supposed to look like."

Tenchi felt smart. He had said the right thing without knowing it was right.

---

**SCENE 181-200 | Learning About Patterns**
"Why does sand need lines?"

"It helps people feel calm."

"Does it work?"

"Try it."

Tenchi looked at the lines. They curved around the rocks like something alive but sleeping. His brain got quiet.

"Oh. It does work."

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 241-270 | Dinner Questions**
"Grandpa, did you ask Sheldon-san to fix the garden?"

"I mentioned it. He exceeded my expectations."

"What's exceeded?"

"Did more than I thought he would."

Tenchi looked at Sheldon-san. The man was eating quietly, not looking at them. His face was a little red.

"You're good at things."

"Thank you, Tenchi."

---

# DAY 9 - APRIL 11, 1989 (TUESDAY)

Sheldon-san showed Tenchi how to use the rake in the zen garden. The rake was too big, so Sheldon-san held it with him.

"Long strokes. Like combing hair."

The sand made shushing sounds. Tenchi liked making the lines. He felt like an artist.

---

# DAY 10 - APRIL 12, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)

Rain again. Tenchi sat with Sheldon-san under the engawa roof.

"Why does it rain so much?"

"The mountains catch clouds. The clouds get heavy and let go."

"Clouds get tired?"

"In a way."

Tenchi understood. He got tired and had to rest too. Clouds were the same.

---

# DAY 11 - APRIL 13, 1989 (THURSDAY)

Sheldon-san made something called "nikujaga." Meat and potatoes in sweet sauce.

"This is what Mama made."

The grown-ups got quiet. Tenchi didn't know why.

"Was it good?" Sheldon-san asked.

"Yours is the same good."

The man smiled, but his eyes looked different. Soft.

---

# DAY 12 - APRIL 14, 1989 (FRIDAY)

After school, Tenchi found Sheldon-san looking at the old house. The one past the shrine.

"What's that house?"

"Your grandfather says it belonged to someone named Tsukino."

"What happened to them?"

"They're not here anymore."

"Did they die?"

"...Yes."

Tenchi knew about dying. Mama died. It meant you couldn't come back.

"That's sad."

"It is."

They stood together looking at the sad empty house. Tenchi held the man's hand. It seemed like the right thing to do.

---

# DAY 13 - APRIL 15, 1989 (SATURDAY)

Weekend! No school!

Tenchi helped Sheldon-san clean the shrine buildings. He got his own small cloth.

"You're very helpful."

"I know."

The man laughed. Tenchi liked making him laugh.

---

# DAY 14 - APRIL 16, 1989 (SUNDAY)

Visitors came. Tenchi stayed out of the way like Grandpa taught him.

After, they ate lunch together. Rice balls and pickles and tea.

"This is my favorite day."

"Sunday?"

"Every day with you and Grandpa."

The man's face did something complicated. Happy and sad together. Tenchi didn't understand it, but he knew he had said something important.
