# CHARACTER PROFILE: NOBUYUKI MASAKI

## VITAL STATISTICS

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Nobuyuki Masaki |
| **Role** | Supporting character (Tenchi's father) |
| **Species** | Human (diluted Juraian descent via Kasumi line) |
| **Gender** | Male |
| **Pronouns** | he/him |
| **Occupation** | Architect (Kurashiki) |

### Birth & Age

| Attribute | Value | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Birth Year | ~1869 (mid-1800s) | **CANON LOCKED** |
| Birth Place | Japan (Masaki lineage) | Canon |
| Chronological Age (1989) | ~120 years | Calculated |
| Apparent Age | ~40s | Due to diluted Juraian heritage |

**CRITICAL CANON NOTE:** Nobuyuki was born in the 19th century, NOT the 20th. His apparent middle age belies his true chronological age of approximately 120 years. This longevity derives from his diluted Juraian heritage through the Kasumi line.

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

|-----------|-------|
| **Height** | ~5'9" |

### Appearance Technique

**CANON NOTE (from userMemories):** Nobuyuki uses an appearance technique similar to but less powerful than Yosho's illusion barrier. He looks mid-40s but his true form appears around 20s. This is NOT a mere illusion—his diluted Juraian heritage allows genuine physical youth maintenance, enhanced by conscious appearance adjustment.

## FAMILY CONNECTIONS

### Immediate Family

| Relation | Name | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Wife | Kiyone Masaki | **DECEASED** (~1986-1987) |
| Son | Tenchi Masaki | Alive, age 4 (turns 5 April 24) |
| Daughter | Tennyo Masaki | Alive, off-world (~80 years old) |
| Father-in-Law | Yosho/Katsuhito | Alive |
| Mother-in-Law | Airi Masaki | Alive, off-world |

### Complex Lineage Note

Nobuyuki's relationship to Yosho is doubly complex:
1. **By Marriage:** Father-in-law (married Yosho's daughter Kiyone)
2. **By Blood:** Distant descendant (through Kasumi line)

This makes Yosho both Nobuyuki's father-in-law AND his ancestor (~600 years removed).

## MARRIAGE TO KIYONE MASAKI

### Courtship History

**Canon Note:** Kiyone "tormented" Nobuyuki for decades before finally marrying him. The nature of this torment is not fully detailed in OVA canon, but suggests:
- A courtship spanning potentially 50+ years
- Kiyone's resistance to commitment
- Nobuyuki's persistent devotion
- Eventually yielding to his dedication

### Children Timeline
