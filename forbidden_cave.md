## Story Beats

**Day 1:** Katsuhito points out the cave, forbids approach. Sheldon accepts.

**Week 2-4:** Sheldon occasionally notices Hikaru avoiding the area. Files it away.

**Year 1-12:** Cave becomes background element. Occasionally remembered, never investigated.

**Year 13:** Tenchi enters cave, removes sword, Ryoko awakens. Everything changes.
