## HOW ABILITIES MANIFEST

### To Sheldon
- Feels like natural talent
- "Grandmama taught me" (domestic skills)
- "I just know" (intuition)
- Doesn't question it much

### To Others
| Observer | Sees |
|----------|------|
| Katsuhito | Remarkably capable |
| Tenchi | Uncle who can do anything |
| Nobuyuki | Impressive domestic skills |
| Washu (Year 13+) | Enhanced by unknown force |

## WHAT HE DOESN'T HAVE

### Cosmos Didn't Grant
| Category | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Combat abilities | Not his role |
| Magic/supernatural attack | Lambda is nurturing |
| Physical enhancement (combat) | Slice-of-life focus |
| Mental domination | Ethical violation |
| Destructive powers | Against Lambda nature |

### The Pattern
Every ability serves **nurturing, creating, caring for others**.
Nothing serves **fighting, destroying, dominating**.

This is deliberate. Cosmos chose a found-family story, not a power fantasy.

## INTERACTION WITH JUMPCHAIN

| Source | Type | Examples |
|--------|------|----------|
| JumpChain | Framework perks | Civilian Savvy, Exceptional Company |
| Celestial Pack | Skill clusters | Supreme Chef, Master Artisan |
| Lambda directly | Passive effects | Infusion, healing presence |

These systems **stack** but don't **merge**. Sheldon is enhanced by multiple sources working in parallel.
