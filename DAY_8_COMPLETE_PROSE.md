## SCENE 1: MONDAY WAKING
**Time:** 05:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The work week rhythm returned.

Sheldon woke before the uguisu, his body having recalibrated after Sunday's rest. The guest room's shadows had become familiar over the three nights he'd slept here—the particular way pre-dawn gray entered through the paper screens, the shapes of minimal furniture emerging from darkness as his eyes adjusted.

Eight days since his arrival. One week plus one day. The counting felt less urgent than it had during those first disorienting hours in the field, but he maintained the habit anyway. Temporal orientation mattered when everything else remained uncertain.

He dressed in work clothes—Nobuyuki's worn garments that had become his uniform—and moved through the morning routine with efficiency born of repetition. Futon folded, face washed, body prepared for the labor ahead.

The shrine residence was already stirring. Water running somewhere suggested Katsuhito had preceded him into wakefulness. Smaller footsteps indicated Tenchi was awake but not yet descended from his room.

Monday. Construction resumed. The week's work awaited.

## SCENE 2: EARLY BREAKFAST
**Time:** 06:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"You're learning to time your mornings," Katsuhito observed.

The priest stood at the stove, preparing rice in the automatic cooker while heating water for tea. His movements carried the same economy Sheldon had observed in every task the man performed—nothing wasted, nothing hurried, everything accomplished with precisely the energy required.

"Yamada expects me at seven. Preparation before labor."

"He mentioned that philosophy. You're absorbing it."

"It makes sense. The hour before work begins determines how the work proceeds."

Katsuhito nodded approval. "That principle extends beyond carpentry. Most endeavors succeed or fail in their preparation."

Tenchi appeared, still rubbing sleep from his eyes, his small body dragging slightly as he navigated toward the table. Monday mornings apparently affected even those who hadn't spent the previous week laboring on roof repairs.

"Kindergarten today," he said, the words carrying neither complaint nor enthusiasm—simple acceptance of the week's structure.

"What will you learn?"

"Counting, probably. And songs. And sharing things." The boy's tone suggested these activities ranked below beetle observation in his personal hierarchy of interests. "I like the counting part."

## SCENE 3: WALK TO THE WORK SITE
**Time:** 06:50:17 JST  
**Location:** Path between Shrine and Tsukino House

The cherry trees had completed their transition.

Where pink and white had dominated a week ago, green now reigned—full spring foliage that would persist through summer before autumn's changes arrived. The blossoms were gone entirely, their petals absorbed into the forest floor, their brief beauty converted to nutrients for future blooms.

Sheldon walked the familiar path, his feet finding the optimal route across the stream stones without conscious direction. Eight days of repetition had encoded the navigation into muscle memory—another small competence added to the growing collection.

The Tsukino house appeared through breaks in the foliage, blue tarps still covering the exposed roof sections. From this distance, the damage remained invisible. Only proximity revealed what a week's investigation had uncovered.

Yamada's truck was already parked near the entrance. The carpenter and his nephew would have arrived at six, begun preparation at six-thirty, and be ready to work by seven. The rhythm was consistent, reliable, the product of decades of professional practice.

*Seven o'clock*, Sheldon reminded himself. *Not a minute later.*

---

## SCENE 4: MORNING BRIEFING
**Time:** 07:05:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

"This week we begin replacement," Yamada announced.

He stood near the ladder, addressing Sheldon and Takeshi with the formality of someone initiating a new phase of work. Behind him, the tarps rippled in the morning breeze—wind from the northeast, cooler than the previous week's southerly flows.

"The damaged members have been identified and documented. Now we remove what cannot be saved and install what will take its place." He produced the notebook that had accumulated their observations. "Six rafters. Three wall plates. Portions of the ridge beam. This is the scope."

"Timeline?" Sheldon asked.

"Two weeks for the structural work, if weather cooperates. Then underlayment, then tiles, then finish work. Eight weeks total, as I estimated." Yamada's voice carried confidence built from experience. "We begin with the rafters. They're the foundation of what follows."

"What do you need from me?"

"Today, you observe. Tomorrow, you assist. The difference matters." He handed Sheldon the notebook. "Document everything. When we remove a member, sketch its condition. When we install a replacement, note the dimensions, the joinery, the treatment applied. This record protects everyone—you, me, the house."

---

## SCENE 5: REMOVAL BEGINS
**Time:** 08:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

Removing a damaged rafter required care.

Yamada explained the process while Takeshi positioned shoring to support the load the member currently carried. Temporary posts, wedged into place with small wooden shims, transferred weight from the compromised rafter to the posts below—posts that rested on foundation stones capable of bearing far more than this fraction of a roof's burden.

"The house doesn't know we're about to change it," Yamada said. "Our job is to make the change invisible to the structure. Support before removal. Replacement before support removal. The house should never feel unsupported."

The metaphor carried weight beyond its literal meaning, but Sheldon filed that observation for later examination.

The first cut came after shoring was complete. A traditional Japanese saw—pulled rather than pushed, the cutting stroke drawing the blade toward the user—bit into wood that had stood for fifty years. The sound was different from what Sheldon expected: softer, almost musical, the teeth finding their path through grain that had hardened with decades of seasoning.

"The wood is old cypress," Yamada observed. "Good material, well-selected, properly dried. Under normal circumstances, it would have lasted another century. But water changes everything."

The cut section came free, revealing the damage hidden within. Where the exterior surface had appeared sound, the interior showed galleries and tunnels carved by termites, channels cut by water traveling paths the builders had never anticipated.

"See here." Yamada pointed to a particularly degraded section. "The water entered through the tile crack, traveled along the grain, pooled at this joint. The standing moisture attracted termites. They followed the moisture deeper, eating as they went. By the time visible damage appeared, the invisible damage had been spreading for years."

---

## SCENE 6: THE REPLACEMENT MEMBER
**Time:** 10:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, ground level

The replacement rafter waited at ground level.

Yamada had sourced it from a timber merchant in the town below—aged cypress, kiln-dried, selected for grain pattern and structural soundness. The piece was longer than needed, requiring cutting to precise dimensions that would match the existing structure.

"Measure twice," Yamada instructed, though the cliché felt different in his delivery—not a platitude but a hard-earned principle. "The old member tells us what the new one must be. But the old member was shaped by hands that aren't ours, using techniques we must infer. Measurement is interpretation, not just calculation."

Sheldon watched Takeshi measure the space where the replacement would fit—not just the length, but the angles at each end, the notches required for joinery, the slight curves that compensated for load deflection over decades of service.

"The original builders adjusted for settling," Yamada explained. "They cut members slightly longer than calculation suggested, knowing the house would compress under its own weight. We must make similar adjustments—not because the new wood will compress, but because the surrounding structure already has."

The mathematics of traditional carpentry, Sheldon realized, weren't simple geometry. They incorporated time, physics, the behavior of materials under stress that accumulated over years rather than moments.

## SCENE 7: LUNCH BREAK
**Time:** 12:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

"You're quiet today," Yamada observed.

They sat on the engawa with their lunch—rice balls, pickled vegetables, tea—looking at the house that was slowly revealing its internal logic.

"Processing," Sheldon said. "There's more complexity than I expected."

"Carpentry?"

"The adjustments for time. The way the original builders anticipated changes that would happen after they were dead."

Yamada nodded slowly. "Traditional construction thinks in generations, not years. The house my grandfather built still stands because he built it for his grandchildren's grandchildren, not for himself." He finished a rice ball, brushed crumbs from his hands. "Modern construction thinks in decades. The buildings going up in Tokyo will be demolished before their first owners' children grow old."

"Is that wrong?"

"Different. Not wrong." The carpenter's voice carried no judgment—only observation. "The old way required skills that took decades to learn and materials that took centuries to grow. The new way trades durability for speed. Both approaches solve problems. They just solve different problems."

Takeshi had finished eating and returned to preparation work, leaving the conversation to the two older men.

"Which approach do you prefer?" Sheldon asked.

"I practice the old way because it's what I know. But my son—" Yamada paused, something shifting in his expression. "My son became an engineer. He builds bridges that will outlast any house I've ever touched. Different scale, different materials, same understanding of what must endure."

---

## SCENE 8: AFTERNOON INSTALLATION
**Time:** 14:00:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

Installing the replacement rafter required precision.

The new member, cut and shaped to match the space it would occupy, had to be lifted into position, aligned with the existing structure, and secured using joinery techniques that predated metal fasteners.

"No nails," Yamada explained as they maneuvered the timber into place. "Traditional joinery uses wood to hold wood. The connections are carved, fitted, locked together by geometry rather than penetration."

The joint he demonstrated was called *okkake daisen tsugi*—a splicing technique that interlocked two pieces of timber through a series of complementary cuts. The complexity of the geometry seemed excessive until Sheldon understood its purpose: the joint was stronger than the wood it connected, distributing stress across multiple surfaces rather than concentrating it at penetration points.

"Metal expands and contracts with temperature," Yamada continued. "Wood expands and contracts with humidity. When you mix metal and wood, their movements conflict. Eventually, the connection loosens." He tapped the newly installed joint with his knuckle—a solid sound, no rattling. "Wood on wood moves together. The connection stays tight for centuries."

"How long to learn this technique?"

"The cuts themselves, a few weeks. The judgment of when and where to apply them, years. The intuition for how the joint will behave over decades of service—" Yamada shrugged. "That comes with time, or it doesn't come at all."

---

## SCENE 9: END OF DAY
**Time:** 17:00:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

One rafter replaced, five remaining.

Yamada reviewed the day's progress as they covered the exposed sections with tarps. The work had proceeded more slowly than Sheldon had anticipated—one member in a full day felt insufficient given the scope of repairs required.

"This pace is normal?" he asked.

"For work that must last, yes. We could move faster using modern methods—metal plates, mechanical fasteners, members cut by machine rather than hand. The house would be repaired in half the time." Yamada secured a tarp corner. "It would also fail in half the time."

"But the cost—"

"The cost is your concern, not mine. I told you my estimate. You accepted." The carpenter's voice carried no defensiveness—only clarity. "If you want faster work, I can recommend contractors who provide it. They're competent. Their methods are sound by modern standards. But their houses will need repair again in twenty years, while mine will last until your grandchildren are old."

The choice, implicitly, had already been made. Sheldon had hired Yamada, not a modern contractor. The pace followed from that decision.

"Tomorrow," Yamada said as they prepared to leave. "Seven o'clock. We continue with the second rafter."

---

## SCENE 10: RETURN TO THE SHRINE
**Time:** 17:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Shrine

The walk back provided space for processing.

One rafter. Eight hours of work, three skilled laborers, countless precise cuts and careful alignments—and the result was a single beam replaced, five more awaiting the same treatment. At this pace, the structural repairs alone would take the two weeks Yamada had estimated, perhaps longer.

*Patience*, Dorothy Mae's voice counseled. *A house built to last deserves to be repaired the same way.*

The wisdom felt abstract against the concrete reality of weeks stretching ahead. Weeks of living at the shrine, weeks of daily labor on a building that couldn't shelter him until the work was complete.

But the alternative—faster repairs that would fail sooner—offered only the illusion of acceleration. He would save weeks now and lose years later.

The shrine's torii gate appeared through the trees. Three hundred twenty steps remained.

He began to climb.

## SCENE 11: EVENING NEWS
**Time:** 18:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

"The council meets Thursday," Katsuhito announced over dinner.

The meal was simple—rice, miso soup, grilled fish, pickled vegetables—but the information landed with weight that had nothing to do with cuisine.

"Village council?"

"The administrative body that manages common resources. Roads, the bathhouse, festival preparations." Katsuhito served rice into Tenchi's bowl. "When someone new moves to the village, the council meets to... consider the addition."

"Consider how?"

"They'll have questions. About your plans, your circumstances, your intentions regarding the Tsukino property." The priest's voice remained neutral, but his eyes conveyed something more. "The village accepts newcomers, but acceptance requires understanding. The council provides that understanding."

"What do I need to do?"

"Attend. Answer honestly. Demonstrate that you intend to be a neighbor, not just an occupant." Katsuhito paused, considering his next words. "The village remembers your family—your grandmother, your great-aunt. That memory works in your favor. But memory alone isn't sufficient. They need to see who you are, not just who you're related to."

Tenchi listened with the attention he gave to adult conversations that might contain interesting information. "Will there be questions about bugs?"

"Probably not," Katsuhito said, his tone softening. "But you never know what a village council might consider relevant."

---

## SCENE 12: COUNCIL PREPARATION
**Time:** 20:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"What questions should I expect?" Sheldon asked.

The evening had cooled enough to require a light jacket. Katsuhito sat in his customary position, tea cup in hand, watching stars emerge through gaps in the cloud cover.

"They'll want to know why you've come. What brought a man from America—" the word carried slight emphasis, acknowledging the strangeness of the circumstance, "—to a small village in the mountains of Okayama."

"My family history brought me."

"That's part of the answer. They'll want the rest." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "Why now? Why this property, which has sat vacant for three years? What are your intentions—will you stay, or will you repair the house and sell it, leaving the village with another empty building?"

"I intend to stay."

"Good. Say that. Say it clearly, without hedging." The priest's voice carried instruction now, not just conversation. "Rural villages have seen too many properties abandoned, too many young people leaving for cities, too many promises that came to nothing. Your commitment must be visible."

"What if I'm not certain? What if I don't know what I'll do in five years, or ten?"

"No one knows what they'll do in five years. But you can know what you intend now, and you can commit to that intention. The village doesn't expect prophecy—it expects good faith."

## SCENE 13: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** ~23:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dreams

The village council met in his dream, but the faces weren't quite human.

Shapes that suggested people, seated in positions of authority, asking questions in languages he couldn't understand. He answered in fragments—Japanese, English, something older that felt like mathematics—and watched their expressions for signs of acceptance or rejection.

*Why are you here?*

*Because I was placed here.*

*By whom?*

*I don't know. Something. Someone.*

The shapes conferred among themselves, their discussion inaudible, their judgment invisible. When they turned back to him, their verdict came without words—acceptance, perhaps, or at least the suspension of rejection pending further evidence.

He woke with the sense of having been evaluated by forces he couldn't identify, for purposes he couldn't understand.
