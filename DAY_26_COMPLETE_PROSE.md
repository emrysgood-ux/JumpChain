# DAY 26 — MOVEMENT BEGINS
## April 28, 1989 (Friday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Shrine (lesson) → Tsukino House (work) → Shrine (dinner)  
**Weather:** Overcast, 19°C high, 12°C low, cool spring day  
**Sunrise:** 5:15 AM | **Sunset:** 6:48 PM

---

## SCENE 1: OVERCAST MORNING
**Time:** 06:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

Clouds had arrived overnight.

The ceiling showed no change, but the quality of light filtering through the window announced the weather's shift. Cooler air, greyer sky, the promise of rain that might or might not arrive. Spring's transition toward rainy season had begun.

Twenty-six days since awakening. Four days remaining in April.

---

## SCENE 2: MORNING PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

Breakfast followed its established routine.

The meal felt different under overcast skies—more intimate somehow, the lack of direct sunlight creating a quality of enclosure that bright days didn't provide. Sheldon ate watching clouds move across the mountain, their shadows creating shifting patterns on the forested slopes.

---

## SCENE 3: FOURTH LESSON
**Time:** 07:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, training ground

Movement began as Katsuhito had promised.

Not dramatic movement—a single step, forward and back, the wooden sword held in the grip Tenchi had spent days learning. The step itself was unremarkable. The instruction surrounding it was not.

"A step is not a step," Katsuhito said. "A step is a decision made by the body, announced to the opponent, committed to without hesitation. Watch."

The priest demonstrated—a single step that somehow communicated intention, confidence, threat. The same physical motion Tenchi had made, yet entirely different in its quality.

---

## SCENE 4: TENCHI'S PRACTICE
**Time:** 08:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, training ground

The boy practiced his step with concentrated determination.

Forward. Pause. Back. The rhythm established itself through repetition, the movement becoming smoother with each iteration. His grip remained correct, his posture maintained the alignment from previous lessons, his bow had preceded the practice without prompting.

"Better," Katsuhito acknowledged. "The body is learning. Let it continue."

---

## SCENE 5: WATCHING THE LESSON
**Time:** 08:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

Sheldon observed the fourth lesson with growing appreciation.

The teaching methodology had revealed its structure—each element building upon previous elements, the sword itself serving as focus point for larger lessons about discipline, attention, commitment. What had appeared to be martial training was something more comprehensive.

*Education disguised as combat*, he thought. *Combat serving as education.*

---

## SCENE 6: BREAKFAST
**Time:** 08:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

Breakfast followed the lesson with comfortable transition.

"Nine days," Tenchi announced. "Until tou-san comes back."

"Your counting continues."

"Counting is easy. Waiting is hard." The distinction arrived with five-year-old wisdom. "I'm good at counting. I'm practicing being good at waiting."

"How do you practice waiting?"

"By doing other things. Lessons and school and playing. When I'm doing other things, I forget I'm waiting. Then when I remember, the number is smaller."

---

## SCENE 7: SCHOOL DEPARTURE
**Time:** 09:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, entrance

Tenchi departed for school with his usual energy partially subdued by the overcast sky.

"Will it rain?" he asked.

"Perhaps. The clouds haven't decided yet."

"I don't like rain. It makes recess inside."

"Inside recess has its own pleasures."

"Not the SAME pleasures." The distinction mattered to a child who valued outdoor activity. "Inside you can't run as fast."

---

## SCENE 8: YAMADA'S ARRIVAL
**Time:** 10:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, entrance

Yamada arrived with Takeshi and supplies for the day's work.

"Rain is possible," the old carpenter observed. "We'll focus on interior finishing today. Exterior work can wait for certain weather."

The decision demonstrated the practical wisdom of experienced craftsmen—adapting to conditions rather than fighting them, selecting tasks appropriate to circumstances.

---

## SCENE 9: INTERIOR WORK
**Time:** 10:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The day's work focused on surface preparation.

Sanding walls for eventual finishing treatment. Checking joints for gaps requiring attention. The kind of detail work that revealed itself only under close inspection but would affect the house's long-term quality.

"A house remembers how it was built," Yamada said. "Every shortcut taken becomes a complaint later. Every care invested becomes silence—the silence of things that don't require repair."

---

## SCENE 10: RAIN ARRIVES
**Time:** 11:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

The rain began as Yamada had anticipated.

Light at first, then steady, the sound on the roof providing accompaniment to interior work. The repairs held—no leaks appeared, no water found its way through the restored structure. The roof work from previous weeks proved its worth.

"Good sound," Takeshi said. "The sound of a house doing what it should do."

---

## SCENE 11: LUNCH
**Time:** 12:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Lunch was consumed under the roof's protection, watching rain fall on the mountain.

"Rainy season approaches," Yamada said. "Another month before it arrives properly, but these early rains announce its coming. The house is ready—the roof will hold."

"You sound certain."

"I am certain. The work we did will last decades if maintained. Certainty in craft comes from knowledge of materials and methods. The rest is weather, and weather we cannot control."

---

## SCENE 12: AFTERNOON CONVERSATION
**Time:** 13:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

Work resumed after lunch, the rain continuing outside.

"The priest," Yamada said during a pause in activity. "You've observed his teaching of the boy."

"I have."

"What do you see in it?"

Sheldon considered before answering. "More than sword training. Discipline, patience, attention. The sword serves as focus for larger lessons."

"Good eyes." Yamada nodded approval. "Katsuhito-san has always taught that way. The surface lesson conceals the deeper one. Not dishonesty—efficiency. Why teach one thing when you can teach many things through the same action?"

---

## SCENE 13: YAMADA'S HISTORY
**Time:** 13:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

"I studied with him briefly," Yamada continued. "Many years ago, when I was young enough to believe sword training would improve my carpentry. It did, but not in the way I expected."

"How did it improve your carpentry?"

"It taught me patience. It taught me that skill comes from repetition, not inspiration. It taught me that the body learns what the mind cannot force." The old carpenter examined a joint before continuing. "Those lessons apply to wood as well as steel."

---

## SCENE 14: WORK CONTINUES
**Time:** 15:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

The afternoon advanced through steady work and steady rain.

The house's interior showed visible progress—surfaces smoother, joints tighter, the accumulated attention of skilled hands transforming rough structure into refined space. Sheldon's contribution remained modest compared to the master carpenters, but his hands grew more capable with each day's practice.

---

## SCENE 15: RAIN STOPS
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

The rain ended as gradually as it had begun.

Clouds remained but had thinned, the late afternoon light finding paths through their coverage. The mountain wore water like decoration—every surface glistening, every leaf holding drops that would fall with the next breeze.

"Tomorrow will be clear," Yamada predicted. "The clouds have exhausted themselves today."

---

## SCENE 16: DEPARTURE
**Time:** 16:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, entrance

The carpenters departed with the usual arrangements.

"Monday we continue," Yamada said. "The weekend will let completed work cure properly. When we return, we begin finishing surfaces—the final stage before the house is complete."

"How long for finishing?"

"Two weeks, perhaps three. Depending on weather and the patience of materials."

---

## SCENE 17: SHRINE VISIT
**Time:** 17:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, entrance

The walk to the shrine carried post-rain freshness.

Every step released fragrance from wet earth, wet leaves, the particular smell of forest after water. The shrine grounds glistened in the emerging sunlight, the day's rain having washed winter's accumulated dust from every surface.

Tenchi met him at the gate with the report of indoor recess.

"We played blocks inside. I built a TOWER."

"How tall?"

"Taller than Yamamoto-kun's tower. He tried to make his taller but it fell down." Satisfaction at competitive victory. "Mine stayed up because I made the bottom bigger."

---

## SCENE 18: DINNER
**Time:** 18:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, dining area

Dinner proceeded with the comfortable rhythm of established routine.

The household had found its three-person pattern—conversations that included everyone, topics that ranged from school to work to the day's weather. The adjustments following Nobuyuki's departure had completed; this was now the normal state.

"The rain tested the roof," Katsuhito observed. "No leaks?"

"None that we found. The repairs held."

"Good. A house that keeps out rain is a house worth inhabiting."

---

## SCENE 19: EVENING
**Time:** 20:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine, engawa

The evening was too wet for comfortable engawa sitting.

Sheldon said his goodbyes earlier than usual, the post-rain chill suggesting an early night. Tenchi had already gone to bed, his energy expended by the day's combination of lessons, school, and indoor play.

"Eight days now," the boy had reported before sleep. "Getting smaller."

---

## SCENE 20: WALK HOME
**Time:** 20:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to Tsukino House

The path home was slick from rain but navigable.

Sheldon walked carefully, the lantern's light reflecting from wet surfaces in unexpected patterns. The forest's sounds had changed with the moisture—different insects, different bird calls, the particular acoustic quality of wet air carrying sound differently than dry.

Twenty-six days complete. Twenty-seven approaching. The count continued.
