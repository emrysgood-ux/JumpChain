# SON OF COSMOS: JUMPCHAIN META-MECHANICS QUICK REFERENCE

**Status:** CANONICAL - ALL DECISIONS LOCKED  
**Document:** JUMPCHAIN_META_MECHANICS_CANONICAL_v1.docx

## SHELDON'S UNIQUE POSITION

Sheldon is **NOT** a standard Jumper:
- Placed by **Cosmos** (mother-son, not patron-client)
- Powers from **Cosmos Seed (Lambda)** + her selections
- **Zero meta-knowledge** of Tenchi Muyo universe
- **Chousin experiment already complete** (outside their frame)
- **Non-Drop-In origin** created real Kiyoshi family

---

## KEY EXISTING PERK: DIMENSIONAL TECHNOLOGY MASTERY

**TMJ Ultimatum (800cp) - DORMANT until Day 366**
- Create sub-dimensional spaces, space-folding tech
- "Vast workings similar to your Warehouse"
- Cannot discover horizontal jumping (universe-to-universe)
- As long as conscious, can open portal to folded spaces

**Critical Implication:** Sheldon CAN create Warehouse-like spaces via this perk

## DECISION QUESTIONS

### Q1: WAREHOUSE EXISTENCE & NATURE

| Option | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **A** | Standard JumpChain Warehouse | |
| **B** | No Warehouse - DTM Only | |
| **C** | Warehouse AS DTM Expression | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **D** | Cosmos-Granted Pocket Space | |

**Recommendation Rationale:** Option C integrates both systems, turns redundancy into narrative payoff, Sheldon builds it using post-Day-366 abilities.

---

### Q2: CONFIGURATION (if exists)

**Access Method:**
- [ ] A. Key Method (standard)
- [ ] B. Portal Method (any surface)
- [ ] C. DTM Natural (no key needed)
- [ ] Key Link Upgrade?

**Extensions/Upgrades:**
- [ ] Workshop Row (scientific labs)
- [ ] Garden (integrate Infinite Meat Garden?)
- [ ] Medical Bay
- [ ] Housing
- [ ] Reality Extruder (manifest as physical location)

**Note:** If Option C, extensions are things Sheldon builds over time (organic growth).

---

### Q3: BODY MOD STATUS

| Option | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **A** | No Separate Body Mod | |
| **B** | Body Mod = Cosmos's Work | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **C** | Separate Body Mod Layer | |

**Recommendation Rationale:** Cosmos's restoration IS his Body Mod. Baseline = "healthy human child with Cosmos Seed" - Lambda IS part of his body.

---

### Q4: COMPANION MECHANICS

| Option | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **A** | No JumpChain Companion Mechanics | **RECOMMENDED** |
| **B** | Cosmos-Designated Companions | |
| **C** | Standard Import at Revelation | |

**Recommendation Rationale:** Tenchi cast should feel like real people first, not "party members." Option B possible for future (post-revelation).

---

### Q5: SYSTEM INTEGRATION

**Key Questions:**
- Can DTM expand/modify standard Warehouse beyond normal limits?
- Can Sheldon create MULTIPLE pocket dimensions?
- Does Lambda Core warmth exist in the Warehouse?
- Does time-stop affect Lambda energy?
- Where does Infinite Meat Garden exist?

**Recommendation:** Lambda always present (part of Sheldon). Celestial Pack items requiring space exist in own sub-dimensional pockets.

---

### Q6: NARRATIVE INTEGRATION

**Discovery Timing:**
- [ ] A. Day 366 Package (all revealed together)
- [ ] B. Gradual Discovery (experimentation)
- [ ] C. Accidental Trigger (crisis)

**Family Reactions to Consider:**
- Washu: Detect anomaly? Scientific interest?
- Katsuhito: Juraian perspective
- Tenchi: Big brother's reaction
- Amya: Mother's concern

**Security:**
- Can Chousin detect dimensional manipulations?
- DTM explicitly says "Cannot run from higher powers forever"

---

### Q7: STORY FUNCTION

**Potential Functions:**
1. Storage (items, souvenirs)
2. Safe Space (emergency refuge)
3. Workshop (scientific projects)
4. Meeting Place (sensitive conversations)
5. Training Ground (dangerous abilities)
6. Garden (Infinite Meat Garden)
7. Archive (knowledge storage)
8. Home (eventual family residence?)

**KEY PRINCIPLE:** Pocket dimension serves **SLICE OF LIFE FIRST** - family dinners, quiet moments, domestic scenes - before Space Opera emergency shelter.

## LOCKED DECISIONS SUMMARY

| Question | Decision | Status |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Q1: Warehouse | **BOTH**: Standard Jumper Warehouse + DTM-created personal space with hidden one-way connection | **LOCKED** |
| Q2: Access | Key for Warehouse (portal upgrade later). DTM-natural for personal space | **LOCKED** |
| Q3: Body Mod | Cosmos's restoration = baseline. Lambda/Cosmos Seed = his SOUL | **LOCKED** |
| Q4: Companions | No mechanics this jump. System exists, not employed | **LOCKED** |
| Q5: Integration | Lambda always present. CP = artificial constraint, not story driver | **LOCKED** |
| Q6: Narrative | Day 366 revelation. Family sees DTM space as lab expansion | **LOCKED** |
| Q7: Function | Slice of Life first. Tech dev, business, home improvement | **LOCKED** |

## DUAL SPACE SYSTEM

### Space 1: Standard Jumper Warehouse
- **Purpose:** Cross-universal storage (fiat-backed items)
- **Contents:** Infinite Meat Garden, Divine Fruit, cross-universal tech
- **Access:** Key (portal upgrade available later)
- **Restriction:** Only Sheldon can access

### Space 2: DTM-Created Personal Dimension
- **Purpose:** Universe-safe workspace
- **Contents:** Labs, tech development, training, family time
- **Access:** DTM-natural (no key)
- **Family Access:** Can be shared (they see it as "his lab expansion")

### Connection
**Hidden one-way link from DTM space to Warehouse** - only Sheldon can see/use
