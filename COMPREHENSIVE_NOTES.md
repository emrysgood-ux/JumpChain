# PART III: KEY SCENES AND CONTENT

## Day 1: The Awakening (April 3, 1989)

### Scene 1.1: The Awakening — Opening (FINAL INTEGRATED VERSION)

**Inventory Checklist:**
- Watch (Seiko, mechanical, brown leather, left wrist, 2:47 PM)
- Handkerchief (white cotton, sharp creases, right front pocket)
- Loose change (left pocket)
- Wallet (brown leather, right rear pocket):
  - Alien Registration Certificate (DOB: March 15, 1959, age 30)
  - Cash: ¥50,000 + smaller denominations (~¥65,000 total)
  - Two bankbooks (regional bank ¥500,000, postal savings ¥297,000)
  - Koseki excerpt (family register)
  - Letter from Uncle Kiyoshi (FULLY READ ON-PAGE)
  - Letter of introduction (formal, with hanko seal)
  - Photograph (elderly man in front of traditional house, worn edges)
  - Property deed (Okayama Prefecture, from Tsukino Michiko)

**Backstory Established via Letter:**
- Mother: Yuki Tsukino (died 1985)
- Father: James Carter (American)
- Employer: Bell Laboratories (on sabbatical)
- California rental property (ongoing income)
- NTT headhunting interest
- Patent portfolio
- Tech company plans
- Previous visits: 1980 (with mother), 1986 (Michiko's funeral)
- Uncle Kiyoshi visit planned: Obon (August) — 4 months away
- Village contacts: Yamamoto Toshiro (roofer), Haruna-san (grocer), Masaki-san (priest)

**Opening Prose (Foundation Version):**
> The first thing Sheldon Carter became aware of was grass.
> 
> It pressed against his left cheek, individual blades cool and slightly damp, their edges soft rather than sharp. The smell of it filled his nostrils with each shallow breath: chlorophyll and wet earth and something indefinably alive, the green scent of growing things that he associated with summer lawns and childhood afternoons in his grandmother's backyard in Georgia.
>
> He did not move.

**Opening Prose (DAY_1_COMPLETE Version):**
> The first thing was light.
>
> Not the harsh fluorescent glare of the laboratory or the cold blue of monitoring screens. This was warm. Diffuse. The kind of light that came through leaves, through sky, through the membrane between sleeping and waking.
>
> I wasn't sleeping.

### Scene 1.3: First Contact — Multi-POV

**Katsuhito POV (from THREE_POV):**
> The old priest had felt him coming for the last twenty minutes.
>
> Not clearly—not the way he could sense Juraian technology or the specific signature of Funaho's imprisoned guest stirring in her sleep. This was subtler. A ripple in the patterns he'd spent seven centuries learning to read.

**Key Katsuhito Observations:**
- Stranger hesitates over his own name (as if learning to wear it)
- Doodles atoms in margins when distracted
- Hums gospel while working without noticing
- Straightens the woodpile unconsciously
- Looks at the lake like he knows something is there
- Causes the shrine grounds to "settle" with his presence

**Tenchi POV (from THREE_POV):**
> Ojii-chan was talking to someone.
>
> Tenchi stopped at the top of the steps, his school bag heavy on his shoulders. He'd run most of the way from the bus stop, like he always did—up all three hundred and twenty steps. He liked counting.
>
> But now he stopped. Because Ojii-chan was standing near the big tree, talking to a man Tenchi had never seen before.
>
> The man was tall. His skin was dark, darker than anyone Tenchi knew. He was looking at Ojii-chan with an expression Tenchi didn't have words for.
>
> Sad, maybe. Or confused.

**Tenchi's Key Recognition:**
- "Chocolate skin"
- Recognizes shared sadness ("sad people hold shoulders like carrying something heavy no one can see")
- Takes stranger's hand
- "Will you still be here tomorrow?"
- Final thought: "He's supposed to be here."

16. 2.16: Night Reflections (21:00-21:30) — Decision to stay

**Day 2 Opening Prose:**
> The darkness held a different quality here.
>
> Sheldon's eyes opened to absolute black—no streetlights bleeding through curtains, no LED displays casting their perpetual glow, no distant highway painting orange across the ceiling. Just darkness, complete and rural, broken only by the thin line of grey where the shutter didn't quite meet the frame.
>
> For three heartbeats, he didn't know where he was.

---

## Day 17: The Kitten (April 19, 1989)

**Key Scene — Pre-dawn with Tenchi:**
> Tenchi sat on his futon, Usagi-chan clutched to his chest, staring at the wall with the intensity of someone willing the sun to rise faster.
>
> "You are awake early."
>
> The boy started slightly, then relaxed. "I couldn't sleep anymore. My brain kept thinking."
>
> "What was it thinking about?"
>
> "Everything. Whether he'll like the mudroom. Whether he'll be scared on the walk here. Whether he'll remember me." Tenchi's voice was small in the pre-dawn darkness. "What if he doesn't remember me?"

**Kitten Name Options Discussed:**
- Hikaru ("light" — because of the dream, everything feels brighter)
- Hinata ("sunny place" — what he is, "my sunny place")

**Kiyone Connection (Yamamoto-san):**
> "Tell him—" Yamamoto-san paused, seeming to weigh her words carefully. "Tell him that Kiyone would be proud. She loved cats. She would be happy to know her son has one of his own."

---

## Day 18: Forest/Cave/Mother (April 20, 1989)

**Emotional Core Scene — Referenced but not fully written in Foundation**

This is identified as one of the Tier 4 (Professional Quality Required) scenes that needs exceptional treatment.

**From Trajectory Map:**
- Scene 18.9: Forest/Cave Revelation (4,000-5,000 words)
- Scene 18.10: Mother Discussion (4,000-5,000 words)

---

## Day 22: Tenchi's 5th Birthday (April 24, 1989)

**Foundation Opening:**
> The morning arrived with the promise of completion.
>
> Sheldon woke before dawn, anticipation drawing him from sleep with the same eagerness that had marked the previous day. Today the mats would be installed, the room would be transformed, the first major milestone of the restoration would be achieved.

**Tier 5 Scenes (Exceptional Quality Required):**
- Scene 22.17: Birthday Dinner (4,500-5,500 words)
- Scene 22.18: Presents Opening (4,500-5,500 words)

---

## Day 28/29: "Home" (April 30 / May 1, 1989)

**Foundation Ending — One Month Reflection:**

**Tenchi's observation:**
> "One month," Tenchi said. "Do you feel different than when you arrived?"

**Sheldon's Response:**
> "Yes," Sheldon admitted. "Though the differences are difficult to articulate precisely. I am more settled than I was. More connected to this place and the people in it. Less uncertain about belonging."

**Tenchi's Insight:**
> "Maybe around the two-week mark. That's when you started seeming more relaxed. At breakfast especially. Before that you always sat very straight, like you were ready to leave quickly if needed."

**Katsuhito's Assessment:**
> "The integration has proceeded well. Better than I anticipated, though I have learned not to make confident predictions about such things."

**Final Prose:**
> One month complete. The foundation laid. The building could begin.

# PART IV: CHARACTER VOICE SAMPLES

## Sheldon Tsukino — The Scientist's Mind

**From DAY_1_COMPLETE (First-Person):**
> The numbers had been in my head—they were always in my head, the curse and gift of a mind that couldn't stop calculating—and the numbers said there was no surviving what was about to happen.

**From Foundation (Third-Person):**
> His grandmother's voice echoed across decades: *The morning finds you where it finds you. What matters is what you do with the hours God gives.*

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Precise, analytical observations
- Georgia childhood references (grandmother, Sunday mornings)
- Scientific framing of emotional experiences
- Formal Japanese speech patterns (Kyoto-trained)
- Internal cataloging of impossibilities

## Katsuhito Masaki — The 700-Year Perspective

**From THREE_POV:**
> Seven centuries of watching humans had given him a sense for damaged souls. This one was damaged. But not, he thought, dangerous.
>
> The tree agreed. Funaho's attention had focused on this newcomer with something that felt almost like recognition.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Patient assessment
- Riddles and teasing humor
- References to long time scales
- Cryptic wisdom statements
- "Cultivated 'old man' mask"

## Tenchi Masaki — The Four-Year-Old's Perception

**From THREE_POV:**
> The man was tall. His skin was dark, darker than anyone Tenchi knew. He was looking at Ojii-chan with an expression Tenchi didn't have words for.
>
> Sad, maybe. Or confused.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Short sentences
- Emotional honesty
- Physical descriptions (chocolate skin, angry fish faces)
- Concrete observations
- "Will you still be here tomorrow?" pattern

## Rea Masaki — The Guardian's Distance

**From DAY_2_COMPILED:**
> "You're awake early, Tsukino-san."
>
> "Habit," he said. "My grandmother believed in early mornings."
>
> Something flickered across her face at that—interest, perhaps, or recognition. "The bathroom is at the end of the hall, on the right. There are towels in the cabinet beside the door." She turned back to her work. "Breakfast will be ready in forty minutes."
>
> It was a dismissal, courteously phrased. She had her routine; he was not yet part of it.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Efficient, practical speech
- Guarded but not hostile
- Protective of household
- Owns the kitchen domain
- Geminar origin (knows she's "different")

# PART VI: FORBIDDEN WORDS AND POV DISCIPLINE

## Forbidden in Sheldon POV (Phase I)

```
Cosmos, Sailor, Sailor Cosmos, Lambda
Jurai, Juraian, Galaxy Police
Ryoko, Washu, Tsunami, Kagato, Ayeka, Sasami
Royal Tree, Phase I/II/III
"remade," "created," "reborn"
```

## Knowledge State Discipline

### What Sheldon KNOWS:
- He died (Alaska, cascade failure, Maria Chen's face)
- His body is different (no scars, younger, restored)
- Documents say he is Tsukino Sheldon
- Japanese language is fluent (surprise to him)
- Family backstory per documents/letter

### What Sheldon DOES NOT KNOW:
- Anything about Tenchi Muyo universe
- Katsuhito's true nature
- What's in the cave
- Why he's here
- Who sent him
- That it's Sailor Cosmos

---

# PART VII: WHAT WORKED VS. WHAT FAILED

## Days 1-3: What Worked

The collaborative scene-by-scene process produced:
- Specific character observations (Katsuhito's pattern recognition applied to THIS PERSON)
- Child's perception rendered authentically (not child-like but child)
- Scientist's voice cataloging impossibility
- Multi-POV revealing different layers of same events
- Dense, grounded prose

## Days 4+: What Failed

Autonomous writing produced:
- Template characters ("wise old man" instead of 700-year being)
- Generic observations replacing specific details
- Density collapse (~14k words/day → ~2k words/day)
- POV violations (knowledge leakage)
- Loss of character voice distinctiveness

---

# PART VIII: SCENE HIERARCHY (Quality Tiers)

## Tier 5 — Exceptional (Must Be Perfect)
- 22.17: Birthday Dinner
- 22.18: Presents Opening
- 29.15: "HOME" Statement

## Tier 4 — Professional (Major Investment)
- 1.1: Awakening in Field (4,000-5,000 words)
- 1.3: First Katsuhito Meeting (4,000-5,000 words)
- 4.11: First Cooking Scene
- 14.6: Nobuyuki Arrives
- 18.9: Forest/Cave Revelation
- 18.10: Mother Discussion
- 27.6: First Shōwa Day Visitors

## Tier 3 — Strong (Solid Execution)
- All Multi-POV scenes
- All "first" scenes (first breakfast, first village visit, etc.)

## Tier 2 — Competent (Standard Quality)
- Daily routine scenes
- Transition scenes

## Tier 1 — Functional (Minimum Viable)
- Brief connecting scenes
- Time-passage markers

---

# PART IX: OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Day 17 "mudroom" reference** — Kitten setup location confirmed
2. **Rea POV** — Include as fourth perspective or keep secondary?
3. **Target density** — Days 1-3 drafts ~19k words vs Foundation ~6.6k. Which model?
4. **Scene count per day** — Registry shows 16-35 scenes/day. Sustainable?
5. **THREE_POV vs. Foundation** — Which baseline for expansion?

---

# PART X: RECOMMENDATIONS

## For Outline Expansion

1. Use THREE_POV as voice model (character-specific observations)
2. Use Foundation as event baseline (what happens when)
3. Use Scene Registries as structural framework
4. Apply MAPVS verification to every scene
5. Maintain forbidden word discipline rigorously

## For Prose Generation

1. Read character profiles before EVERY scene
2. Multi-POV scenes require chronological interleaving
3. End scenes with action, not introspection
4. Check knowledge state before writing dialogue
5. Audit forbidden words before scene closeout
