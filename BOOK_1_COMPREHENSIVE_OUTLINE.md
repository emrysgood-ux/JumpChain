# BOOK 1 OVERVIEW

## Title Structure
**Series:** Son of Cosmos: JumpChain
**Book:** 1 (of projected 10)
**Timespan:** 1989-1992 (Pre-Canon Period, Years 1-3)

## Core Premise
Sheldon Carter, theoretical physicist with four PhDs, dies in a particle accelerator accident at University of Alaska Fairbanks (October 2025) and is resurrected by Sailor Cosmos as her first son. He is placed in the Tenchi Muyo OVA universe in April 1989—twelve years before canon events begin. He arrives with no meta-knowledge of where he is, a reconstructed body reset to age 30, fabricated documentation establishing him as a Japanese-American citizen, and a single directive: "Live well."

## Central Thematic Question
*What does it mean to live well when you've been given a second chance you didn't ask for?*

# UNIVERSE PROFILE

## Source Material Integration

### Primary Universe: Tenchi Muyo! OVA
- **Canon Period:** August 2001 - ongoing
- **Pre-Canon Period:** All events before Ryoko's release
- **Sheldon's Arrival:** 12 years before canon (April 3, 1989)

### Secondary Universe: Sailor Moon (Cosmos Mythology)
- **Relevant Elements:** Sailor Cosmos, Lambda Power, crystal-based magic
- **Integration:** Sheldon is Cosmos's "son"—created/resurrected by her power

|--------|--------|--------|
| Lambda Power | Sailor Cosmos | Sheldon (untrained, instinctive) |
| Light Hawk Wings | Juraian Royal Trees | Not accessible to Sheldon |
| Divine Energy | Choushin (Tsunami/Tokimi/Washu) | Background presence only |

### Timeline Anchors
| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| April 3, 1989 | Sheldon arrives | Story begins |
| April 24, 1984 | Tenchi's birth | Fixed (Tenchi is 4 at story start) |

# PROTAGONIST PROFILE: SHELDON TSUKINO (née CARTER)

## Pre-Resurrection Life (1987-2025)

### Background
- **Birth:** August 21, 1987, Jackson, Mississippi
- **Raised By:** Dorothy Mae Carter (grandmother) after parents proved inadequate

- **Career:** Academic researcher; final position at University of Alaska Fairbanks
- **Death:** October 23, 2025 (age 38)—particle accelerator cascade failure

### Psychological Profile
| Trait | Manifestation |
|-------|--------------|
| Analytical mind | Cannot stop calculating; patterns everything |
| Academic isolation | Deep expertise, shallow connections |
| Grandmother's voice | Internal moral compass; practical wisdom |
| Grief-competent | Lost parents early; knows how to function around absence |
| Workaholic | Used career to avoid emotional engagement |

### Character Core
Dorothy Mae Carter's teachings form Sheldon's moral foundation:
- "The morning finds you where it finds you. What matters is what you do with the hours God gives."
- "A man should always carry a handkerchief."
- "A man who can't take care of his own body can't be trusted to take care of anything else."

## Post-Resurrection State (April 1989-)

### Physical Changes
- **Age Reset:** 30 (from 38 at death)
- **Body Condition:** Peak physical capability; enhanced (but not superhuman) strength/stamina
- **Removed:** All scars, calluses, physical evidence of lived life
- **Added:** Skills and muscle memory for cooking, gardening, other domestic abilities

### Fabricated History
- **Japanese Name:** 月野シェルドン (Tsukino Sheldon)
- **Birth Date (documented):** March 15, 1959
- **Nationality:** American (Japanese permanent resident since 1987)
- **Background Story:** Son of Tsukino Yuki (Japanese) and James Carter (American); raised in California; worked at Bell Laboratories; on sabbatical after mother's death
- **Property:** Inherited house in Kamogata village from great-aunt Michiko

### Knowledge Constraints (CRITICAL)
**Sheldon has NO meta-knowledge of:**
- Tenchi Muyo as a fictional property
- Any character's future
- Ryoko's existence in the cave
- Washu/Tsunami/Tokimi's true nature
- Jurai, the Galaxy Police, or space-faring civilization
- His own origin (Cosmos's son)

**Sheldon DOES know:**
- He died and was brought back
- Something/someone rebuilt his body and created his documentation
- He received a message: "Live well. I will find you when I can."
- He has access to some kind of power (tested once, exhausted himself)
