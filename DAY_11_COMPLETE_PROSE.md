**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Shrine residence → Tsukino House (work site) → Shrine residence → Village Community Center → Shrine residence  
**Weather:** Clear, 20°C high, 12°C low, warm afternoon  
**Sunrise:** 5:40 AM | **Sunset:** 6:33 PM

## SCENE 1: WAKING WITH PURPOSE
**Time:** 05:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The day of evaluation had arrived.

Sheldon woke with the clarity that came from resolved uncertainty—the waiting was over, and whatever would happen would happen today. His body rose from the futon with movements that felt purposeful rather than routine, each action carrying the weight of the evening ahead.

He dressed in work clothes despite knowing he would change later. The morning and afternoon would follow their established pattern: construction site, physical labor, the accumulation of another day's contribution to his house's repair. Only the evening differed. Only the evening mattered in the way that would shape his relationship with this place.

The guest room held him for a moment longer than necessary. He had slept here eleven nights now. Whether he would continue to sleep here depended partly on what happened tonight—not immediately, but eventually. Acceptance meant remaining in the community. Rejection meant... choices he didn't want to make.

---

## SCENE 2: MORNING ROUTINE
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Breakfast preparation followed its pattern.

Thursday wasn't his assigned cooking day, but he helped anyway—washing rice, preparing vegetables, the small contributions that had become expected rather than offered. Katsuhito worked beside him with the silent efficiency of long practice, neither of them acknowledging the evening's significance.

"Eat well today," the priest said finally. "Nerves diminish appetite, but you'll need energy for the meeting."

"I'll try."

"Don't try. Eat." The instruction carried gentle authority. "The council will see your physical state before they hear your words. Exhaustion reads as weakness. Vitality reads as capability. These impressions form faster than people realize."

Sheldon took a larger portion of rice than he might have otherwise.

---

## SCENE 3: TENCHI'S OBSERVATION
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

"You're eating more today," Tenchi observed.

The boy's attention to detail continued to surprise Sheldon. Four years old, yet capable of noticing quantity variations in breakfast portions. The observation suggested an analytical mind developing beneath the childish exterior.

"I'm building strength for tonight."

"For the meeting?"

"Yes."

Tenchi considered this while chewing his fish. "Grandfather says meetings are where adults talk about important things. Is your meeting important?"

"It's important to me."

"Then I hope it goes well." The statement carried the simple sincerity children offered before learning to hedge their wishes. "Grandfather says you belong here. The meeting should just be people agreeing with him."

The child's logic—clear, uncomplicated, resistant to adult ambiguity—offered a kind of comfort.

---

## SCENE 4: WALK TO WORK SITE
**Time:** 07:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between shrine and Tsukino House

The morning carried warmth that promised a pleasant day.

Sheldon walked the familiar path with heightened awareness, noting details he might have missed on ordinary days. The way light filtered through new leaves. The sound of the stream at its crossing point. The particular angle where the Tsukino house first became visible through the trees.

This path connected two versions of himself—the household member he'd become at the shrine and the property owner he would become at the house. Tonight's meeting would determine how the village understood him. Not just the council members, but everyone who would hear about the meeting's outcome.

*Newcomer* or *neighbor*. *Stranger* or *community member*. The distinction mattered in ways that accumulated over years.

---

## SCENE 5: WORK SITE
**Time:** 08:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

Yamada had nearly completed the west side splice.

The joint—three days of patient work—approached the moment of testing. The new tenon would seat into the prepared mortise, gravity and geometry combining to create a connection stronger than the original. The damaged section of ridge beam would become a memory, replaced by wood that would last another fifty years.

"Today we'll set the joint," Yamada announced. "Then move to the east side."

Sheldon watched from his position on the scaffolding. The carpenter's movements carried the confidence of someone who had performed this work hundreds of times, adjusted for conditions that varied with each building, each timber, each specific configuration of damage and repair.

"If the joint is too tight?"

"We'll adjust. Measure twice, cut once—but be prepared to adjust regardless." Yamada positioned the tenon against the mortise opening. "The principle applies to more than carpentry."

---

## SCENE 6: THE JOINT
**Time:** 10:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, ridge beam

The tenon seated with a sound like a door closing.

Yamada had tapped it into place with careful mallet strikes, each blow precisely calibrated to advance the joint without damaging the surrounding wood. The connection tightened incrementally, faces mating until no gap remained visible.

"There." The carpenter ran his hand across the joined surface. "Feel how the grain aligns?"

Sheldon touched the joint where old wood met new. The transition was perceptible but smooth—different textures that had achieved continuity through careful preparation.

"The old builders believed that properly joined wood became one piece again," Yamada said. "Not metaphorically. Actually. The grain would grow together over decades, the connection strengthening as the wood settled."

"Is that true?"

"I've seen hundred-year-old joints that suggest it might be. Whether it's literally true or practically true matters less than the care the belief produces."

---

## SCENE 7: LUNCH
**Time:** 12:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The noon meal felt weighted with anticipation.

Sheldon ate mechanically, his mind already processing the evening ahead. Seven o'clock. Five council members. Questions he couldn't fully predict despite Katsuhito's preparation.

"Stop thinking about it," Takeshi said.

"I can't."

"Then think about it differently. The meeting isn't a test you can fail—it's an introduction you haven't finished." The nephew's perspective differed from both Yamada's practical silence and Katsuhito's philosophical guidance. "They want to know who you are. That's all. Show them, and whatever happens after is their response to reality, not to performance."

"That's reassuring and terrifying at the same time."

"Most truths are."

---

## SCENE 8: AFTERNOON PROGRESS
**Time:** 14:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

Work continued on the east side.

Yamada had begun marking the mortise location, pencil lines appearing on weathered wood with the precision of technical drawing. The east side would take another three days—marking, cutting, preparing, fitting. By then, the ridge beam would be whole again, its structural integrity restored.

Sheldon assisted where he could—holding tools, passing materials, observing techniques he might someday need to apply. The work occupied his hands while his mind wandered to the evening.

"You're distracted," Yamada said without criticism.

"Apologies."

"No apology necessary. Distraction before important events is natural." The carpenter continued marking. "But don't carry distraction into the meeting itself. When you sit before the council, be present with them. They'll know if your mind is elsewhere."

"How do I ensure presence?"

"Listen more than you speak. Watch their faces while they're asking questions. Let each question fully land before beginning your answer." Yamada paused his marking to face Sheldon directly. "The council has seen people who performed answers they'd prepared. Those people rarely convinced anyone. Truth sounds different from preparation."

---

## SCENE 9: EARLY DEPARTURE
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Yamada released him early.

"Go. Prepare. The work will continue tomorrow regardless of how tonight proceeds." The carpenter's voice held something that might have been encouragement. "You've worked well these past weeks. That speaks more clearly than any answer you'll give tonight."

"Thank you, Yamada-san."

"Thank me by continuing to work well. The house deserves proper repair, and proper repair requires workers who return to complete what they've started."

The implicit message wasn't lost on Sheldon—Yamada expected him to return tomorrow, which meant Yamada expected the council meeting to end acceptably. The carpenter's practical assessment carried its own kind of prediction.

---

## SCENE 10: PREPARATION
**Time:** 17:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The formal clothes waited where he'd placed them.

The suit from his awakening—the one he'd worn when dying and been reborn wearing—had been cleaned and pressed at some point during his stay here. He hadn't asked who had done it. The clothes simply appeared, ready, as if the household anticipated needs before he voiced them.

He dressed with attention to details Katsuhito had specified: shirt collar properly arranged, jacket buttons aligned, shoes polished to the degree that suggested care without obsession. The image in the small mirror showed a man dressed for serious business—different from the work clothes he'd worn for weeks, but not foreign.

The physicist had worn clothes like these. The construction worker had worn different clothes. Tonight, both identities would appear before the council.

---

## SCENE 11: FINAL GUIDANCE
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

"Remember what we discussed," Katsuhito said.

The priest had prepared tea but hadn't offered it—the timing would interfere with the tea protocol at the meeting itself. Instead, they sat in the main room, Sheldon dressed formally while Katsuhito remained in his daily clothes.

"Arrive at 6:55. Accept the seat they offer—it will be facing the council. Accept tea when offered. Wait for questions."

"And if they ask about my past?"

"Answer truthfully within the bounds of what can be understood. Your American upbringing, your Japanese mother, your education, your reasons for coming to Japan." Katsuhito's gaze held his steadily. "The parts of your history that defy explanation need not be offered. Truth is not the same as completeness."

"That feels like deception."

"It feels like wisdom. No one shares their complete self with strangers. The council seeks relevant truth, not exhaustive biography. Give them what they need to understand you—no more, no less."

---

## SCENE 12: THE WALK
**Time:** 18:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to village

The evening light cast long shadows across the mountain.

Sheldon walked the path toward the village with measured pace—not so fast as to arrive early, not so slow as to appear reluctant. The 320 steps descended behind him, each one marking distance from the shrine's protection and proximity to the community's evaluation.

The community center sat in the village's lower district, near the agricultural cooperative and the elementary school. He'd passed it during village errands but never entered. Tonight he would enter as a subject of discussion, an object of assessment, a person whose belonging required formal acknowledgment.

His feet found the path automatically. His mind rehearsed nothing—Katsuhito's advice about presence over preparation had landed. Whatever questions came, he would answer them as himself rather than as a performance of what he thought they wanted.

The community center appeared ahead, its lights visible through the gathering dusk.

---

## SCENE 13: ARRIVAL
**Time:** 18:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, entrance

The building was older than he'd expected.

Wooden construction, traditional style, the kind of structure that had served its community for generations. A small sign beside the door announced "Village Council Meeting" in characters he could read but not have written.

He removed his shoes at the entrance, placing them in the rack with the same care he'd learned for entering homes. The interior revealed itself in stages: a genkan leading to a hallway, the hallway leading to a larger room where light spilled through a partially open fusuma.

Voices emerged from the room—adult conversation, measured and purposeful. The council was already present.

He approached the door at precisely 6:55.

---

## SCENE 14: THE COUNCIL
**Time:** 18:55:22 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

Five faces turned toward him as he entered.

The room was arranged traditionally: a low table running the room's length, zabuton cushions positioned for seating, the council members arrayed along one side with a single cushion opposite—his seat. A tea service waited on the table, cups already arranged.

"Please, enter. Be seated." The speaker was an older man Sheldon identified as Yamamoto Goro, the senior farmer Katsuhito had described. His face held the weathered quality of someone who had spent decades working outdoors.

Sheldon moved to the indicated cushion and sat in seiza, the formal posture that his body had learned somewhere he couldn't remember. The position placed him facing all five council members—evaluated by their collective attention.

"Tea?" A woman's voice—Tanaka Michiko, the merchant's wife. She gestured toward the service.

"Please. Thank you."

The tea was poured and accepted with the silent ritual he'd observed at the shrine. The cup's warmth grounded him in the present moment.

---

## SCENE 15: FIRST QUESTION
**Time:** 19:02:00 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

Yamamoto Goro spoke first, as seniority dictated.

"You are Tsukino Sheldon. You claim inheritance of the Tsukino property on the mountain. Tell us why you've come."

The question was broader than expected—not specific queries about documents or timeline, but an invitation to explain himself comprehensively.

"I came because this is where my family is from." Sheldon heard his voice emerge steadier than he felt. "My grandmother was born in this village. Her sister—my great-aunt Etsuko—lived in the house I've inherited until her death. I grew up hearing about this place, about the mountain, about the family that had lived here for generations."

"You grew up in America."

"I did. My mother married an American. I was raised speaking English, living American life. But she told me about Japan, about her childhood here, about the family she'd left behind."

Yamamoto nodded slowly, his expression unchanged. "Many people have stories about distant homes. Few act on them. Why did you?"

"Because the inheritance arrived when I needed direction. Because the house needed someone. Because—" He paused, searching for honest words. "Because I wanted to belong somewhere that my family had belonged. America was where I lived. This is where my people are from."

---

## SCENE 16: TANAKA MICHIKO'S QUESTIONS
**Time:** 19:10:33 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

The merchant's wife leaned forward slightly.

"The practical matters concern me. How will you support yourself? The Tsukino property has agricultural potential, but farming requires years of learning. Do you have savings? Skills that produce income?"

"I have savings—enough for the house repairs and several years of modest living." Sheldon met her gaze directly. "I was a scientist before coming here. That career won't continue in this village—I understand that. But I've learned quickly during my time here. Construction work. Household tasks. Whatever skills this community needs, I'm willing to develop."

"Scientists don't usually become farmers or carpenters."

"Scientists observe, experiment, and adapt. Farming and carpentry follow similar principles—learning the environment, understanding how systems work, adjusting approaches based on results. The subject matter differs, but the method translates."

Tanaka Michiko's expression suggested she was reserving judgment rather than rejecting the answer.

---

## SCENE 17: KOBAYASHI HANAE'S PERSPECTIVE
**Time:** 19:18:00 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

The retired schoolteacher's voice carried the careful diction of someone who had spent decades choosing words precisely.

"I knew your great-aunt. Etsuko-san was a woman of strong opinions and stronger commitments. She maintained that house alone for forty years after her husband died—repaired what needed repair, grew what needed growing, participated in community life without complaint or request for help."

"I've heard she was remarkable."

"She was stubborn." Kobayashi's correction carried no criticism. "Stubbornness can be virtue or flaw depending on its direction. Etsuko-san's stubbornness was directed toward preservation—of the house, of the family name, of standards she refused to lower."

"I hope to honor that legacy."

"Hope is intention without action. What actions have you taken?"

"I've worked on the house repairs every day since the damage was discovered. I've learned from Yamada-san the proper methods for traditional construction. I've followed the customs of the community as Katsuhito-sama has taught them." Sheldon paused. "And I've begun to care about this place—not as inheritance, but as home."

---

## SCENE 18: SUZUKI TARO'S CONCERNS
**Time:** 19:25:17 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

The post office director reviewed papers before him.

"The documentation appears in order. Passport, residence registration, property deed, banking records. All consistent with your stated identity and intentions." His voice held the neutrality of someone who dealt in facts rather than impressions. "My question concerns duration. Many foreigners—forgive the term—arrive with plans that change. The property becomes investment rather than residence. The house is sold or left vacant. The community gains nothing."

"I don't plan to sell."

"Plans change. What prevents yours from changing?"

Sheldon considered the question carefully. "Nothing prevents plans from changing. I can't guarantee what I'll want in ten years—no one can. But I can tell you what I want now: to finish repairing that house, to live in it, to participate in this community as my great-aunt did. If those intentions change, I'll be honest about the change. But I don't expect them to."

"Expectation isn't commitment."

"Then accept my commitment: I will not sell the property or leave it vacant without first discussing my intentions with this council. If circumstances force me to leave, I'll find a use for the house that serves the community—rental, sale to a committed resident, something that doesn't add another empty building to the mountain."

---

## SCENE 19: MORI YOSHIO'S OBSERVATION
**Time:** 19:32:44 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

The neighborhood association head had remained silent until now.

His face showed the patience of someone who preferred observation to speech—a quality Sheldon recognized from his own professional training. The man had been watching how the other council members reacted, gathering information before forming conclusions.

"I've heard reports about you," Mori said finally. "From people who've seen you in the village, at the construction site, in the store. They describe someone who works without complaint, who follows instructions, who asks questions when uncertain rather than proceeding in ignorance."

"I try to learn properly."

"You also helped Sato-san's grandson last week. The boy fell near the shrine and scraped his knee. You cleaned the wound and walked him home."

Sheldon remembered the incident—a minor event he hadn't thought worth mentioning. "He was hurt. It seemed like the obvious thing to do."

"Obvious things aren't always done. Some people would have told the boy to find his own way home. Some would have ignored him entirely." Mori's voice carried weight that transcended the simple observation. "The small courtesies reveal character more than the large declarations. You've shown that you notice people who need help and act accordingly."

---

## SCENE 20: DELIBERATION
**Time:** 19:40:00 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

"We'll discuss among ourselves," Yamamoto announced. "Please wait in the hallway."

Sheldon rose, bowed, and exited through the door he'd entered. The hallway felt emptier than before—the building's other occupants had departed, leaving only the council and the subject of their discussion.

He stood by the window, watching darkness settle over the village. Lights appeared in distant houses, families concluding their days while he waited for five strangers to determine his community standing.

The meeting had lasted forty-five minutes. Each question had been answered honestly—not completely, as Katsuhito had advised, but truthfully within the bounds of what could be understood. The council had seen his preparation, his nervousness, his commitment expressed in words that might or might not convince.

He had done what he could. The outcome was no longer in his control.

---

## SCENE 21: THE VERDICT
**Time:** 19:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, meeting room

The door slid open.

"Please return," Tanaka Michiko's voice called.

Sheldon re-entered the room and resumed his position on the zabuton. The council members' faces showed nothing he could interpret—professional neutrality maintained until the formal announcement.

Yamamoto Goro spoke.

"The council has discussed your presence, your intentions, and your demonstrated commitment to this community. We have heard testimony from Katsuhito-sama regarding your conduct during your stay at the shrine. We have observed your work ethic through the accounts of Yamada-san and others who have watched you labor."

A pause. Sheldon's heart maintained its rhythm despite his mind's urging toward panic.

"Our assessment is favorable. You are welcomed as a community member, subject to continued demonstration of the qualities you have shown. Your property registration will be processed without objection. Your participation in community affairs is expected and invited."

The words landed with weight that took a moment to register.

Acceptance.

"The welcome comes with expectations," Yamamoto continued. "Participate in community events. Maintain your property to standards. Contribute where your skills allow. Should you fail to meet these expectations, reassessment will follow. But we do not expect failure. We expect the continuation of what we have already seen."

"Thank you." Sheldon's voice emerged quieter than intended. "I will honor this welcome."

---

## SCENE 22: DEPARTURE
**Time:** 20:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Village Community Center, exterior

The night air carried the coolness of spring evening.

Sheldon stood outside the community center, processing what had occurred. The council had accepted him—not enthusiastically, not without reservation, but genuinely. His presence in this village was no longer tolerated; it was welcomed.

The 320 steps waited ahead, climbing toward the shrine where Katsuhito and Tenchi would be waiting for news. The walk would take fifteen minutes at normal pace—time enough to let the verdict settle into something he could report without excessive emotion.

He had come to this village eleven days ago with nothing but the identity he'd been given and the property he'd inherited. Now he had something more: community recognition, formal acceptance, the beginning of belonging that could grow over years into genuine connection.

The first step began the climb home.

---

## SCENE 23: RETURN
**Time:** 20:35:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Katsuhito was waiting.

The priest sat on the engawa in his customary position, tea cup in hand, posture suggesting he had been there for some time. His face remained neutral as Sheldon approached, offering no indication of expected outcome.

"Well?"

"They accepted me." The words emerged with more relief than Sheldon had anticipated. "Favorable assessment. Community membership. Expectations of continued participation."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "As I expected."

"You were confident?"

"I was certain. The council evaluates patterns, not presentations. Your pattern was clear from the first day—someone who works, who learns, who cares about doing things properly. They would have to ignore substantial evidence to reach a different conclusion."

"Thank you. For the preparation. For everything."

"Gratitude is appreciated but unnecessary. You prepared yourself through eleven days of appropriate conduct. I merely helped you articulate what you had already demonstrated."

---

## SCENE 24: TENCHI'S RESPONSE
**Time:** 20:50:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The boy had stayed awake past his bedtime.

Tenchi sat at the low table, clearly fighting sleep, waiting for news that mattered to the household even if its significance exceeded his understanding.

"Sheldon-san is staying," Katsuhito announced.

"I knew he would." Tenchi's voice carried the drowsy certainty of a child who hadn't seriously considered alternatives. "He belongs here. I said so."

"You did."

"Can I go to sleep now?"

"You should have gone to sleep an hour ago."

Tenchi nodded and rose, his small body moving toward his room with the unsteady grace of exhaustion. At the door, he paused.

"Goodnight, Sheldon-san. Welcome to the village."

The greeting—offered by a four-year-old with the sincerity of someone stating obvious truth—carried more weight than the council's formal acceptance.

---

## SCENE 25: NIGHT
**Time:** 22:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Sleep came easily for the first time in days.

Sheldon lay on the futon that had become familiar over eleven nights, his body finally releasing tension it had carried since learning about the council meeting. The evaluation was complete. The verdict was favorable. Tomorrow would arrive with one less uncertainty.

The presence at the edge of his awareness stirred briefly—warmth rather than visibility, approval rather than instruction. Whatever force had placed him here seemed satisfied with the evening's outcome.

*You did well today.*

The words—if they were words—dissolved before he could examine them. Sleep took him into depths that offered no dreams, only the rest that eleven days of accumulated effort had earned.

Tomorrow the construction would continue. The house would progress toward completion. And he would work as a welcomed community member rather than an evaluated stranger.

The transition felt significant in ways he couldn't fully articulate.
