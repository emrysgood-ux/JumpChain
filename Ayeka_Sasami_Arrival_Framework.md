# SECTION 2: WHAT CHANGES (DECISIONS)

## Change Assessment Framework

| Element | Canon | Our Story | Reason |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Ayeka's mission** | Find Yosho, marry him | Same | Her motivation unchanged |
| **Sasami stowaway** | Yes | Yes | Canon preserved |
| **Ryoko confrontation** | Intense rivalry | Same intensity, different absorption | Rivalry is character-driven |
| **Space battle** | Happens | HAPPENS (no change) | Canon event |
| **Yosho revelation** | Discovers he's alive | Discovers he's alive AND partnered | Additional information |
| **Household integration** | Chaotic | More structured | Sheldon provides framework |

---

## LOCKED DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Space Battle Unchanged

**Rationale:**
- Ayeka's arrival is triggered by detecting Ryoko
- Her hatred of Ryoko predates our story by 700 years
- Battle is character-driven, not circumstance-driven
- Sheldon cannot prevent galactic-scale conflict

**LOCKED:** Ryu-Oh vs. Ryo-Ohki battle happens exactly as canon.

---

### Decision 2: Sheldon Witnesses Space Battle

**Rationale:**
- Battle visible from Earth
- Sheldon would be at shrine during evening
- Opportunity for his reaction to cosmic-scale events
- Sets up his integration with arriving characters

**LOCKED:** Sheldon sees battle, crash-landing.

---

### Decision 3: Ayeka Learns About Yosho + Sheldon Together

**Rationale:**
- Ayeka's primary goal is finding Yosho
- Learning he's alive is major revelation
- Learning he's partnered with a man is ADDITIONAL revelation
- Must process both pieces of information

**Order of Revelation:**
1. Ayeka learns Yosho is alive
2. Ayeka meets "Katsuhito" (doesn't recognize transformed Yosho)
3. Ayeka eventually learns Katsuhito = Yosho (standard revelation)
4. Ayeka processes that Yosho has been living with Sheldon for 12 years
5. Understands marriage was never going to happen

**LOCKED:** Ayeka's revelation includes Sheldon's relationship with Yosho.

---

### Decision 4: Ayeka's Initial Reaction is Confusion, Not Anger

**Rationale:**
- Canon Ayeka is initially confused when meeting "Katsuhito"
- She doesn't recognize Yosho due to his aged appearance (illusory)
- The relationship revelation comes AFTER identity confirmation
- Her processing is sequential, not simultaneous

**Emotional Sequence:**
1. Hope (Yosho might be here)
2. Confusion (Who is this old man?)
3. Shock (This IS Yosho?)
4. Additional shock (He has a... partner?)
5. Grief (My engagement was meaningless)
6. Eventually: Acceptance

**LOCKED:** Ayeka processes revelation in stages, not explosive reaction.

---

### Decision 5: Sasami Bonds with Both Tenchi AND Sheldon

**Rationale:**
- Canon: Sasami bonds quickly with Tenchi
- Our story: Additional adult figure available
- Sasami is cooking-oriented in canon
- Sheldon is the family cook
- Natural cooking partnership forms

**Integration Path:**
- Sasami helps with household cooking (canon)
- Sheldon welcomes cooking companion
- Mentor-student dynamic around food
- Becomes "Uncle Sheldon" and "Aunt Sasami" mirroring

**LOCKED:** Sasami-Sheldon cooking partnership established.

---

### Decision 6: Aunt Dynamic Seeds Planted Early

**Rationale:**
- Ayeka and Sasami are Yosho's half-sisters
- They are literally Tenchi's great-aunts
- Sheldon treats them as family, not romantic rivals
- This framing influences household dynamic

**How Dynamic Establishes:**
- Sheldon refers to them by appropriate titles
- Models family relationship rather than harem competition
- Ayeka initially resists ("I am a PRINCESS")
- Eventually accepts family role as more dignified than rivalry

**LOCKED:** "Aunt" framing introduced through Sheldon's modeling.
