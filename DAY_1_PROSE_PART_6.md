# SON OF COSMOS — DAY 1 PROSE
## April 3, 1989 (Monday)
### Part 6: Scenes 251-299

**POV:** Sheldon (exclusive)  
**Timeline:** 16:40:42 JST — 22:30:00 JST  
**Coverage:** House Exploration → Return to Shrine → Dinner → Bath → First Night

---

## SCENE 251
**Time:** 16:40:59 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, main room

He explored the house systematically.

Main room first—the space where life would center. Six tatami mats, slightly worn at their edges but recently replaced in the middle of the floor. Katsuhito's work, presumably. Preparing for an arrival he'd somehow anticipated.

---

## SCENE 252
**Time:** 16:42:16 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, kitchen

The kitchen occupied the house's northeast corner.

Small gas stove, two burners. Sink with a single tap. Shelves holding basic supplies—rice in a lidded container, salt, oil, dried goods whose labels he read without recognition. A window above the sink overlooked the garden.

Functional. Sparse. Adequate.

---

## SCENE 253
**Time:** 16:44:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, bedroom

The bedroom held only a futon closet.

He slid it open to find bedding rolled and stacked—futon, blanket, pillow. Clean, aired recently if the lack of musty smell was any indication. Someone had prepared this house for occupation in the days before his arrival.

---

## SCENE 254
**Time:** 16:46:50 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, bathroom

The bathroom was traditional.

Deep ofuro tub, wooden, designed for soaking rather than washing. The washing area sat separate—stool, bucket, showerhead connected to the wall. The arrangement assumed a particular order: wash outside, soak inside.

He tested the taps. Water ran, cold at first, then warming.

---

## SCENE 255
**Time:** 16:49:07 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, returning to main room

He circled back to the main room and sat.

The house was his now. Four rooms—main, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom—containing the infrastructure of a life. Not luxurious, not uncomfortable. A place where someone could exist.

Where he could exist.

---

## SCENE 256
**Time:** 16:51:24 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, sitting with thoughts

He pulled the letter from his wallet.

The envelope still sealed, his name written in that trembling brushwork. Uncle Kiyoshi, the woman at the bus stop had called the man in the photograph. Yuki-san's brother. His uncle, in this constructed genealogy.

He broke the seal.

---

## SCENE 257
**Time:** 16:53:41 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, reading letter

The letter was short.

*Sheldon—*

*By the time you read this, I will have passed. The house is yours. Yuki would have wanted you to have a place to return to. The shrine priest, Masaki-san, knows you're coming. Trust him.*

*The mountain chooses its own people. You were chosen before you were born.*

*Your uncle,*
*Kiyoshi*

---

## SCENE 258
**Time:** 16:55:58 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, processing letter

The mountain chooses its own people.

The phrase echoed what Katsuhito had said. What Yamamoto Haruko had implied. A shared belief, apparently, among those who lived in this place. The mountain as actor. As entity. As something that selected residents rather than merely tolerating them.

He didn't believe it. He couldn't dismiss it either.

---

## SCENE 259
**Time:** 16:58:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, checking time

His watch showed nearly five o'clock.

The hour Katsuhito had allocated was passing. He should return to the shrine soon, honor the invitation to dinner. The house would wait. It had waited this long.

---

## SCENE 260
**Time:** 17:00:32 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, preparing to leave

He tucked the letter back in his wallet, alongside the other documents that defined his new existence.

The wallet went in his pocket. His shoes waited in the genkan. The house settled into the silence of his departure, patient as it had been for years.

---

## SCENE 261
**Time:** 17:02:49 JST  
**Location:** Path back to shrine

The forest path was darker now.

The sun had dropped below the tree line, leaving the woods in gray-green shadow. His eyes adjusted quickly—the restored vision processing low light without difficulty.

The shrine waited fifteen minutes ahead. He walked without hurry.

---

## SCENE 262
**Time:** 17:15:06 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, returning

The shrine grounds glowed with paper lanterns.

Someone—Tenchi, probably—had lit them in his absence. The warm light transformed the cleared space, softening the traditional buildings into something between sacred and domestic.

---

## SCENE 263
**Time:** 17:15:23 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approaching residence

Tenchi spotted him first.

The boy appeared at the residence door, silhouetted against interior light, then launched himself across the stones with the velocity of children everywhere.

"You came back!"

"I said I would."

---

## SCENE 264
**Time:** 17:15:40 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, with Tenchi

Tenchi grabbed his hand without hesitation.

The gesture startled him—the easy intimacy of childhood, the assumption that physical contact was permitted. Small fingers wrapped around three of his, tugging him toward the residence.

"Ojii-chan made dinner. Come on."

---

## SCENE 265
**Time:** 17:15:57 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

The residence smelled of cooking.

Rice steam, fish grilling, something vegetable beneath. The particular warmth of a kitchen in use, heat and scent combining into the promise of a meal.

Katsuhito appeared in an interior doorway. "Welcome back, Tsukino-san. I hope the house suited you."

---

## SCENE 266
**Time:** 17:16:14 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

"It's... exactly what I needed." The words felt inadequate but accurate.

Katsuhito's smile suggested understanding beyond the statement. "Good. Please, come in. Tenchi has been watching the clock for the past twenty minutes."

"I have not," Tenchi protested. "Only fifteen minutes."

---

## SCENE 267
**Time:** 17:17:31 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The kitchen was larger than he'd expected.

Domestic space rather than shrine facility—a table for three, gas stove with multiple burners, the accumulated equipment of years of feeding a family. Tenchi released his hand and climbed onto a cushion at the table.

"Can I help with anything?" he asked.

---

## SCENE 268
**Time:** 17:18:48 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"The rice needs attention." Katsuhito gestured to the cooker. "You know how to serve?"

He did. The task was familiar, comforting in its mundanity. He found the paddle, the bowls, began transferring rice with the particular scooping motion Dorothy Mae had taught him thirty years and a lifetime ago.

---

## SCENE 269
**Time:** 17:22:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

They assembled the meal together.

Katsuhito handled the fish—saba, salt-grilled, the skin crisped and blistered. He served rice into three bowls. Tenchi, assigned the simple task of placing chopsticks, took the responsibility with visible seriousness.

The rhythm felt natural. As if they'd done this before.

---

## SCENE 270
**Time:** 17:26:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

The table was set.

Rice in lacquered bowls. Miso soup steaming in wooden cups. The grilled mackerel arranged on a serving plate. Side dishes—pickled daikon, spinach with sesame, something he didn't recognize but smelled of ginger.

"Itadakimasu," they said together, Tenchi's voice slightly ahead of the adults.

---

## SCENE 271
**Time:** 17:27:39 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

The first bite of rice was revelation.

Not the rice itself—simple short-grain, properly cooked—but his perception of it. Each grain distinct on his tongue. The subtle sweetness registering as if for the first time. His restored senses transforming ordinary food into something extraordinary.

---

## SCENE 272
**Time:** 17:30:56 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

Tenchi ate with the focused attention of childhood.

No conversation during the meal—a rule enforced through habit rather than statement. The only sounds were chopsticks against ceramic, the soft click of bowls being set down, the occasional satisfied exhale.

He followed the rhythm. His body was hungry, though he hadn't noticed until food appeared.

---

## SCENE 273
**Time:** 17:35:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

The fish was perfectly prepared.

Salt-crusted skin giving way to tender flesh, the particular richness of mackerel balanced by the mineral cure. He ate methodically, separating meat from bone with the precision his grandmother had demanded.

*A gentleman does not struggle with his food.*

---

## SCENE 274
**Time:** 17:40:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

Katsuhito broke the eating silence as the meal wound down.

"The house. Did you find everything in order?"

"Yes. Someone had prepared it recently."

"The village women. They cleaned last week when I told them you were coming."

---

## SCENE 275
**Time:** 17:43:47 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

"How did you know when I would arrive?"

Katsuhito's smile returned. "The mountain speaks in its own time. I knew someone was coming. The specifics... those reveal themselves."

He wanted to press for clearer answers. But Tenchi was listening, and some questions belonged to conversations without children present.

---

## SCENE 276
**Time:** 17:48:04 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

Tenchi finished first, as children do.

"Can I have more rice?"

"Small portion only," Katsuhito said. "It's late."

The boy accepted the portion without argument, returning to his meal with the same focused attention. Whatever dynamic governed this household, it included discipline without resentment.

---

## SCENE 277
**Time:** 17:52:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining table

The meal concluded naturally.

"Gochisousama deshita." The formal phrase of completion, acknowledging the effort behind the food.

Tenchi echoed it, then immediately asked: "Can I show Sheldon-san my room?"

The request used his name directly—progress, perhaps, from "the stranger" to "Sheldon-san" in the course of a single afternoon.

---

## SCENE 278
**Time:** 17:53:38 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, hallway

Katsuhito nodded permission.

Tenchi led the way through the residence—past the kitchen, down a short hallway, to a sliding door decorated with a child's drawings taped haphazardly to the frame.

"This is my room. I drew those. The dragon is best."

---

## SCENE 279
**Time:** 17:55:55 JST  
**Location:** Tenchi's room

The room was small but immaculate.

Futon rolled against one wall. A low desk with school supplies arranged with surprising precision. Shelves holding books, toys, the carefully organized collection of a boy who had been taught to care for his possessions.

The dragon drawing was, objectively, quite good for a four-year-old.

---

## SCENE 280
**Time:** 17:58:12 JST  
**Location:** Tenchi's room

"This is my bug collection." Tenchi pointed to a series of small boxes on the shelf. "Empty now because it's spring. In summer I'll have beetles again."

"You'll show me when you catch them?"

"Yes." The promise was solemn. Binding.

---

## SCENE 281
**Time:** 18:02:29 JST  
**Location:** Returning to main room

They returned to find Katsuhito washing dishes.

"I'll help," he offered, moving toward the sink.

The old man stepped aside without argument. "Tenchi should begin preparing for bed. Tomorrow is a school day."

"But I want to stay up—"

"Tomorrow is a school day," Katsuhito repeated gently.

---

## SCENE 282
**Time:** 18:05:46 JST  
**Location:** Kitchen, washing dishes

He washed. Katsuhito dried.

The domestic rhythm continued—hot water, soap, the particular satisfaction of cleaning what had been used. His hands worked automatically while his mind processed the day's accumulated strangeness.

"You have questions," Katsuhito said quietly.

---

## SCENE 283
**Time:** 18:09:03 JST  
**Location:** Kitchen, washing dishes

"Many."

"Some will answer themselves with time. Others you may ask, though I may not have answers."

"The mountain. The tree. You speak of them as if they're alive."

"Because they are." Said simply, without drama. "In ways that matter."

---

## SCENE 284
**Time:** 18:12:20 JST  
**Location:** Kitchen, washing dishes

He set a clean bowl on the drying rack.

"I don't understand what's happened to me. Why I'm here. What any of this means."

"Neither do I, entirely." Katsuhito's voice remained calm. "But you're here. You're alive. You're welcome. Perhaps meaning follows presence rather than preceding it."

---

## SCENE 285
**Time:** 18:15:37 JST  
**Location:** Kitchen, washing dishes

The philosophical statement should have frustrated him.

He was a scientist. He wanted mechanisms, explanations, replicable results. Not riddles about mountains that spoke and trees that watched and meaning that followed rather than preceded.

But something in Katsuhito's tone suggested patience rather than evasion.

---

## SCENE 286
**Time:** 18:18:54 JST  
**Location:** Kitchen, finishing dishes

The last dish was clean.

He dried his hands on the towel Katsuhito offered, the domestic task complete. Through the wall, he could hear Tenchi preparing for bed—teeth brushing, the particular sounds of a child's nighttime routine.

"You should take a bath before you return to the house," Katsuhito suggested. "The water is already heated."

---

## SCENE 287
**Time:** 18:22:11 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

The bathroom was larger than his house's.

Same traditional arrangement—washing area separate from soaking tub—but scaled for shared use. The water in the ofuro steamed gently, heated by the gas system that served the residence.

He understood the etiquette: guest bathed first, before family.

---

## SCENE 288
**Time:** 18:24:28 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

He undressed methodically.

Shirt, slacks, undershirt, socks—each item folded and placed in the basket provided. Standing naked in the bathroom, he confronted his body directly for the first time.

The mirror showed him: medium brown skin, lean muscle, unmarked perfection. A body that had never known damage.

---

## SCENE 289
**Time:** 18:26:45 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

His eyes in the mirror were brown.

But something in them caught the light strangely—a flicker, almost silver, at the edges of the iris. He leaned closer, trying to identify the anomaly.

It vanished when he looked directly at it. Present only in peripheral vision.

He filed it away. Another data point for later analysis.

---

## SCENE 290
**Time:** 18:29:02 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

He washed thoroughly.

Stool, bucket, soap. The ritual of cleaning before entering shared water—removing the day's accumulation of sweat and dust and the residue of a life that had ended and begun again.

The water ran clear when he rinsed. He was clean.

---

## SCENE 291
**Time:** 18:32:19 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

The ofuro water was hot.

He lowered himself slowly, inch by inch, letting his body adjust to the temperature. The heat penetrated deep—into muscle, into bone, into places he hadn't known were cold until warmth reached them.

---

## SCENE 292
**Time:** 18:38:36 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

He soaked in silence.

The day's tension released in stages—the confusion of waking, the journey, the meetings, the revelations. The water held him, supported him, allowed him to simply exist without purpose for the first time since opening his eyes in that field.

He had survived his first day.

---

## SCENE 293
**Time:** 18:45:53 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

He emerged before the water cooled.

Clean clothes had appeared outside the bathroom door—traditional sleeping yukata, the kind provided for guests. Someone, presumably Katsuhito, had anticipated his needs.

He dressed in the soft cotton and felt more human than he had since dying.

---

## SCENE 294
**Time:** 18:50:10 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Tenchi was already asleep.

Katsuhito confirmed this with a quiet gesture toward the boy's room. "He tried to stay awake to say goodnight. Sleep won."

"Thank you. For everything today."

"This shrine helps those who need help. You needed help."

---

## SCENE 295
**Time:** 18:53:27 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

A lantern was provided for his walk home.

Paper and bamboo, traditional design, a small candle within. The kind of light that had guided travelers through these woods for centuries.

"Come for breakfast," Katsuhito said. "Seven o'clock. We'll begin finding your place here."

---

## SCENE 296
**Time:** 18:56:44 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house, night

The forest at night was different.

Darker, obviously, but also fuller—alive with sounds the daylight hours suppressed. Insects, distant owls, the rustling of small creatures moving through underbrush.

The lantern cast a sphere of warm light, just enough to see the path.

---

## SCENE 297
**Time:** 19:08:01 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, arrival

The house was dark.

He entered, lit the oil lamp in the main room, and the space transformed from empty to inhabited. His presence changed it, as Katsuhito had suggested presence changed meaning.

He unrolled the futon. Arranged the bedding. Lay down.

---

## SCENE 298
**Time:** 19:12:18 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, lying in darkness

The ceiling above him was shadow.

His body pressed against the futon, comfortable in the way bodies become comfortable when exhaustion finally wins. His mind continued processing—questions, observations, the accumulated data of an impossible day.

Sleep approached like a tide. He didn't resist.

---

## SCENE 299
**Time:** 19:15:35 JST — Sleep  
**Location:** Tsukino house, dreams

In the space between waking and sleep, he saw her.

A figure in white, standing at the edge of perception. Tall, slender, features obscured by light that had no source. She was watching him with patience that encompassed centuries.

*You did well today.*

The words weren't sound. They were impression—meaning transferred without vibration.

*Rest now. Tomorrow begins what today prepared.*

He tried to speak, to ask the questions burning in his mind. But sleep took him before his throat could form words.

The figure remained, watching, until he dreamed of his grandmother's kitchen and the smell of biscuits baking and the sound of her voice saying: *You always were too stubborn to stay dead.*

In the morning, he would remember the dream.

He would not remember the figure who stood guard through the night, silver hair cascading to the floor, watching her first son sleep in the house that had waited for him.
