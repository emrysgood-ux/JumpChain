## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR SHELDON

### He Gets:
- An uncle who knew his mother, who can tell him stories
- An aunt who will feed him and fuss over him
- Two cousins his own age to connect with
- Their spouses — Takeshi especially could be a friend
- Four young relatives to watch grow up
- Holidays where he's expected
- History — a family tree, graves to visit, photos to see
- Belonging — not as outsider, but as family returned

### Potential Scenes:
1. First phone call to Kiyoshi — awkward, emotional, important
2. First visit to Osaka — meeting everyone; overwhelmed but welcomed
3. New Year's gathering — chaos, food, being folded into traditions
4. Quiet afternoon with Kiyoshi — hearing stories about his mother
5. Fumiko visits Kamogata — curious cousin sees the old family home
6. Helping Takeshi with a job — bonding through practical work
7. Miki's attachment — the small child who decides he's safe
