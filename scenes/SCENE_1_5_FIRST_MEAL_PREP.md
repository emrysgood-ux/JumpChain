## SCENE 1.5: FIRST MEAL (PREPARATION)

**April 3, 1989 — ~18:00 JST**
**Location:** Main residence kitchen
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The knock came at exactly six o'clock.

Sheldon opened the door to find Tenchi standing in the hallway, still in his school clothes but with a small apron tied over them. The apron was too big—it had been made for an adult—and the boy had folded it several times at the waist to keep it from dragging on the floor.

"Ojii-chan says dinner is starting," Tenchi announced. "I'm helping tonight. Do you want to help too?"

The question was asked with the guileless directness of childhood—an invitation, not a test. Sheldon felt something warm spread through his chest.

"I would like that very much, Tenchi-kun."

The boy beamed and grabbed his hand, pulling him down the covered walkway toward the main residence with a strength that surprised him. Tenchi's fingers were small and warm, gripping Sheldon's much larger hand with the confidence of someone who had never been given a reason to doubt that adults would follow where he led.

*Sheru-nii.*

The name echoed in Sheldon's mind. He hadn't been anyone's brother—not really, not by blood—and the sudden weight of the title settled on his shoulders with more significance than it probably deserved. A child's nickname. Nothing more.

But it felt like a promise he didn't remember making.

---

The kitchen was larger than Sheldon had expected.

Traditional in design but clearly functional—a gas stove sat beside a wood-burning kamado that looked like it had been in use for generations, and the counters held a collection of ceramic bowls, wooden implements, and steel knives that spoke of serious cooking. Katsuhito stood at the sink, washing rice with the practiced efficiency of long routine.

"Tsukino-san." The priest didn't turn around. "Can you handle a knife?"

"Yes, Masaki-san."

"Good. The daikon needs cutting. Tenchi, show him where the vegetables are."

Tenchi led Sheldon to a small cold storage area—not a refrigerator in the modern sense, but a naturally cool alcove built into the north wall of the kitchen. Inside, vegetables waited in neat rows: daikon radish, several types of greens, small mushrooms, a bundle of green onions.

"Ojii-chan grows some of these," Tenchi said proudly. "Behind the shrine. I help with the watering sometimes."

Sheldon selected a daikon—pale and firm, about the length of his forearm—and carried it back to the cutting board Katsuhito had indicated. A knife waited there, its edge glinting in the kitchen light. He picked it up, tested the weight, and began to cut.

*Thin slices. Even thickness. Let the blade do the work.*

Grandmother's voice again, from a kitchen in Georgia that felt like another lifetime. She'd taught him to cut vegetables before she'd taught him to read—"A boy who can feed himself won't ever go hungry"—and his hands remembered the lessons even when his mind was elsewhere.

The daikon yielded to the blade in clean, even circles. Not beautiful, not artistic, but competent. Serviceable. The kind of cutting that would disappear into the dish without drawing attention to itself.

Katsuhito glanced over. "You've done this before."

"My grandmother taught me. She believed in self-sufficiency."

"A wise woman." The priest finished rinsing the rice and set it to soak. "Self-sufficiency is the foundation of everything else. A man who can feed himself, shelter himself, care for himself—that man is free. That man can choose his obligations rather than being chosen by them."

Sheldon continued cutting. "Is that a Shinto teaching?"

"It is a life teaching." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "Shinto is life, Tsukino-san. Not separate from it."

---

They worked in comfortable rhythm.

Katsuhito managed the rice and the miso soup, moving between stove and counter with the unhurried efficiency of someone who had made this meal thousands of times. Tenchi's job, apparently, was to set out the dishes—small ceramic bowls and plates that he retrieved from a cabinet and arranged on a tray with careful concentration.

Sheldon's assignment expanded from daikon to include slicing mushrooms, mincing green onions, and trimming the greens that would accompany the fish. Each task came with a quiet word from Katsuhito—"thinner," "smaller pieces," "yes, like that"—and Sheldon found himself falling into the instruction with something like relief.

This he could do. This made sense. The knife in his hand, the vegetables on the board, the accumulating evidence of a meal taking shape—these were real. These were grounded. These required no explanation beyond the simple logic of hunger and feeding.

"Sheru-nii, can you reach that?"

Tenchi was pointing at a jar on a high shelf—pickled vegetables, from the look of it. Sheldon stretched up and retrieved it easily, setting it on the counter within the boy's reach.

"Thank you!" Tenchi opened the jar with both hands, struggling slightly with the lid until it gave. Inside, pale slices of something—turnip, maybe—waited in brine. "These are Ojii-chan's favorite. He makes them himself."

"Your grandfather pickles his own vegetables?"

"He does many things himself," Katsuhito said from the stove. There was amusement in his voice. "Self-sufficiency, Tsukino-san. As I said."

---

The fish came last.

It was ayu—sweetfish, Katsuhito explained, from the river that ran through the valley below. He'd caught them that morning, and they'd been resting in salt since noon. Now he threaded them onto skewers with a practiced twist of his wrist, transforming each small fish into a shape like a swimmer frozen mid-leap.

"The form matters," the priest said, showing Sheldon the technique. "A fish should look alive even when it is cooking. Like this—see? The curve of the spine, the angle of the head. We honor the fish by presenting it beautifully."

Sheldon watched, memorizing the movements. His hands wanted to try—he could feel them itching with the desire to replicate what they'd seen—but he held back. This was not his kitchen. This was not his technique. Not yet.

"The fire should be hot but not fierce," Katsuhito continued, setting the skewered fish over the charcoal. "We want crisp skin, not burnt. Patience, Tsukino-san. The fish will tell you when it is ready."

"How?"

"Listen." The priest smiled. "The sizzle changes when the fat begins to render. The smell changes when the proteins set. The fish speaks, if you know how to hear it."

Sheldon stood beside the grill and listened. At first, he heard only the hiss of moisture meeting heat—a sound like rain on hot pavement, fierce and immediate. But as the fish cooked, the sound shifted. Softened. Became something rounder, more consistent.

"Now," Katsuhito said, and turned the skewers.

The fish on the underside was golden-brown, the skin crisp and glistening. The smell that rose from it was salt and smoke and something else—something alive, despite the death that had preceded it.

"How did you know?"

"Practice." The priest's eyes crinkled. "A few thousand fish, give or take. Eventually, the knowing becomes part of you. You will learn, Tsukino-san. Everyone does who is willing to pay attention."

---

The meal came together in stages.

Rice, lifted from the pot and placed in individual bowls with the precise portions Katsuhito specified. Miso soup, ladled into lacquer bowls that Tenchi carried to the table with both hands, tongue between his teeth in concentration. The fish, removed from the skewers and arranged on a single plate to be shared. Pickles. Greens dressed with a light sauce. Tea, brewed and poured.

By the time they finished, the kitchen looked like a meal had happened there—not messy, but used, the evidence of work visible in the scattered vegetable scraps and the dampness of the cutting board.

"Tenchi, take the rice to the table," Katsuhito said. "I'll bring the fish. Tsukino-san—" He paused, looking at Sheldon with an expression that might have been assessment. "Will you carry the soup?"

"Yes, Masaki-san."

The bowls were warm in his hands—just warm enough to feel the life of the food through the lacquer. Sheldon followed Tenchi through the hallway to the dining area, where the low table waited with cushions arranged on three sides.

A place for him. Already set. Already expected.

*Home,* some part of him thought, and the word didn't hurt as much as he'd expected.
