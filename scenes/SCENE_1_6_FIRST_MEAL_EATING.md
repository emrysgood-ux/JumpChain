## SCENE 1.6: FIRST MEAL (EATING)

**April 3, 1989 — ~19:30 JST**
**Location:** Main residence dining area
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

"Itadakimasu."

The word came from all three of them simultaneously—Sheldon's voice deeper, Tenchi's high and eager, Katsuhito's quiet and measured. A blessing and a beginning, the formal acknowledgment that food was about to be received.

Sheldon lifted his rice bowl with his left hand, his chopsticks with his right, and took the first bite.

The rice was perfect. Not the word he would have used in his previous life—rice had been rice, a vehicle for other flavors, a filler for empty corners of plates. But this rice was different. Each grain distinct, slightly sweet, with a texture that yielded exactly right under his teeth. He could taste the water it had been cooked in. He could taste the mountain.

"The rice comes from Yamamoto-san's fields," Katsuhito said, watching him eat. "He grows it in the valley below. Good water makes good rice."

"It's excellent, Masaki-san."

"Call it what it is. Good rice is one of the few things in life that requires no qualification." The priest smiled and turned to his own bowl. "Tenchi, how was school today?"

The boy swallowed a mouthful of fish before answering—bad manners, Sheldon noted, but no correction came from Katsuhito. Perhaps the rules were different here. Perhaps the old priest understood that children needed room to be children.

"We drew pictures," Tenchi said. "Yamada-sensei said mine was very good. It was a picture of the shrine."

"And what did you draw at the shrine?"

"The big tree." Tenchi's voice shifted slightly—quieter, more careful. "And the mountain. And you, Ojii-chan. Standing by the tree."

Katsuhito's chopsticks paused for just a moment—so brief Sheldon almost missed it—before resuming their work. "That sounds like a fine picture. I should like to see it."

"I left it at school. But I can bring it tomorrow."

"Do that."

Sheldon ate in silence, letting the conversation flow around him. There was something in the exchange he didn't understand—an undercurrent, a weight—but it wasn't his place to ask. He was a guest here, newly arrived. Some things took time to reveal themselves.

---

The fish was extraordinary.

Sheldon had eaten fish before—tilapia and catfish in Georgia, salmon and cod in California, whatever the convenience store offered near his Alaska lab. But this was something else. The skin crackled between his teeth, giving way to flesh that was firm and clean and tasted like the river it had come from. No muddy undertones, no fishiness. Just the pure essence of a creature that had lived well and died quickly.

"You like the ayu," Katsuhito observed.

"I've never tasted anything like it."

"The river here is very clean. Too clean, perhaps—the water comes from the mountain, filtered through rock and forest, and brings little sediment with it. The fish grow slowly, but they grow well." The priest took a bite of his own portion. "Some things cannot be rushed, Tsukino-san. The fish knows this. Perhaps we should learn from the fish."

"Ojii-chan talks like that a lot," Tenchi confided, leaning toward Sheldon conspiratorially. "About fish and trees and things. I don't always understand what he means."

"Understanding comes when it comes," Katsuhito said mildly. "There is no rush for that, either."

Tenchi made a face—the universal expression of a child confronted with adult wisdom he found impractical—and returned to his meal.

---

The conversation drifted to practical matters.

"You mentioned work," Sheldon said, when the meal had settled into its middle rhythm. "At the shrine. What would that involve?"

"Maintenance, primarily. The grounds need tending—weeding, sweeping, repairs when weather allows. The steps need regular attention. Visitors require assistance." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "It is not demanding work, but it is constant. A shrine is a living thing, Tsukino-san. It must be cared for, or it dies."

"I understand."

"Do you? Perhaps." The priest's eyes held something Sheldon couldn't read. "You said you were a... what was the word? A scientist?"

The question caught him off guard. He hadn't said what he was. Had he? The memories of his earlier conversation were foggy, like everything else.

"I was. Am. I studied physics. Theoretical work, mostly, though my last position was more practical."

"Physics." Katsuhito said the word carefully, as if testing its weight. "The study of how things work."

"The study of why things work the way they do. The underlying laws that govern reality."

"Ah." The priest smiled. "Then you and I are in similar businesses, Tsukino-san. I also study the underlying laws that govern reality. I simply call them by different names."

Tenchi began to flag around eight o'clock.

His head drooped over his rice bowl, catching itself, drooping again. The energy that had carried him through the afternoon was finally fading, and Sheldon watched the boy fight against sleep with the stubborn determination of childhood.

"Tenchi," Katsuhito said gently. "Finish your rice and say goodnight. You have school tomorrow."

"I'm not tired."

"Of course not. Nevertheless, finish your rice."

The boy complied with the slow, exaggerated movements of someone who was definitely not tired. His final bite of rice took approximately thirty seconds to chew. His goodbye bow to Sheldon was careful and formal, though his eyes were already half-closed.

"Goodnight, Sheru-nii."

"Goodnight, Tenchi-kun. Sleep well."

"You'll be here tomorrow?"

The question was simple, but something in it made Sheldon's throat tighten. The boy wasn't asking out of curiosity. He was asking out of need—the need of a child who had already lost too many people, already learned that presence was not guaranteed.

"Yes," Sheldon said. "I'll be here."

Tenchi nodded once, satisfied, and shuffled out of the room toward wherever his bed waited. His footsteps faded down the hall, followed by the slide of a door opening and closing.

Silence settled over the table.

---

Katsuhito poured sake into a small cup—just one, Sheldon noticed. The priest didn't offer him any.

"He likes you," Katsuhito said, sipping. "Tenchi. He does not warm to people easily. Not anymore."

"He mentioned his grandmother. That she's gone."

"His mother." The priest's voice was flat. Careful. "Kiyone. She died last year. Illness that came on quickly and did not respond to treatment."

*His mother.* Not grandmother. Sheldon had misunderstood.

"I'm sorry."

"So am I." Katsuhito looked toward the door where Tenchi had disappeared. "She was a remarkable woman. Kind and fierce in equal measure. Tenchi has her eyes."

Sheldon thought of the boy's face—serious, watchful, older than its years. "He seems... well-adjusted, for a child who's experienced that kind of loss."

"He is resilient. Children often are, when they are given space to grieve without being overwhelmed by the grief of others." The priest finished his sake and set the cup down. "His father visits on weekends. Works in the city during the week. It is... a compromise. Not ideal, but manageable."

"And you take care of him the rest of the time?"

"I do what I can. An old man's care is not the same as a parent's, but it is what we have." Katsuhito met Sheldon's eyes directly. "You are good with him, Tsukino-san. He saw something in you. I do not know what. But he saw it."

Sheldon didn't know how to respond to that. He had no experience with children—none that he remembered, anyway. His life had been equations and laboratories and the cold precision of particle physics. Nothing that would have prepared him to be seen by a grieving four-year-old.

But the boy had named him brother. And he had accepted.

"I will try to be worthy of it," he said finally.

Katsuhito nodded once. "That is all any of us can do."
