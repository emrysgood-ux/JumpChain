## SCENE 1.2: THE WALK

**April 3, 1989 — ~14:50 JST**  
**Location:** Field to Road, Asakuchi District  
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

Every step felt like a revelation.

Sheldon had forgotten what it meant to walk without accounting for his body—without that constant low-level negotiation between intention and capability that had become so automatic he'd stopped noticing it years ago. The careful way he'd learned to shift his weight to spare his left knee. The slight hunch he'd developed to ease the pressure on his lower back. The way he'd unconsciously avoided stairs when an elevator was available.

All of it was gone.

His feet pressed into the soft earth, and he felt each compression distinctly: the grass bending beneath his weight, the soil yielding just enough, the springback as he lifted his heel for the next step. His ankles flexed without stiffness. His knees bent without complaint. His hips moved in smooth arcs that required no conscious attention.

He was walking the way people walked in movies. The way athletes walked. The way he himself must have walked once, before age and work and the accumulated weight of living had taught his body to negotiate rather than simply act.

*This was what it felt like to be young.*

The thought arrived with startling clarity. Not just the absence of age—that would have been remarkable enough—but the *presence* of something he'd lost so gradually he hadn't realized it was gone. A body that assumed it could do anything. A body that moved before the mind finished asking.

For the first time in decades, Sheldon wasn't thinking about his body at all.

---

The field stretched around him as he walked—grass and purple flowers and the occasional outcropping of dark stone. The mountains to the north rose in layers of green and shadow, their peaks hidden in haze. To the south, the road grew closer with each step, its gray surface becoming more distinct against the green.

He catalogued observations as he moved, the physicist's habit of recording data serving as a kind of anchor. The sun's position: westering, perhaps three hours until dusk. The temperature: comfortable, maybe sixty-five degrees Fahrenheit. The humidity: high enough that he could smell the moisture in the air, but not oppressive. The wind: light, from the northwest, carrying scents of earth and distant woodsmoke.

Spring. Definitely spring. The vegetation confirmed it—new growth everywhere, that particular shade of green that only existed in the first flush of the growing season. Cherry blossoms visible on a tree at the field's edge, pale pink against the blue sky.

Japan. Almost certainly Japan. The vegetation patterns, the architecture visible in the distance, the kanji on his documents, the yen in his wallet. He'd spent eighteen months in Kyoto during his postdoc—long enough to recognize the landscape, if not to place exactly where he was.

But when? His watch said 2:47—or rather, it had said 2:47 when he first looked at it, and now it said 2:53, the second hand making its patient circuit of the dial. But what *day*? What year?

He didn't have answers. He kept walking.

---

The grass thinned as he approached the road, giving way to harder ground and scattered gravel. Sheldon paused at the edge of the paved surface, looking both directions.

The road was narrow—barely wide enough for two cars to pass, with no sidewalk or shoulder. To his left, it curved around a bend and disappeared behind a line of trees. To his right, it ran straight for perhaps half a mile before vanishing over a gentle rise.

A sign stood at the intersection of the road and a smaller dirt track that led up into the trees. Sheldon walked to it and read the kanji without difficulty:

*Masaki Shrine — 3.2 km*

The arrow pointed up the dirt track, toward the mountains.

He stood very still for a moment, processing.

The name meant nothing to him. Masaki. A family name, presumably—shrines in Japan were often named for the families who maintained them. He'd visited dozens of shrines during his time in Kyoto, from the massive complexes at Fushimi Inari to tiny roadside hokora no bigger than a mailbox. They were part of the landscape here, as common as churches in rural Georgia.

But why was there a sign pointing to a shrine from the middle of an empty field? And why had he woken up precisely here, within sight of it?

The coincidence felt too precise. Too arranged.

*Someone had done this.*

He looked at the wallet in his hand—he'd pulled it out again without realizing—and the address printed on his residence card. The kanji was too small to read in full, but he could make out part of it: 岡山県... Okayama Prefecture.

So he was in Okayama. Western Honshu, Chugoku region, not far from Hiroshima. He'd passed through once on the Shinkansen but had never stopped. Rice paddies and mountains and a reputation for mild weather.

And apparently, a shrine called Masaki somewhere up that dirt road.

The bird called again—that three-note song, questioning and patient. This time it came from closer, somewhere in the trees that lined the road.

---

A sound reached him from his left: an engine, growing louder. Sheldon stepped back from the road instinctively, giving room for whatever was approaching.

It was a kei truck—one of those tiny Japanese commercial vehicles that seemed too small to be practical but somehow carried everything from produce to construction materials. This one was painted an indeterminate color between white and gray, its bed loaded with wooden crates that rattled as it approached.

The driver slowed as he came around the bend, clearly surprised to see someone standing at the roadside. Sheldon saw a weather-worn face behind the windshield, dark eyes widening slightly.

The truck came to a stop a few meters away. The driver's window rolled down.

"Are you lost?"

The Japanese came out as easily as breathing—more easily than it should have, given how long it had been since he'd spoken it regularly. Sheldon had studied Japanese for years, had lived in Kyoto, had given academic presentations in imperfect but functional Japanese. But that was a decade ago. Languages atrophied without practice.

This didn't feel atrophied at all.

"I'm looking for this address." Sheldon held up his residence card, showing the address printed on it. "Do you know where this is?"

The farmer leaned out his window, squinting at the card. His face shifted through a series of expressions—confusion, recognition, something that might have been surprise.

"Tsukino?" He looked up at Sheldon, really looking now, taking in his face and his clothes and his general presence. "You're the Tsukino family?"

"Apparently." Sheldon kept his voice neutral. He had no idea what reaction that name should provoke. "Do you know where the house is?"

"Up near the shrine. Masaki Shrine." The farmer pointed toward the dirt road and the sign Sheldon had just read. "The old house—it's been empty for years. Four years, maybe five." He paused. "I didn't know anyone was coming."

"Neither did I."

Something in Sheldon's tone—or perhaps something in his expression—made the farmer's eyes soften slightly. The suspicion that had been building there faded into something more like concern.

"You don't look like you've had an easy journey." The farmer glanced at the empty field behind Sheldon, clearly wondering where he'd come from. "I'm heading to the village. You want a ride as far as the bus stop? You can catch the next bus up to the shrine from there."

It was unexpected kindness. Sheldon had learned not to expect kindness, especially from strangers, especially in situations he couldn't explain.

"Thank you," he said. "I would appreciate that."
