## SCENE 1.13: FIRST NIGHT SLEEP

**April 3, 1989 — ~22:00+ JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (dream POV)

---

In his dreams, he was in his grandmother's kitchen.

Not the kitchen as he'd last seen it—cramped and aging, the linoleum peeling in the corners, the refrigerator humming its dying song. This was the kitchen of his childhood, impossibly vast, every surface gleaming with the attention she had lavished on it. The smell of cornbread filled the air. Late afternoon light slanted through windows that sparkled like they'd been polished with angels' breath.

Grandmother stood at the stove, her back to him, her housedress the faded blue he remembered from a thousand mornings.

"You're late," she said without turning around.

"I know."

"Supper's almost cold."

"I'm sorry."

She turned then, and her face was the face he remembered—round and soft and lined with the years she'd lived before he was born. Her eyes were kind. They had always been kind, even when she was scolding him.

"You always say sorry," she said. "Like it changes things."

"Doesn't it?"

"No. But you say it anyway. That's why I love you."

She held out her hand, and he stepped forward to take it—

—and the kitchen dissolved.

He was in the field again. The grass pressed against his cheek. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast and empty.

But something was different this time.

Someone was standing at the edge of his vision. A figure in white, tall and slender, their features unclear in the bright light. They were watching him. Not moving. Just watching.

He tried to turn his head to see them clearly, but his body wouldn't cooperate. Dream-logic. The figure stayed at the periphery, always just out of focus, always just beyond recognition.

"Who are you?" he asked, though his lips didn't move.

The figure didn't answer. But something in the way they stood—patient, gentle, infinitely sad—made him feel that they knew him. Knew everything about him. Had always known.

The grass rustled without wind.

The figure began to fade.

"Wait—"

---

He woke once in the night.

Not fully—just enough to register the darkness, the unfamiliar ceiling, the weight of the comforter across his chest. The dream was already slipping away, dissolving into fragments that his conscious mind couldn't hold.

A kitchen. A field. Someone watching.

He couldn't remember who.

The owl called again outside, and the sound was comforting somehow. Real. Present. A reminder that the world continued even when he wasn't conscious to observe it.

Sheldon turned on his side, pulled the comforter higher, and let sleep take him again.

This time, there were no dreams.

Just darkness, and rest, and the slow passage of hours toward morning.

---

Outside the window, the mountain watched him sleep.

The great tree's branches moved slightly in the night breeze—or perhaps not in the breeze at all. Perhaps in response to something else. Something that had arrived today. Something that had changed the patterns of the shrine in ways too subtle to measure but impossible to ignore.

The stars turned overhead. The owl found its prey and fell silent. The shrine settled into the deep quiet of the late hours, when even the birds slept and only the mountain remained awake.

Day one was complete.

Whatever came next would begin with morning.
