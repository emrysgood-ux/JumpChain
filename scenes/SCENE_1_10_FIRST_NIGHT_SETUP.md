## SCENE 1.10: FIRST NIGHT SETUP

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:15 JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The futon cabinet opened with a soft click.

Inside, neatly folded: a mattress pad, a thick comforter, a pillow in a clean cotton case. Everything smelled of cedar and sunshine—stored carefully, aired regularly, waiting for exactly this moment.

Sheldon lifted the mattress and carried it to the center of the room. The weight was nothing. He'd carried heavier things in his previous life—boxes of equipment, stacks of paper, the accumulated detritus of an academic career—but this felt different. Effortless in a way that went beyond the object's actual mass.

He spread the mattress on the tatami, smoothing it flat with hands that moved with more precision than he expected. Then the comforter, folded back at one corner. Then the pillow, centered at the head.

A bed. His bed, for tonight at least.

---

He should change clothes, he realized.

The shirt and slacks he'd been wearing all day—that he'd woken up wearing, in a field, with no memory of putting them on—were dirty now. Grass stains on the slacks from his awakening. A smudge of fish oil on the shirt cuff from dinner preparation. Normal wear from a normal day that had been anything but normal.

But he had no other clothes. The wallet in his pocket contained documents and money, not a change of wardrobe. Whoever had prepared him for this new life had apparently expected him to acquire clothing on his own.

Tomorrow, then. Tonight, he would sleep in what he had.

He undid the buttons of his shirt slowly, pulling it over his head, and paused.

The mirror. There was a small one on the wall near the tokonoma—not large, but enough to show his face and upper body if he stood close.

Sheldon walked to the mirror and looked.

---

The face that looked back was his.

Brown skin, darker than he remembered—or no, not darker, just healthier. The pallid undertone that had marked his years under fluorescent lights was gone. His cheeks had color. His eyes were clear.

He was younger than he expected. Not young, exactly—the lines around his eyes remained, the first traces of gray in his short hair—but younger than thirty-eight. The face in the mirror might have belonged to a man of thirty, perhaps even less. A man who hadn't spent decades squinting at equations, hunching over microscopes, neglecting the body that carried his thoughts.

He looked at his chest. Compact, as it had always been—he was built low to the ground, his grandmother's "little bull," never going to be tall or slender. But the softness he remembered was different now. Not gone, but... firmer. Denser. As if the muscle underneath had been rebuilt according to better specifications.

The scar on his shoulder—from a childhood fall, a broken bottle, twelve stitches in the emergency room—was gone.

He checked his right hand. The apple scar. Gone.

His left knee, which had complained every morning since his twenties. He bent it, straightened it, bent it again. Silence. No creak. No ache. Nothing.

*What happened to me?*

The question had no answer. The mirror showed only what was, not how it had come to be. A body rebuilt. Restored. Made ready for... something.

Something he didn't understand.

---

He turned away from the mirror and finished undressing.

The slacks he folded and set aside—they would need cleaning, but they were salvageable. The shirt might need more work. His shoes, which had survived the mountain climb without apparent damage, he left by the door.

In just his undershorts, he felt vulnerable in a way he hadn't anticipated. Not cold—the room was comfortable, and the comforter waited to wrap him in warmth. But exposed. A stranger in a strange place, with nothing between himself and the world but skin he didn't quite recognize.

He lay down on the futon.

The mattress accepted him perfectly—not too soft, not too firm, molding to his body in a way that suggested it had been waiting for exactly his shape. The pillow cradled his head. The comforter settled over him like a held breath.

He stared at the ceiling and tried to make sense of the day.
