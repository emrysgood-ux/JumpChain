## SCENE 1.1: THE AWAKENING

**April 3, 1989 — 14:47:23 JST**
**Location:** Field below Masaki Shrine
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The first thing was light.

Not the harsh fluorescent glare of the laboratory or the cold blue of monitoring screens. This was warm. Diffuse. The kind of light that came through leaves, through sky, through the membrane between sleeping and waking.

I wasn't sleeping.

The second thing was grass. I could feel it against my palms—individual blades pressing into skin, soft and slightly damp. The sensation was so specific, so immediate, that for a moment it was the only thing that existed. Just grass and light and the slow realization that I was lying on my back, staring up at a sky so blue it seemed artificial.

I tried to remember how I'd gotten here.

Alaska. The facility. Final calibrations on the detector array, Maria's voice over the intercom asking if I wanted coffee, the way the readouts had spiked just before—

The light.

Not this light. That light had been different. White-hot and absolute, the kind of brightness that didn't give your eyes time to adjust because it was already too late. I'd looked up at exactly the wrong moment. I'd seen the cascade failure begin, watched the containment fields collapse in sequence like dominoes made of lightning, and I'd had just enough time to think *oh* before—

Before what?

I was lying in a field. The sky was blue. Birds were singing somewhere nearby, a three-note pattern that repeated with mechanical precision. I could feel my heart beating in my chest, which seemed significant for reasons I couldn't quite articulate.

The dead don't have heartbeats. That was the general consensus.

I sat up.

The motion was easier than it should have been. My body moved without the usual negotiations—no stiff joints protesting, no lower back sending urgent memos about proper lifting technique. I just... sat up. Like sitting up was something bodies did naturally, without complaint.

The field stretched around me in every direction. Grass, mostly. Wild and uncut, swaying slightly in a breeze I could barely feel. Mountains in the distance, blue-gray shapes against the horizon. Trees closer, a dark line of forest maybe two hundred meters away. The sun was behind me, warm on the back of my neck, casting my shadow long across the grass.

I looked down at my hands.

They were my hands. The same hands that had spent years at keyboards and lab equipment, that had written dissertations and calibrated instruments and made coffee at three in the morning when the data refused to cooperate. But they looked... different. Younger, maybe. The calluses were gone. The small scar on my left index finger from the time I'd sliced it open on a broken beaker in grad school—that was gone too.

I pushed up my sleeves and checked my forearms. The burn mark from the soldering accident in Kyoto. Gone. The weird patch of rough skin I'd had since childhood that no dermatologist could explain. Gone.

My body was the same shape—short, stocky, familiar—but it had been... cleaned. Reset. Like someone had taken the original blueprints and manufactured a fresh copy, minus all the accumulated damage.

I got to my feet.

Again, too easy. My knees didn't crack. My ankles didn't protest. I just stood, and then I was standing, and the world didn't spin or tilt or do any of the things it usually did when I moved too quickly.

The field was real. I was standing in it. These seemed like facts worth acknowledging.

I patted my pockets and found a wallet. Leather, worn at the edges, surprisingly familiar in my hand. Inside: a driver's license with my photo, issued to someone named Tsukino Sheldon. Japanese characters I could read without thinking about it, an address in a prefecture I'd never heard of, a birthdate that was mine.

Tsukino. The name sat strangely in my mind, familiar and foreign at the same time. Like hearing someone mispronounce a word you'd only ever seen written down.

There was cash in the wallet too. Japanese yen. And bank books—multiple bank books—with account numbers and balances that seemed impossible for someone who'd spent most of his career on postdoc stipends.

I put the wallet back in my pocket.

The laboratory had been in Alaska. The field was clearly not in Alaska. The documents said I was Japanese, which I wasn't—or hadn't been—or—

I took a breath. The air was clean. Startlingly clean, compared to what I remembered. No chemical undertaste from the facility's ventilation system, no hint of ozone or processed air. Just... air. The kind of air that came from being surrounded by growing things and open sky.

The cascade failure had been fatal. I'd known that. I'd seen the numbers on the readouts, seen the look on Maria's face through the glass, and I'd known. There hadn't been time to be afraid. There'd barely been time to be surprised.

And now I was standing in a field in Japan with a body that felt like it had never been used and documents that said I belonged here.

I started walking toward the treeline.

It wasn't a conscious decision, exactly. More like a recognition that standing in the middle of a field wasn't going to answer any questions, and the trees at least offered direction. Purpose. Something to move toward.

My legs carried me without complaint. Each step felt solid, certain, like my feet remembered how to walk even if the rest of me wasn't sure what was happening. The grass brushed against my pants—dark slacks, the kind I would have worn to work—and the sun moved slowly across the sky as I walked.

The treeline grew closer. Cedar, mostly, tall and dark and smelling of something clean and ancient. A path emerged between the trunks, dirt packed smooth by what looked like years of foot traffic. The path headed uphill, curving away into the shadows under the canopy.

I stopped at the edge of the forest and looked back.

The field was empty. No indication of how I'd gotten there, no convenient explanation written in the grass. Just a landscape that looked like it had existed for centuries before I'd appeared in it, and would continue existing long after I left.

The birds were still singing. That same three-note pattern, over and over.

I turned and entered the trees.

The air was cooler under the canopy, the light filtered through layers of green and brown. The path was clear, well-maintained, leading upward at a gentle grade. My feet found their rhythm on the packed earth, and I let them carry me forward.

Somewhere ahead, I could see the path opening up again. A glimpse of sky, a suggestion of cleared ground, and something else—stone, maybe, arranged in a pattern too regular to be natural.

Steps.

A long flight of stone steps, leading up the mountain.

I stopped at the base and looked up. The steps climbed through the forest, disappearing around a curve maybe fifty meters above me. Old stone, worn smooth at the edges by generations of feet. A torii gate stood at the bottom, red paint faded to something closer to rust, marking the transition from forest path to something else.

A shrine. This was the approach to a shrine.

I didn't know how I knew that. But I knew it the same way I knew my own name—knew both my names, Carter and Tsukino, existing simultaneously in my head like two versions of the same document.

The stone steps waited.

I put my foot on the first one and began to climb.
