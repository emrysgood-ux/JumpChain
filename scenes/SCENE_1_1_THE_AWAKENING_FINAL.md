## SCENE 1.1: THE AWAKENING

**April 3, 1989 — 14:47 JST**  
**Location:** Fallow agricultural field, Asakuchi District, Okayama Prefecture  
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The smell of grass.

That registered first—not thought, not memory, just sensation pressing against his cheek. Green. Damp. Alive.

Sheldon did not open his eyes.

His body catalogued input the way decades of laboratory work had taught it: temperature mild, humidity high, earth recently rained on but not yet dried. Somewhere nearby, wind moved through vegetation with a sound like whispered questions. And beneath that, a silence so complete it felt deliberate. Architectural. As if someone had built this quiet moment specifically for him to wake into.

*I died.*

The thought surfaced without urgency. He let it exist.

He had been in Alaska. The particle accelerator. Final calibrations on equipment that should have been safe but wasn't—containment systems failing in cascade, alarms screaming, and Maria Chen's face through the observation window twisted into something he'd never seen on her before. Her mouth had shaped his name. Her hand had pressed flat against the glass. Her eyes had held the particular horror of someone watching the unpreventable unfold in real time.

He had looked up at exactly the wrong moment. He had known.

*Oh.*

Not fear. Not regret. Just that small, quiet recognition, like finally placing a face seen in a crowd. A thought that felt almost peaceful: *So this is how it ends.*

Then nothing.

Then grass.

---

Somewhere nearby, a bird called.

Three notes. High, questioning, with a pause between each one that seemed to wait for an answer that never came. The call repeated, patient and unhurried, marking time in a language Sheldon didn't recognize. He had never heard that bird before. He would have remembered—the sound was too distinctive, too strange, too beautiful to forget.

*Open your eyes.*

The command came from somewhere older than thought. His grandmother's voice, maybe—Dorothy Mae Washington, who had raised him after his parents died and who had died herself when he was thirty-two. Or perhaps it was the part of him that had survived doctoral committees and grant reviews and three in the morning in a lab when the numbers refused to cooperate. The part that said: *Facts first. Panic later. You can fall apart when you understand what you're falling apart about.*

Sheldon opened his eyes.

---

Blue.

Not the flat gray of an Alaskan spring but actual *blue*, deep and clear and stretching forever. A single cloud drifted overhead, white and impossibly soft, the kind of cloud children drew with crayons. The sky was so vivid it seemed almost aggressive—demanding to be noticed, refusing to be ignored.

He stared at it for what felt like hours.

Then he sat up.

---

The motion came easier than it should have.

That was the first wrong thing. Sheldon had been thirty-seven years old when he died—not ancient, but old enough to have accumulated a catalog of small complaints. The stiffness in his lower back from years of hunching over equipment. The ache in his left knee from a fall during his Berkeley days. The grinding protest of shoulders that had spent too many hours at keyboards and lab benches. The irregular beat of a heart that his doctor had said was "probably nothing to worry about, but let's schedule a follow-up."

None of it was there.

His body rose like water finding its level—smooth, automatic, without negotiation. He didn't even think about the motion until it was complete, and by then he was sitting upright in ankle-high grass with his legs crossed beneath him and his hands resting on his thighs.

He looked down at his hands.

They were his hands. The same broad palms his grandmother had said were "good for working." The same blunt fingers that had spent decades manipulating laboratory equipment. The same darkness of his skin against the pale green of crushed grass.

But the small scar on his right thumb was gone.

He turned his hand over, examining it from every angle. The scar had been there since he was nine—a paring knife, an apple, his grandmother's sharp voice: *"Not toward yourself, baby. Never toward yourself."* The lesson and the scar had both stayed with him for nearly thirty years. He could have drawn the shape of it from memory: a thin white line curving around the pad of his thumb, barely visible but always present.

Now the skin was smooth. Unbroken. Perfect.

He pressed his left hand to his chest, counting heartbeats. One. Two. Three. Four. Each one steady, strong, arriving exactly when expected. No skipped beats. No irregularity. No flutter of PVCs that had made him nervous during the last few years, even though his doctor had assured him they were benign.

His heart was beating like a twenty-year-old's heart.

His body was wrong.

His body was *fixed*.

---

Sheldon stood.

Again the motion came without effort—no pushing, no struggling, no careful negotiation with protesting joints. One moment he was sitting; the next he was on his feet, balanced and stable on ground that should have been uneven beneath him.

He was in a field. Grass stretched in every direction, broken only by a line of trees in the middle distance. Mountains rose beyond, their slopes covered in deep green forest. Small purple flowers dotted the grass around his feet—delicate things, five-petaled, clustered in patches like scattered confetti.

The bird called again. Three notes. High. Questioning.

Sheldon turned in a slow circle, cataloguing.

North: the treeline, climbing upward toward forested hills. The trees looked different from anything he knew—not the towering redwoods of California or the spruce of Alaska, but something shorter, denser, with a settled quality that spoke of centuries rather than decades.

South: a road visible perhaps a quarter mile distant, cutting across the landscape in a gray ribbon. He could see a vehicle moving along it—small, distant, the sound of its engine a faint buzz.

East and west: more grass, more mountains, more sky.

Above: that impossible blue, and the sun westering slowly toward what would eventually be evening.

He wasn't in Alaska.

He wasn't anywhere he recognized.

---

Something caught his attention—a weight at his left wrist that hadn't been there before. Hadn't been there before he died, he corrected himself, because apparently he was now dividing his existence into *before* and *after* like chapters in a book.

A watch. Silver-toned metal, white face, brown leather strap. The kind of simple, elegant timepiece his grandmother would have approved of. Not the digital Casio he'd worn for years—the one that displayed the time in numbers and beeped every hour and never required winding—but something older. Mechanical. Analog.

He read the face: 2:47 PM.

Someone had put this watch on his wrist while he was unconscious. Someone had buckled it carefully, making sure it was comfortable. Someone had wound it so it would be running when he woke.

Someone had *dressed* him.

He looked down at his clothes for the first time. Gray slacks, neatly pressed. White button-down shirt, collar open, no tie. Black leather shoes that fit perfectly and showed signs of wear at the toe. A handkerchief folded in his right front pocket—white cotton, crisp edges, exactly the way Dorothy Mae had taught him to fold them.

None of these clothes had existed before he died.

His hands moved without conscious direction, checking pockets. Back right: a wallet, leather, worn at the edges. He pulled it out and opened it, and the world tilted slightly on its axis.

A driver's license. A Japanese driver's license, with kanji he could read as easily as English and a photograph of his own face looking back at him. The name printed beside it: 月野シェルドン. *Tsukino Sheldon.*

Not Carter. Tsukino.

Not the name he was born with.

He flipped through the rest of the wallet's contents. Bank books—two of them, with balances that looked significant even without converting the yen to dollars. A resident card confirming his permanent resident status. More documents in Japanese: what looked like family registration papers, official stamps in red ink, an address that meant nothing to him.

And cash. A thick fold of bills in denominations he recognized from his postdoc days in Kyoto—ten thousand yen notes, crisp and new.

Someone had prepared all of this for him.

Someone had given him clothes and money and identity and placed him in a field in what appeared to be rural Japan while he was unconscious.

Someone had *done* this.

But who? And why? And *how*?

---

Sheldon stood very still for a long moment, the wallet open in his hands, the watch ticking quietly at his wrist.

The bird called again. Three notes. Questioning.

He had been a physicist. Four doctorates, if anyone was counting—theoretical physics, applied mathematics, materials science, computational chemistry. He had spent his entire adult life learning to take the impossible and make it possible, to take the inexplicable and explain it, to take the universe's most stubborn mysteries and force them to yield their secrets.

This was beyond anything he knew.

He was dead. He remembered dying. He remembered the light consuming him, the brief instant of knowing, the absolute cessation that had followed.

And yet he was standing in a field in Japan with a new name and a healed body and a wallet full of money, and the sun was moving slowly toward evening, and a bird he didn't recognize was calling from somewhere in the trees.

*Water, food, shelter.*

His grandmother's voice again—the rule she had drilled into him when he was young. The hierarchy of survival when everything else was chaos. *Figure out what you need to stay alive. Everything else can wait.*

He was thirsty. Not desperately so, but enough that he noticed it—a dryness in his throat, a faint headache beginning behind his eyes. His body had needs. His body was real. His body was, impossibly, *alive*.

The road lay to the south.

Sheldon put the wallet back in his pocket and began to walk.
