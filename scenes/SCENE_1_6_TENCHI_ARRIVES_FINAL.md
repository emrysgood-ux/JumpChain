## SCENE 1.6: TENCHI ARRIVES

**April 3, 1989 — ~17:15 JST**  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine residence area  
**POV:** Multi (Chronological Interleaving)

### POV: TENCHI — 17:15

The steps were always the hardest part.

Tenchi knew there were exactly three hundred and twenty of them because he'd counted twice. Once on a day when Grandfather was busy and he'd had nothing else to do, and once on a day when he was very sad and counting had helped him not think about being sad.

Today he wasn't sad, just tired. Kindergarten had been long, and the bus ride had been longer, and now there were all those steps between him and dinner and his beetle and his bed.

But he climbed them anyway, because that was what you did.

His school bag hung heavy on his shoulders, full of the craft project they'd made today—a paper fish on a stick that was supposed to swim in the wind. His teacher said they were for Boy's Day, which was coming up soon. Tenchi wasn't sure why fish had anything to do with being a boy, but he'd colored his fish very carefully in orange and gold.

He counted the steps as he climbed. One, two, three, four...

By step two hundred, he wasn't counting anymore. He was just climbing, one foot after the other, the way Grandfather had taught him. "The mountain doesn't care if you're tired," Grandfather always said. "It only cares if you keep walking."

Tenchi kept walking.

### POV: SHELDON — 17:18

Sheldon heard the footsteps before he saw the child.

Small feet on stone, the particular rhythm of someone climbing stairs with more determination than energy. He turned toward the sound, watching the path that led down to the steps—the same steps he'd climbed less than an hour ago.

A boy appeared at the top.

He was small—maybe three and a half feet tall, with dark hair cut in a practical bowl shape and eyes that seemed too serious for his round face. A yellow school bag hung from his shoulders, heavy with the accumulated contents of a day. He was breathing hard from the climb, his cheeks flushed, but he walked steadily toward them without pausing to rest.

"Ah," the priest said, his voice warming. "Tenchi. Good timing."

The boy's eyes went from his grandfather to Sheldon and stayed there.

Sheldon had been looked at by children before—his grandmother's church had been full of them, curious about the quiet teenager who helped in the kitchen and never seemed to play with anyone his own age. But he'd never been looked at quite like this. Tenchi's gaze was frank, unguarded, conducting an assessment that had nothing to do with social convention and everything to do with some internal calculus Sheldon couldn't read.

"Who's that?" the boy asked. Direct. No preamble.

"This is Tsukino-san," Katsuhito said. "He's going to be staying at the old house for a while. Tsukino-san, this is my great-grandson, Tenchi."

"Hello," Tenchi said to Sheldon. His voice was high but steady.

"Hello," Sheldon replied. "You must be tired from climbing all those steps."

Tenchi considered this. "Yes," he said after a moment. "But I'm four. I can do them."

There was a kind of fierce pride in the statement that made Sheldon smile despite everything. "I'm sure you can."

### POV: TENCHI — 17:20

The new person was tall. Taller than Dad. His skin was darker than anyone Tenchi knew, and his clothes looked like the kind of clothes grown-ups wore when they went to meetings, but less clean. Like he'd been rolling in grass.

He smiled when Tenchi said he could do the steps. It was a nice smile. Tired, but nice.

"Are you from America?" Tenchi asked. Teacher had been talking about America last week. It was very far away, across the ocean.

"Yes," the tall man said. "A place called Georgia."

Tenchi didn't know where Georgia was, but he nodded like he did. "Is it nice?"

"It was warm. Warmer than here."

"I like warm." Tenchi set down his school bag—it was getting heavy. "Grandfather, can I show him where to wash his hands before dinner?"

Grandfather made a sound that was almost a laugh but not quite. "That would be very helpful, Tenchi. Tsukino-san has had a long journey."

Tenchi looked at the tall man. The tall man looked at Tenchi.

"Okay," Tenchi said, and held out his hand.

### POV: SHELDON — 17:22

The child was offering his hand.

It was such a simple gesture—automatic for a four-year-old who hadn't yet learned to distrust strangers. Tenchi held out his small hand with the same matter-of-fact confidence he'd used to announce that he could climb the steps, and waited for Sheldon to take it.

Sheldon's throat tightened unexpectedly.

When was the last time someone had offered him their hand like this? Without calculation, without agenda, without the careful social choreography that adults learned to perform? He couldn't remember. Maybe never. Maybe this child, in the first five minutes of their acquaintance, was doing something no one had done in Sheldon's entire previous life.

He took the hand.

Tenchi's fingers were small and warm, wrapping around Sheldon's with surprising strength. The boy turned and began walking toward a stone basin that stood near the main building, tugging Sheldon along with the confidence of someone who had walked this path a thousand times.

"You wash your hands here before eating," Tenchi explained, his voice taking on the cadence of someone repeating a lesson they'd memorized. "Grandfather says it's important because germs are invisible enemies and we have to fight them every day."

"Your grandfather is right."

"I know." Tenchi said this with perfect certainty. "Grandfather is always right about shrine things."

They reached the basin—a stone rectangle with water trickling in from a bamboo pipe. A wooden dipper hung beside it, worn smooth by years of use.

"You take the dipper," Tenchi demonstrated, "and you pour water on your left hand, then your right hand, then you swish water in your mouth and spit it out, but I don't like the spitting part so Grandfather says I can just rinse my hands."

Sheldon followed the instructions, the cold water shocking against his skin in a way that felt almost cleansing. The late afternoon light caught the water droplets as they fell back into the basin, turning them briefly to gold.

"Thank you," he said when he'd finished. "That was very helpful."

Tenchi nodded, accepting the gratitude as his due. "You're going to live in the old house?"

"I think so. If the roof doesn't leak too badly."

"It probably leaks." Tenchi's face was very serious. "Nobody's lived there since before I was born. But Grandfather knows how to fix things. He fixed the step that was wobbly on the path to the cave."

"There's a cave?"

Tenchi's expression changed—a flicker of something that might have been fear or might have been fascination. "We don't go there. It's where the demon sleeps."

Before Sheldon could ask what that meant, Katsuhito's voice came from behind them.

"Tenchi. That's enough about the cave."

The boy's mouth snapped shut. He nodded once, sharply, and looked up at Sheldon with eyes that held a secret he'd been told not to share.

"Dinner will be ready soon," Katsuhito continued, his tone light but with an edge beneath it. "Tenchi, why don't you show Tsukino-san where he can rest his things? The guest room will do for tonight."

Tenchi took Sheldon's hand again, apparently deciding that hand-holding was now their established method of transportation. "Come on," he said. "The guest room is nice. It has a window that looks at the tree."

He led Sheldon toward the main building, small feet pattering on the stone path, and Sheldon followed.

Behind them, the tree watched in silence.
