### Part 4: Scenes 151-200

**POV:** Sheldon (exclusive)  
**Timeline:** 15:54:22 JST — 17:15:00 JST  
**Coverage:** First Contact with Katsuhito → Conversation → Offer of Shelter

---

## SCENE 151
**Time:** 15:54:39 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, initial contact

The old man's gaze carried weight.

Not the casual assessment of a stranger noticing another stranger. Something more directed. More specific. As if he were cataloguing details, comparing what he saw against some internal reference.

He'd been expected, perhaps. Or someone had been expected. And now that someone had arrived.

---

## SCENE 152
**Time:** 15:54:56 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, facing Katsuhito

The distance between them was perhaps thirty meters.

Too far for quiet conversation, too close for formal introduction. An awkward interval that someone would need to bridge. He waited, uncertain whether approaching or remaining still was the proper protocol.

The old man made the decision for him.

---

## SCENE 153
**Time:** 15:55:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, Katsuhito approaching

Katsuhito walked toward him with that same deliberate pace.

Each step measured. Each movement considered. He didn't hurry despite the obvious interest in his expression—the slight forward tilt of his head, the attention fixed without wavering.

Twenty meters. Fifteen. Ten.

---

## SCENE 154
**Time:** 15:55:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, Katsuhito close

The old man stopped at conversational distance.

Perhaps two meters separated them—close enough to speak without raising voices, far enough to maintain personal boundaries. The positioning felt deliberate, like everything else about this man.

Up close, Katsuhito's age showed in his face but not in his eyes. The eyes were sharp. Alert. Younger than the skin that surrounded them.

---

## SCENE 155
**Time:** 15:55:47 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, facing each other

Neither spoke for a long moment.

The shrine silence held—wind chimes, distant birds, the soft shush of breeze through cedar branches. Two men measuring each other across a boundary neither could name.

Then Katsuhito smiled.

---

## SCENE 156
**Time:** 15:56:04 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, facing each other

The smile transformed his face.

Lines deepened around his eyes, pulling the skin into patterns of long-practiced amusement. Whatever gravity had weighted his initial assessment lifted, replaced by something warmer. More welcoming.

"You've come a long way," Katsuhito said.

The words were Japanese. The voice was gentle. The observation carried layers he couldn't immediately parse.

---

## SCENE 157
**Time:** 15:56:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, initial conversation

"I... yes," he managed. "I think so."

The words felt inadequate. He'd come an immeasurable distance—from death to life, from one century to another, from the person he'd been to whatever he was becoming. "A long way" captured none of it.

But it was true nonetheless.

---

## SCENE 158
**Time:** 15:56:38 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, initial conversation

"This is Masaki Shrine," Katsuhito continued, gesturing broadly at the grounds surrounding them. "I am Masaki Katsuhito. I tend to the shrine and to those who come seeking its shelter."

A formal introduction. Name, role, purpose. The structure of politeness that allowed strangers to become known to each other.

---

## SCENE 159
**Time:** 15:56:55 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, introducing himself

He bowed—the automatic response to formality, the movement coming without thought.

"My name is Sheldon. Tsukino Sheldon." The unfamiliar name felt strange on his tongue. "I believe I have... family connections to this area."

Not a lie. The documents in his wallet made the claim. Whether it was true was another matter.

---

## SCENE 160
**Time:** 15:57:12 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

Katsuhito's expression shifted slightly.

Recognition? Confirmation? Something moved behind those intelligent eyes—a piece of information finding its place in a larger pattern.

"Tsukino," he repeated. "Yes. The house near the shrine. It's been waiting."

Waiting. A strange word choice. Houses didn't wait. They stood empty or occupied. But "waiting" suggested anticipation. Purpose.

---

## SCENE 161
**Time:** 15:57:29 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

"You know of it?" he asked.

"Everyone here knows it." Katsuhito's smile hadn't faded. "The Tsukino family has been part of this mountain for generations. The house remembers, even when it stands empty."

More strange language. Houses remembering. Mountains having parts. This man spoke in riddles, or in poetry, or in something between.

---

## SCENE 162
**Time:** 15:57:46 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

"I came on the bus," he said, uncertain why the detail mattered. "A woman—Yamamoto Haruko—asked me to give you her regards."

Katsuhito's smile deepened. "Haruko-san. A good woman. She would have recognized your mother in your face."

My mother. He had a mother in this constructed history. A woman named Yuki who had died in 1985.

---

## SCENE 163
**Time:** 15:58:03 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

"Did you know her?" The question emerged before he could stop it. "My mother?"

"I knew her." Katsuhito's voice gentled further. "She prayed at this shrine every week until she could no longer climb the steps. She was... a bright presence. The mountain misses her."

The mountain misses her. Yamamoto Haruko had said something similar. The mountain doesn't keep secrets. These people spoke of the mountain as if it were alive.

---

## SCENE 164
**Time:** 15:58:20 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

"I don't remember her well," he said carefully. "I've been away for a long time."

Not a lie, exactly. He had no memories of Tsukino Yuki because he hadn't been Tsukino Sheldon until this morning. But the statement was true in the sense that mattered to this conversation.

---

## SCENE 165
**Time:** 15:58:37 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

Katsuhito studied him again.

The assessment was gentler now, less searching. Whatever he'd been looking for, he seemed to have found it—or decided it could wait for later discovery.

"You look tired," he said. "And you've climbed three hundred and twenty steps to reach a place you don't remember. That takes either courage or desperation."

---

## SCENE 166
**Time:** 15:58:54 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, conversation continues

Three hundred and twenty steps. The exact number. Either Katsuhito knew his shrine perfectly, or he'd counted the same steps himself so many times the number had become automatic.

"Somewhere between," he admitted. "I'm not sure which."

"Most honest answers lie somewhere between," Katsuhito replied. "Come. You'll want tea before you see the house."

---

## SCENE 167
**Time:** 15:59:11 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, following Katsuhito

The old man turned and walked toward the main building.

He followed, his longer legs having to shorten their stride to avoid overtaking his guide. The path beneath their feet was raked gravel, maintaining the precise patterns he'd noticed from the torii gate.

Everything here was maintained. Cared for. Loved, perhaps.

---

## SCENE 168
**Time:** 15:59:28 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, walking to main building

"The shrine has stood here for seven hundred years," Katsuhito said without turning. "Give or take a century. The buildings have been rebuilt many times, but the mountain remains the same. The tree remains the same."

The tree. He looked up, scanning the forest edge.

There—beyond the main building. A massive trunk rising above the surrounding cedars. Old. Impossibly old.

---

## SCENE 169
**Time:** 15:59:45 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, walking to main building

"That tree has been here longer than the shrine," Katsuhito continued. "Longer than records. It was old when the first priests came to this mountain."

The tree drew his attention with unexpected force. Something about its presence, its scale, pulled at his perception in ways he couldn't explain.

He looked away with effort.

---

## SCENE 170
**Time:** 16:00:02 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, entrance

They reached the main building.

Katsuhito climbed the wooden steps to the elevated platform, his movements practiced and fluid. He paused at the door, sliding it open with one hand.

"Please. Enter."

---

## SCENE 171
**Time:** 16:00:19 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, entrance

He removed his shoes at the threshold.

The movement was automatic—Japanese courtesy internalized years ago during his Kyoto summers. Shoes placed together, facing outward, ready for departure. The floor inside was polished wood, warm beneath his socked feet.

---

## SCENE 172
**Time:** 16:00:36 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, interior

The interior smelled of incense and age.

Sandalwood, he identified. And something earthier beneath—the particular scent of old wood, maintained for centuries, absorbing the prayers and offerings of countless visitors. The space was larger than it appeared from outside, expanding into shadow and silence.

---

## SCENE 173
**Time:** 16:00:53 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, interior

Katsuhito led him through the public space to a smaller room beyond.

Here the atmosphere shifted from sacred to domestic. A low table occupied the center of the tatami floor. Cushions were stacked in one corner. A kettle sat on a small gas burner, steam already rising from its spout.

He'd been expected. The water was already hot.

---

## SCENE 174
**Time:** 16:01:10 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Please sit," Katsuhito said, gesturing to one of the cushions.

He lowered himself to the floor, his knees protesting briefly before settling into the unfamiliar position. Seiza. Formal kneeling. His body remembered the posture even if his recent life hadn't required it.

---

## SCENE 175
**Time:** 16:01:27 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

Katsuhito prepared tea with practiced efficiency.

No wasted movements. Each gesture serving a purpose. He measured leaves, poured water, allowed time for steeping. The ritual had its own rhythm, its own patience.

Neither of them spoke during the preparation. The silence felt appropriate.

---

## SCENE 176
**Time:** 16:02:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

A cup appeared before him on the table.

Simple ceramic, gray-green glaze, the kind of everyday vessel that accumulated character over decades of use. Steam rose from the tea inside—hojicha, he identified from the smell. Roasted green tea.

"Thank you." He lifted the cup carefully, both hands wrapped around its warmth.

---

## SCENE 177
**Time:** 16:03:01 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The first sip burned slightly.

Not unpleasantly—the particular warmth that spreading through the chest, settling somewhere between comfort and alert. The roasted notes of the tea were strong, nutty, grounding in a way that felt deliberate.

Katsuhito had chosen this tea for a reason.

---

## SCENE 178
**Time:** 16:03:18 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"You've traveled far today," Katsuhito said, settling across the table with his own cup. "Not just in distance."

The observation hung in the air between them.

He set down his tea. "You can tell?"

"The mountain accepted you." Katsuhito's smile returned. "It doesn't accept everyone who climbs its steps. You arrived because you were meant to arrive."

---

## SCENE 179
**Time:** 16:03:35 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"I don't understand what that means."

The admission felt dangerous. Showing ignorance to a stranger. But lies required energy he didn't have, and this old man seemed to see through surfaces anyway.

"Neither do I, fully." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "Understanding takes time. What matters today is that you've arrived."

---

## SCENE 180
**Time:** 16:03:52 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"The Tsukino house," he said, redirecting to concrete matters. "Is it... habitable?"

"It's been maintained. The roof doesn't leak. The tatami was replaced last year. The well still produces good water." Katsuhito set down his cup. "It's a home waiting for someone to live in it."

---

## SCENE 181
**Time:** 16:04:09 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

A home waiting.

The concept settled into him with unexpected weight. He owned property. He had somewhere to go. Whatever else remained uncertain, he wouldn't be sleeping in a field tonight.

"I have the deed," he said. "In my wallet. If you need to verify—"

Katsuhito waved the offer away. "I know who you are, Tsukino Sheldon. Papers are formalities."

---

## SCENE 182
**Time:** 16:04:26 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"You knew I was coming."

Not a question. The hot water, the second cushion already in position, Katsuhito's lack of surprise at finding a foreigner at his shrine. The signs had been obvious from the start.

"I knew someone was coming." Katsuhito's eyes held something unreadable. "Whether it would be you... that remained to be seen."

---

## SCENE 183
**Time:** 16:04:43 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"How did you know?"

"The mountain told me." Said simply, without drama, as if mountains routinely communicated with their residents. "Three days ago, I felt the change. Something was arriving. Something important."

He should have dismissed this as mysticism. Superstition. An old man's fantasy. But he'd died and been resurrected in a field. His capacity for dismissal had limits.

---

## SCENE 184
**Time:** 16:05:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"I don't understand what's happening to me," he said quietly.

The admission cost something—professional pride, perhaps, or the illusion of control he'd been maintaining since waking. But truth seemed appropriate here, in this room that smelled of incense and acceptance.

---

## SCENE 185
**Time:** 16:05:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

Katsuhito nodded slowly.

"Understanding takes time," he repeated. "For now, you need food and rest. The house is a fifteen-minute walk from here. I can show you the way when you're ready."

Practical concerns. Immediate needs. The old man was offering shelter without demanding explanation.

---

## SCENE 186
**Time:** 16:05:34 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Why would you help me?" The question emerged raw. "You don't know me. You have no reason to—"

"The shrine helps those who need help." Katsuhito's voice carried gentle correction. "This is what shrines are for. Not just prayers and offerings. Shelter. Welcome. Community."

---

## SCENE 187
**Time:** 16:05:51 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"I'm a stranger."

"You're Yuki-san's son." The counter came immediately. "You're the owner of the Tsukino house. You climbed three hundred and twenty steps and the mountain let you reach the top. In what sense are you a stranger?"

---

## SCENE 188
**Time:** 16:06:08 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

He had no answer for that.

The logic was circular but somehow complete. He belonged here because he was here. He was welcome because someone had placed him where welcome existed. The constructed identity carried weight that felt genuine despite its origins.

He finished his tea.

---

## SCENE 189
**Time:** 16:06:25 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"There's one more thing," Katsuhito said, rising to refill the kettle. "My grandson lives here with me. Tenchi. He's four years old. He'll want to meet you."

A child. He hadn't considered the presence of children.

"I'll try not to frighten him." The words came out slightly awkward.

---

## SCENE 190
**Time:** 16:06:42 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

Katsuhito's laugh was sudden and genuine.

"Tenchi has never been frightened of anything in his life. Cautious sometimes. Curious always. But frightened? No." He set the kettle back on the burner. "He'll be home from school soon. You'll see."

---

## SCENE 191
**Time:** 16:06:59 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

He accepted a second cup of tea.

The warmth spread through him again, different this time. Less about temperature, more about something else. Acceptance, maybe. Or the simple relief of being somewhere safe after a day of constant uncertainty.

---

## SCENE 192
**Time:** 16:08:16 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

They sat in companionable silence.

Katsuhito seemed comfortable with the quiet, neither rushing to fill it nor waiting expectantly for conversation. A man used to solitude, perhaps. Or used to company that didn't require constant verbal connection.

The wind chimes sounded outside. Birds called. The kettle whispered steam.

---

## SCENE 193
**Time:** 16:12:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Tell me about yourself," Katsuhito said eventually. "Not your history—I know enough of that. Tell me about who you are."

The question was impossible to answer.

Who was he? Sheldon Carter, dead physicist? Tsukino Sheldon, returned heir? Something between, neither fully one nor the other?

---

## SCENE 194
**Time:** 16:12:50 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"I'm a scientist," he said, choosing the safest identity. "Theoretical physics. I study... I studied how things work at the fundamental level."

"Ah." Katsuhito's interest seemed genuine. "The deep structure of reality. You look for patterns beneath patterns."

---

## SCENE 195
**Time:** 16:13:07 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Something like that." The description was more accurate than he'd expected from a shrine keeper.

"Then you'll appreciate the shrine's work," Katsuhito said. "We also look for patterns. Different tools, perhaps, but similar questions. Why does the world work as it does? What connects the visible to the invisible?"

---

## SCENE 196
**Time:** 16:13:24 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The comparison was flattering but probably wrong.

Physics dealt with measurement, mathematics, reproducible results. Shrines dealt with tradition, ritual, faith. The methods couldn't be more different.

But he was in no position to argue. His own existence currently defied every measurement he knew.

---

## SCENE 197
**Time:** 16:15:41 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

A sound from outside. Running footsteps on the wooden platform.

"Ojii-chan!" A child's voice, bright and carrying. "Ojii-chan, I'm home!"

Katsuhito's face transformed—the measured calm giving way to undisguised affection. The expression of a grandfather hearing his grandchild's return.

---

## SCENE 198
**Time:** 16:15:58 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The door slid open.

A small figure stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the afternoon light. Short black hair, slightly messy. School uniform—navy shorts, white shirt, the yellow cap of a local kindergarten clutched in one hand.

Brown eyes, wide and curious, fixed on the stranger sitting across from his grandfather.

---

## SCENE 199
**Time:** 16:16:15 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Ojii-chan," the boy said, quieter now. "Who's that?"

The question carried no fear. Only interest. A child encountering something new and wanting to understand it.

Katsuhito smiled at the boy, then at him.

"Tenchi, this is Tsukino Sheldon. He's come home to live in the house near the shrine."

---

## SCENE 200
**Time:** 16:16:32 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The boy—Tenchi—stepped fully into the room.

Small. Serious expression despite his age. He studied Sheldon with the frank directness children possessed before society taught them to look away.

"Hello," Tenchi said formally. "Welcome home."

The words were clearly rehearsed—a greeting taught for visitors—but they landed with unexpected force.

Welcome home.

From a four-year-old boy who didn't know what those words could mean.
