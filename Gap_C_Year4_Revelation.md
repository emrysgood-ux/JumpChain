# GAP C: YEAR 4 (1992) — THE REVELATION
## Son of Cosmos: The Truth Between Them

---

# OVERVIEW

**Year:** 4 (April 1992 - March 1993)
**Tenchi's Age:** 7→8
**Phase:** Transition from Phase I to Phase II
**Significance:** The defining moment of Sheldon and Yosho's relationship

This is when Sheldon stops being a guest with secrets and becomes Yosho's genuine partner. The revelation transforms their dynamic from "employer/employee with mutual fondness" to "two men with impossible histories who understand each other."

# THE TRIGGER

## The Incident: Autumn 1992

**Setting:** Late evening, shrine grounds, power outage during autumn storm

**What Happens:**
Tenchi (age 8) is visiting for the weekend. A typhoon knocks out power to the shrine. Sheldon goes to check on Tenchi in the guest room. Complete darkness — no moon, no stars, thick cloud cover.

Sheldon navigates perfectly. Opens the door, walks directly to Tenchi's futon, adjusts his blanket, whispers reassurance. Doesn't bump anything. Doesn't hesitate.

Yosho watches from the hallway. Says nothing that night.

**The Next Morning:**
Yosho invites Sheldon for tea. His first question:

> "The power went out at 2:47 AM. You reached Tenchi's room in forty-three seconds. You did not use a light. You did not stumble. The hallway has three loose boards you step around automatically during the day. Last night, in complete darkness, you avoided all three."

Sheldon freezes.

> "I have watched you for three years, Sheldon-san. Your reflexes are faster than they should be. Your hands never burn when cooking. You hear conversations from rooms away. And last night, you saw in the dark."

---

# THE CONVERSATION

## Setting: Yosho's Private Room

**Time:** Morning, after breakfast, Tenchi sent to play
**Atmosphere:** Rain still falling, gray light, tea between them

## Yosho's Opening

> "I am not accusing you of anything. I am asking you to trust me with the truth. Whatever it is."

He pauses.

> "I have lived a very long time, Sheldon-san. I have seen things that would strain credulity. Nothing you tell me will make me think less of you. But I cannot continue to pretend I do not notice."

## Sheldon's Decision

Internal: *Three years of building trust. Three years of lies by omission. If I tell him and he thinks I'm insane, I lose everything. If I don't tell him, I'm betraying the only real friendship I've had since... since before.*

He sets down his tea.

> "What I'm about to tell you will sound impossible. I don't have proof. I can only tell you the truth and hope you believe me."

## The Truth (What Sheldon Reveals)

**In order:**

1. **His death:** "I died. October 23rd, 2025. I was thirty-eight years old. A particle accelerator accident at the University of Alaska Fairbanks."

2. **His previous life:** "I was a physicist. Four doctorates. I spent my whole life in laboratories and classrooms. I never married. My parents died when I was ten. My grandmother raised me until she died when I was twenty-two. I was alone for most of my adult life."

3. **The resurrection:** "Something — someone — brought me back. I woke up in that field outside the village. This body. These abilities. A new identity. A family that's real but that I never lived with."

4. **What he doesn't understand:** "I don't know why I was chosen. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I only know that I was put here, and that caring for your family feels more right than anything I've ever done."

5. **The presence:** "Sometimes I feel... watched. Protected. Like something vast is aware of me. In dreams, there's a presence. A woman, I think. Silver light. She's never spoken clearly, but I feel her... approval. When I'm with Tenchi. When I'm... here."

## What Sheldon Does NOT Say

- The name "Cosmos" (he doesn't know it yet)
- That he suspects this might be an anime universe (memory fog prevents clear recall)
- Specific details about his powers' source
- Anything that would identify Sailor Moon/Cosmos connection

---

# YOSHO'S RESPONSE

## The Silence

Yosho listens without interrupting. When Sheldon finishes, he's quiet for a long time. The rain falls. The tea grows cold.

Then:

> "Thank you for trusting me."

## The Reveal (Partial)

Yosho stands. Moves to the window. His back to Sheldon.

> "You are not the only one with an impossible story."

He turns. And for the first time, Sheldon sees it — a flicker. The elderly priest's posture shifts. Something in his eyes changes. For just a moment, Sheldon glimpses someone else. Someone younger. Someone... ancient.

> "My name is Yosho. I am over seven hundred years old. I came to this planet from a world called Jurai, pursuing a demon I had defeated but could not kill. I have worn this form for so long that most days I forget what my true face looks like."

He doesn't show his true form — not yet. But he admits it exists.

> "The demon sleeps in a cave not far from here. I am her jailer. Tenchi is my grandson — truly my grandson, not a fiction — and he carries power he does not yet understand. I have been waiting to see if he would need it."

## What Yosho Reveals

1. **His Juraian origin** — alien prince, exiled/fled, centuries old
2. **The sealed enemy** — Ryoko, sleeping in the cave, Tenchi's destiny to awaken her
3. **Tenchi's heritage** — royal blood, potential power, deliberate ignorance
4. **The waiting** — Yosho has been watching, preparing, protecting

## What Yosho Does NOT Reveal (Yet)

- Details about Jurai's politics
- The full nature of Light Hawk Wings
- Tsunami, Washu, the goddesses
- The extent of what's coming
- His relationship to the sealed gems

## The Bond

> "So. You are a dead man given new life by a silver goddess. I am an exiled prince pretending to be a country priest. We are both protecting a boy who doesn't know what he is."

Sheldon:

> "When you put it that way..."

> "We are a strange family, Sheldon-san. But we are family."

# IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH

## The Days Following

**Changed Dynamic:**
- No more careful avoidance of certain topics
- Yosho speaks more freely about "the old days" (vague, but present)
- Sheldon can ask questions without pretending ignorance
- Physical proximity becomes easier — the secrecy barrier removed

**What Doesn't Change:**
- Daily routine remains the same
- Tenchi notices nothing different
- Village sees no change
- The careful protection continues

## Training Begins

**Week One:**
Yosho asks to see Sheldon's abilities in controlled circumstances. Tests:
- Night vision range and clarity
- Hearing sensitivity
- Reflex speed
- Temperature tolerance
- Physical recovery rate

**His Assessment:**

> "You are not superhuman. You are... optimized. Every capacity a human could theoretically achieve, you have. But nothing beyond. Whoever made you was careful."

**Week Two:**
Basic meditation techniques. Yosho teaches Sheldon to *feel* his own energy, to recognize when abilities are active versus passive.

> "Control begins with awareness. You cannot master what you cannot perceive."

**Month One:**
Introduction to Juraian breathing exercises. Not the full combat techniques — Sheldon isn't built for that — but the foundational awareness practices that underlie them.

**Ongoing:**
Morning meditation becomes joint practice. Sheldon learns to quiet his mind, to sense the energy flows around the shrine. He begins to perceive things he couldn't before: the pulse of the land, the watchfulness of the trees, the... disturbance... near the lake.

# RELATIONSHIP EVOLUTION

## Before the Revelation

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Trust Level | High but incomplete |
| Physical Contact | Rare, formal |
| Emotional Sharing | Surface only |
| Evening Conversations | Light topics |
| Secrets | Many, on both sides |

## After the Revelation

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Trust Level | Complete, mutual |
| Physical Contact | Easier, more natural |
| Emotional Sharing | Deeper, honest |
| Evening Conversations | Real discussions |
| Secrets | Few, and acknowledged |

## The Shift

The revelation doesn't immediately become romantic. It becomes *intimate* — in the older sense of that word. Two people who genuinely know each other. Who don't have to perform.

Yosho begins to talk about his wife (Tenchi's grandmother). About losing her. About the centuries of solitude before and after.

Sheldon talks about his parents. His grandmother Dorothy Mae. The decades of substituting work for connection.

They recognize each other: two lonely men who'd stopped expecting to be understood.

# COSMOS'S RESPONSE

## The Dream (December 1992)

Sheldon's clearest contact with Cosmos to date:

**Setting:** Silver void, warmth, presence

**What He Perceives:**
- Approval, strong and clear
- Something like maternal pride
- The sense of *"yes, this is right"*
- A feeling that telling Yosho was part of the plan

**What She Communicates (Emotional, Not Verbal):**
- *You chose correctly*
- *He can be trusted*
- *The bond you're building matters*
- *This is what I hoped for*

**What She Does NOT Reveal:**
- Her identity
- The full plan
- Why Yosho specifically

Sheldon wakes feeling lighter than he has in years.
