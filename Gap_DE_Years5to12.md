**Tenchi's Age:** 8→16
**Phase:** Phase II (Post-Revelation, Training Era)

# YEAR 5 (1993): POST-REVELATION ADJUSTMENT

## Context

Year 4 ended with the Revelation. Sheldon and Yosho now share their truths. Year 5 is about integrating this new reality.

**Tenchi's Age:** 8→9
**School Level:** Elementary 3rd Grade

## The New Dynamic

**Morning Meditation (Joint):**
Established in Year 4, now routine. Sheldon and Yosho meditate together at dawn.

For Sheldon: Learning to perceive his own Lambda energy
For Yosho: Teaching awareness, watching Sheldon's progress

**Training Sessions:**
Twice weekly, early morning. Yosho tests Sheldon's capabilities:
- Sensory exercises (hearing, sight, touch)
- Physical drills (reflexes, endurance)
- Energy perception practice

Sheldon is not becoming a warrior. He's learning to understand himself.

**Evening Conversations:**
No longer surface-level. Yosho talks about Jurai. About his wife. About centuries of exile.

Sheldon talks about his previous life. About his grandmother. About what he lost.

They understand each other.

## Key Events

**Spring:**
- Training routine established
- Tenchi notices Sheldon and grandfather spending more time together
- Village stable, routine comfortable

**Summer:**
- First time Yosho shows Sheldon the cave entrance (not the interior)
- "She sleeps there. Has for seven hundred years."
- Sheldon feels the wrongness. The watching presence.

**Autumn:**
- Tenchi asks about Yosho's past for the first time
- "Grandfather, why do you never talk about when you were young?"
- Yosho deflects. Sheldon watches carefully.

**Winter:**
- Cosmos dream: Clearer communication. The word "son" conveyed.
- Sheldon understands: Whatever she is, she considers him hers.

# YEAR 6 (1994): TENCHI'S QUESTION

## Context

**Tenchi's Age:** 9→10
**School Level:** Elementary 4th Grade

This is the year Tenchi starts asking real questions.

## The Grandfather Question

**The Moment (Autumn 1994):**
Tenchi, age 10, studying for school. History unit on aging.

He asks Sheldon:
> "Why doesn't Grandfather look older in old pictures?"

Sheldon freezes. He's seen the pictures too. Yosho in photos from thirty years ago looks... the same.

> "What do you mean?"

> "The pictures in the study. Grandfather with Father when Father was little. Grandfather looks the same as now."

Sheldon: "Ask your grandfather."

Tenchi does. Yosho gives a non-answer about "good genes." Tenchi accepts it. For now.

But Sheldon and Yosho discuss it that night:
> "He's starting to notice."
> "He has eyes. Eventually he will see."
> "What will you tell him?"
> "The truth. When he's ready."

## The Tokyo Offer

**Context:**
Nobuyuki's company offers him a promotion. It would require moving to Tokyo. He would take Tenchi.

**The Conversation:**
Nobuyuki asks Tenchi (age 10):
> "Would you like to live in Tokyo? Big city, lots to do, better schools..."

Tenchi's response (immediate):
> "No. I want to stay here."

> "But—"

> "This is home. Grandfather is here. Sheldon is here. I'm not leaving."

**Aftermath:**
Nobuyuki turns down the promotion. Tells Yosho:
> "He's happier here than I've ever seen him. I won't take that away."

**Sheldon's Realization:**
Tenchi chose them. Chose this life. This isn't obligation anymore — it's choice.

# YEAR 7 (1995): THE MOTHER QUESTION

## Context

**Tenchi's Age:** 10→11
**School Level:** Elementary 5th Grade
**Historical Note:** Great Hanshin Earthquake (January 17, 1995); Aum Shinrikyo attacks (March 20)

## Tenchi Asks About His Mother

**The Moment (Spring 1995):**
School assignment: Family tree. Tenchi has to draw his family and write about them.

He comes to Sheldon:
> "I don't know anything about my mother."

**The Problem:**
Kiyone Masaki died when Tenchi was young (approximately 2 years old). Tenchi has no memories. Nobuyuki doesn't talk about her. Yosho... also doesn't talk about her.

**Sheldon's Navigation:**
He doesn't know the full story either. But he helps Tenchi:
- Suggests asking Nobuyuki directly
- Offers to be there for support
- Doesn't pretend to have answers he doesn't have

**Nobuyuki's Response:**
Painful. Brief. But honest:
> "Your mother was wonderful. She died when you were two. It still hurts to talk about. But I'll try."

He shows Tenchi photographs. Tells stories. Cries.

Tenchi learns his mother's face. Her name. That she loved him.

**Yosho's Private Grief:**
Kiyone was his daughter-in-law, but also... more complicated (Juraian bloodlines, Tenchi's inheritance). He grieves quietly. Sheldon notices. Says nothing. Just makes sure Yosho eats dinner that week.

## Historical Context Impact

**Hanshin Earthquake (January 1995):**
- 6,400+ deaths in Kobe area
- National trauma
- Sheldon helps organize shrine donations/support
- Tenchi asks: "Why do bad things happen?"
- Sheldon: "I don't know. But we help when we can."

**Aum Attacks (March 1995):**
- Sarin gas attack on Tokyo subway
- 13 deaths, thousands injured
- National horror
- Rural Okayama feels far away but connected
- Conversations about evil, about safety, about trust

# YEAR 8 (1996): PRE-ADOLESCENCE

## Context

**Tenchi's Age:** 11→12
**School Level:** Elementary 6th Grade (Final Year)

## Changes Begin

Tenchi at 11-12:
- Growth spurt beginning
- Voice starting to change
- More private, more independent
- Less physically affectionate (normal development)
- Still fundamentally the same good kid

**Sheldon's Adjustment:**
The little boy who sat in his lap is becoming a young man who needs space.

Sheldon gives space. Makes sure Tenchi knows he's there, but doesn't hover.

## The Independence Test

**The Moment:**
Tenchi wants to walk to town alone. It's 40 minutes each way.

Old response: "Let me come with you."
New response: "Be back by dinner."

Tenchi goes. Comes back. Proud.

Sheldon was tracking him by sound the whole time. Tenchi doesn't need to know that.

## Elementary School Graduation (March 1996)

**The Ceremony:**
Tenchi graduates elementary school. Speeches. Certificates. Photos.

Present: Yosho, Nobuyuki, Sheldon.

Sheldon watches from the "family friends" section. Tenchi waves at him during the recessional.

**After:**
Tenchi hugs each of them. Holds onto Sheldon longest.

> "Thank you for being here."
> "Always."

# YEARS 9-11 (1997-2000): MIDDLE SCHOOL

## Year 9 (1997): New World

**Tenchi's Age:** 12→13
**School Level:** Middle School 1st Year

**The Transition:**
Middle school is different:
- Different building
- Different students
- Harder academics
- Club activities
- More independence

Tenchi commutes to town daily now. He's home less. Growing up.

**Sheldon's Role Shifts:**
Less caretaker, more... background support.
- Makes sure food is ready
- Available for homework help
- Doesn't pry
- Trusts the foundation they built

**The Growing Apart (Normal):**
Tenchi talks less about his day. Has friends his own age. Develops interests Sheldon doesn't share.

This is healthy. This is right. It still hurts a little.

## Year 10 (1998): Questions Resurface

**Tenchi's Age:** 13→14
**School Level:** Middle School 2nd Year

**The Grandfather Question Returns:**

Tenchi, now 14, thinking more critically:
> "Sheldon. Can I ask you something?"
> "Always."
> "Grandfather isn't normal, is he?"

Sheldon carefully:
> "What do you mean?"

> "I've thought about it for years. He doesn't age. He knows things he shouldn't. Sometimes he moves wrong — like he's pretending to be slower than he is."

Sheldon's response:
> "Your grandfather has secrets. They're his to tell. But I can promise you: he loves you. Everything he does is to protect you."

Tenchi accepts this. For now.

## Year 11 (1999): High School Entrance

**Tenchi's Age:** 14→15
**School Level:** Middle School 3rd Year

**The Focus:** Entrance exams for high school.

Sheldon helps with studying. Math and science especially (he IS a physicist).

**The Result:**
Tenchi is accepted to a good high school in town. Everyone is proud.

**The Feeling:**
Something building. Yosho is more watchful. The lake feels different.

Sheldon doesn't know what's coming, but feels the anticipation in the air.

# YEAR 12 (2000): THE LAST NORMAL YEAR

## Context

**Tenchi's Age:** 15→16
**School Level:** High School 1st Year
**Historical Note:** Y2K transition, new millennium

## The Final Year of Peace

No one knows it, but this is the last year before everything changes.

**Tenchi at 15-16:**
- Settled into high school
- Has friends, interests, a normal life
- Still comes home to the shrine
- Still loves his family
- Starting to notice girls (normal teenage stuff)

**The Household:**
- Yosho seems watchful, pensive
- Sheldon has been here 12 years now
- Routines are deep, comfortable, automatic
- Something feels... pending

## The Cave

**Tenchi's Interest:**
He's always wondered about the cave. The one Yosho told him never to enter.

At 15, curiosity grows. He starts asking questions.
> "Why can't I go there?"
> "What's inside?"
> "Is it dangerous?"

Yosho's responses are vague. Firm. Increasingly concerned.

**Sheldon's Warning:**
To Yosho:
> "He's going to go eventually. Teenagers don't stay forbidden."

Yosho:
> "I know. I've been preparing for seven hundred years. I'm still not ready."

## The Training Intensifies

**For Tenchi:**
Yosho increases kendo training. Pushes harder. Explains less.

Tenchi notices:
> "Grandfather's been different lately."
> "Different how?"
> "More serious. Like he's waiting for something."

**For Sheldon:**
Their training sessions shift. Less about capability, more about control. Yosho teaches Sheldon to suppress his energy signature.

> "When things begin, you may need to hide what you are."
> "From who?"
> "From everyone who might ask questions."

## New Year 2000-2001

**Millennium Celebration:**

The world celebrates Y2K. The shrine is quiet.

Tenchi: "The new millennium! Isn't it exciting?"
Yosho: "I've seen centuries turn before. The world continues."

But Sheldon notices:
Yosho is afraid. Not of the millennium. Of what comes after.

# SHELDON-YOSHO RELATIONSHIP: YEARS 5-12

## The Progression

**Year 5:** Adjustment to shared truth. Training begins.
**Year 6:** Deep friendship solidified. Evening conversations routine.
**Year 7:** Comfort with silence. Can be together without speaking.
**Year 8:** Physical proximity increases. Small touches acceptable.
**Year 9:** Something more than friendship acknowledged (unspoken).
**Year 10:** First moment of genuine romantic tension. Neither acts.
**Year 11:** The feeling is undeniable. Still waiting.
**Year 12:** Both know. Neither says. There's time.

## Key Moments

**Year 6: The First Touch**
Yosho places a hand on Sheldon's shoulder. Lets it rest. Longer than necessary.

**Year 8: The Night Watch**
Sheldon falls asleep reading. Yosho covers him with a blanket. Watches him sleep for a moment before leaving.

**Year 10: The Almost**
Evening conversation goes late. They're close. It would be so easy.

Neither moves. The time isn't right. But both know it's coming.

## Why They Wait

**Yosho:**
- 700 years old
- Has lost everyone he's loved
- Afraid to risk this friendship
- Watching to see if Sheldon will stay

**Sheldon:**
- Uncertain of his right to want this
- Doesn't want to presume
- Building something carefully
- Waiting for Yosho to be ready

**The Understanding:**
Somewhere in Year 10 or 11, they both know. The waiting becomes intentional. Not avoidance — anticipation.

They're building something that will last centuries. They can take their time.
