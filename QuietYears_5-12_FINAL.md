# PART 1: YEAR 5 (1993-1994)
## "Truth Shared"

### 1.1 — The Context

Year 5 opens with Sheldon and Yosho in new dynamic:
- Training established (10 months since Year 4 revelation)
- Sheldon can be himself around Yosho
- But still hiding from Tenchi

**The Problem:** Sheldon just freed himself from deception with Yosho. Now he's maintaining the same deception with the child he's raising.

### 1.2 — The Tenchi Revelation (Early Summer 1993)

**Trigger:** Tenchi catches Sheldon in the dark kitchen, clearly able to see.

**Sheldon's Choice:** Instead of lying, he tells the truth.

> "I can see in the dark, Tenchi."

**The Conversation:**
- Age-appropriate truth (not full cosmic details)
- "Something happened to me before I came here"
- "I can do things other people can't"
- "Grandpa knows and helps me train"
- "This is a secret from Dad"

**Tenchi's Response:**
> "I'm glad you told me. I don't like secrets."

*(Full details in Year5_Tenchi_Revelation.md)*

### 1.3 — Post-Revelation Dynamic

**What Changes:**
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Sheldon hides abilities from Tenchi | Relaxed at home |
| Training hidden | Tenchi can observe sometimes |
| Two-tier household | United (except Nobuyuki) |
| Sheldon guarded | Sheldon honest |

**Tenchi's New Role:**
- Secret-keeper (from Dad, village)
- Observer of training (not participant yet)
- Full family member with full trust

### 1.4 — Training Focus: Year 5

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Meditation | Deepening breath work |
| Sensory | Learning to "dial down" enhanced hearing |
| Physical | Basic forms; body awareness |
| Mental | Processing his nature |

### 1.5 — Historical Context

- Jurassic Park in theaters
- Windows 3.1 era
- Japan's bubble economy aftermath
- Bill Clinton's first year

---

# PART 2: YEAR 6 (1994-1995)
## "Choices"

### 2.1 — Tenchi's Big Decision

**Spring 1994:** Nobuyuki offers Tenchi the chance to live in Tokyo.

> "You could go to a better school. Be closer to me. Have more opportunities."

**Tenchi's Response:** No.

> "This is my home. Grandpa is here. Sheru-ji is here. I don't want to leave."

**Significance:** Tenchi chooses the shrine — and by extension, his found family — over the biological parent and "normal" life.

### 2.2 — Sheldon and Yosho's Role

They don't influence. They don't pressure. When Tenchi tells them his decision, Sheldon simply asks:

> "Are you sure? This is about what you want."

Tenchi is sure.

### 2.3 — Training Focus: Year 6

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Physical | Kendo forms introduced |
| Sensory | Visual focus — controlling night vision |
| Philosophy | First talks about patience, long view |

**Tenchi's Training:** Yosho begins teaching Tenchi sword basics (bokken). Tenchi is 9-10 — old enough to start.

### 2.4 — Relationship Milestone

First time Yosho shares a personal story with Sheldon (carefully edited).

> "I once knew a woman who reminded me of the ocean. That was a long time ago."

Sheldon doesn't push. He listens. Something deepens.

### 2.5 — Historical Context

- Great Hanshin Earthquake (January 17, 1995) — 6,400+ deaths
- Aum Shinrikyo sarin attack (March 20, 1995)
- PlayStation launches in Japan
- National trauma year

**Sheldon's Response:** Quietly donates to relief efforts. Explains tragedy to Tenchi. Japan is shaken.

---

# PART 3: YEAR 7 (1995-1996)
## "Questions"

### 3.1 — Tenchi Asks About His Mother

**Setting:** A quiet evening, early in the year.

**Tenchi:** "Sheru-ji... what was my mom like?"

**The Challenge:** Sheldon never knew Kiyone. But Tenchi is asking HIM, not Katsuhito, not Nobuyuki.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
1. Asks Tenchi what he remembers (almost nothing — he was 4)
2. Suggests they ask Grandpa together
3. Facilitates the conversation rather than answering directly
4. Later: Asks Nobuyuki to share more during visits

**Aftermath:** Over the year, Tenchi learns more about Kiyone through multiple conversations. Sheldon's role is connector, not source.

### 3.2 — Sheldon's Processing

This is the moment Sheldon fully accepts: he's Tenchi's father in function, not replacement for Tenchi's mother.

He can't give Tenchi Kiyone. But he can help Tenchi find her in the memories of others.

### 3.3 — Training Focus: Year 7

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Emotional | Grief surfaces; Sheldon processes loss |
| Physical | Endurance building |
| Philosophy | Long-term perspective |

**Key Session:** A training session where Sheldon's grief about his previous life surfaces unexpectedly. Yosho doesn't dismiss it. They sit with it.

### 3.4 — Relationship Milestone

First emotionally vulnerable conversation beyond the original revelation. The training becomes about more than abilities.

---

# PART 4: YEAR 8 (1996-1997)
## "Last Childhood"

### 4.1 — Final Elementary Year

Tenchi is 11-12. Elementary school ends in March 1997.

**Physical Changes:** Pre-adolescence. Growth spurt beginning. Voice starting to change.

**Emotional Changes:** More independent. Slightly embarrassed by parental attention. Normal.

### 4.2 — Sheldon's Adjustment

The boy who needed constant care is becoming a young man who needs space.

**Sheldon's Response:** Step back. Be available but not hovering. Let Tenchi come to him.

This is hard. Sheldon has been primary caregiver for 8 years. But it's right.

### 4.3 — Training Focus: Year 8

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Physical | Sparring begins; physical trust |
| Endurance | Yosho pushes limits; learns more about Sheldon |
| Recovery | Testing healing rate |

**Yosho's Observation:** Sheldon's healing factor is significant. Not superhuman-obvious. But significant.

### 4.4 — Relationship Milestone

Training includes sparring for the first time. Physical contact that isn't caregiving or combat, but... partnership.

Something shifts.

---

# PART 5: YEAR 9 (1997-1998)
## "Transition"

### 5.1 — Middle School Begins

**Major Change:** Tenchi commutes to town for school. Longer days. Different social world. Less time at shrine.

**Tenchi's Age:** 12-13

**New Reality:**
- Leaves earlier, returns later
- Homework more demanding
- New friends Sheldon doesn't know
- Growing independence (normal, healthy)

### 5.2 — The Growing Apart

Tenchi needs Sheldon less. This is good. This is healthy. This is what parenting is for.

But it creates space.

### 5.3 — Sheldon and Yosho

That space fills with something else.

Evening conversations become ritual, not occasional. Training extends beyond physical. Philosophy, history (carefully edited), questions about life and meaning.

**Yosho's Hints:** He begins dropping references to his own long life.

> "I have seen empires rise and fall."

Sheldon notices. Doesn't push.

### 5.4 — Training Focus: Year 9

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Sensing | Advanced — Sheldon feels the "warmth" of shrine |
| Integration | Abilities becoming natural |
| Philosophy | Deep discussions about time, change |

---

# PART 6: YEAR 10 (1998-1999)
## "Adolescence"

### 6.1 — Full Teenage Years

Tenchi is 13-14. Full adolescence.

**Characteristics:**
- Mood swings (normal)
- Privacy demands (normal)
- Occasional rebellion (normal)
- First crushes probably (not discussed)

### 6.2 — Tenchi's Questions

Tenchi becomes curious about Yosho's past.

> "Grandpa, how old are you really?"

Yosho deflects with humor. Sheldon notes the question but says nothing. Tenchi isn't ready for that answer.

### 6.3 — The Secret's Weight

Tenchi has kept the secret about Sheldon for five years now. He's good at it. But occasionally:

> "Sheru-ji, is there more you haven't told me?"

**Sheldon's Answer:** "Yes. When you're older. I promise."

Tenchi accepts this. He trusts Sheldon to keep that promise.

### 6.4 — Training Focus: Year 10

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Philosophy | Long conversations about patience, purpose |
| Physical | Maintenance; not advancement |
| Mental | Integration complete |

### 6.5 — Relationship Milestone

Evening conversations are now the best part of both Sheldon and Yosho's days. Neither has said this. Both know it.

---

# PART 7: YEAR 11 (1999-2000)
## "Calm Before"

### 7.1 — High School Exams

Tenchi is 14-15. Middle School 3rd Year. High school entrance exams.

**Stress:** Normal academic pressure. Sheldon helps with studying but gives space.

**Outcome:** Tenchi gets into local high school. Will continue commuting.

### 7.2 — The Feeling

Throughout Year 11, both Sheldon and Yosho feel something approaching.

**Yosho:** Increasingly pensive. Watches the lake more. The cave. Something he's been waiting for.

**Sheldon:** Memory fog thinning. Dreams of cyan hair. A name he can't quite grasp.

Neither speaks of it directly. But they both know: the quiet years are ending.

### 7.3 — Training Focus: Year 11

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Integration | Abilities fully natural |
| Preparation | Something coming |
| Partnership | Yosho hints at "what's sealed" |

**Key Moment:** Yosho's first explicit acknowledgment of supernatural elements to Sheldon.

> "There are things beneath this shrine, Sheldon. Things that have slept for a long time. They will not sleep forever."

### 7.4 — Millennium Change

**December 31, 1999:** Y2K concerns. The world doesn't end.

**January 1, 2000:** New millennium. The household celebrates quietly.

**Sheldon's Thought:** *I've been here 11 years. I look exactly the same. Tenchi has grown from 4 to 15. And something is coming.*

---

# PART 8: YEAR 12 (2000-2001)
## "Final Normal"

### 8.1 — High School Begins

**New World:**

- Lake meditation brings Sheldon close to something

### 8.3 — Sheldon × Yosho

By Year 12, the relationship has become:
- Daily companionship
- Evening ritual (tea, conversation, stars)
- Emotional reliance (both directions)
- Something unspoken building

**Yosho:** Has been alive 700+ years. Has not felt this way about anyone in centuries.

**Sheldon:** Sees an elderly man who moves like a warrior, speaks like a philosopher, and looks at him with eyes that hold something ancient.

Neither acts. Neither speaks. But it's there.

### 8.4 — Training Focus: Year 12

| Area | Content |
|------|---------|
| Readiness | Final preparations |
| Integration | Phase II fully stable |
| Waiting | Something coming |

### 8.5 — Year 12 Ends
