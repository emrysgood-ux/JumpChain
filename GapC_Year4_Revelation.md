# OVERVIEW

**Tenchi's Age:** 7→8 (Elementary 2nd Grade)
**Sheldon's Apparent Age:** 25-26 (hasn't visibly aged)
**Time at Shrine:** 3 full years completed

This is the year Sheldon stops being a guest and becomes Yosho's true partner. Everything after this scene builds on what happens here.

# PART 1: THE TRIGGER

## 1.1 — The Incident

**Date:** Late autumn, Year 4 (October-November 1992)
**Location:** Shrine storage building, evening
**Circumstances:** Power outage during autumn storm

### What Happens:

Sheldon and Yosho are securing shrine equipment during a severe storm. The power goes out. Complete darkness in the windowless storage building.

Yosho reaches for a flashlight. Before he can turn it on, Sheldon says:

> "The ceremonial sake set is on the third shelf, left side. I'll get it."

Sheldon navigates the pitch-black room perfectly. Retrieves the item. Hands it to Yosho.

A beat of silence.

> "Sheldon-san. There is no light in this room."

Sheldon freezes. He didn't think. He just... saw.

**The Phase II ability:** Enhanced night vision. Not infrared, not echolocation — his eyes process ambient light at impossible efficiency. In complete darkness, he sees in shades of silver and blue.

He's been unconsciously suppressing it for three years. Stress made him forget.

---

## 1.2 — The Immediate Aftermath

Yosho says nothing more that night. They finish securing the shrine. The storm passes.

The next three days are... normal. Too normal. Yosho treats Sheldon exactly as before. But Sheldon catches the old man watching him. Measuring. Deciding something.

On the fourth day, Yosho invites Sheldon for tea after Tenchi goes to bed.

> "I believe we should talk, Sheldon-san. About what you are."

---

# PART 2: THE REVELATION SCENE

## 2.1 — Setting

**Date:** Four days after the incident
**Time:** 9:30 PM, after Tenchi is asleep
**Location:** Yosho's private room at the shrine office
**Atmosphere:** Single lamp. Tea prepared. Rain outside (lighter now).

This room is where Yosho handles shrine business. Sheldon has been here before, but never for a personal conversation. The invitation itself signals significance.

## 2.2 — The Conversation

### Opening:

Yosho pours tea. His movements are deliberate. He's giving Sheldon time to collect himself.

> **YOSHO:** "Three years. You have been here three years, Sheldon-san. In that time, I have watched you."

> **SHELDON:** "I know."

> **YOSHO:** "You knew I was watching."

> **SHELDON:** "You're not subtle when you want someone to know they're being observed. You wanted me to know."

A slight smile from Yosho. Approval.

> **YOSHO:** "And yet you stayed. Knowing I suspected... something."

> **SHELDON:** "Where else would I go?"

This lands. Yosho hears what's underneath: not defiance, but genuine uncertainty. Sheldon doesn't have anywhere else. The shrine became home without him planning it.

### The Question:

> **YOSHO:** "The other night. The storage building. You saw in complete darkness."

Not a question. A statement requiring response.

> **SHELDON:** "Yes."

> **YOSHO:** "That is not a human ability."

Sheldon sets down his tea. His hands are steady, but his heart is racing.

> **SHELDON:** "No. It's not."

> **YOSHO:** "Then what are you, Sheldon-san? I have considered many possibilities. None of them fit."

### The Decision:

Sheldon has rehearsed this moment in his head for three years. What to say. How much to reveal. He had plans. Careful, measured partial truths.

He abandons all of them.

This man took him in. Fed him. Gave him purpose. Trusted him with Tenchi. For three years, Yosho has treated Sheldon with quiet dignity and respect, never pushing, always watching, waiting for Sheldon to be ready.

Sheldon cannot lie to him anymore.

> **SHELDON:** "I died."

Yosho's expression doesn't change. He waits.

> **SHELDON:** "October 23rd, 2025. I was thirty-eight years old. A particle accelerator accident at the University of Alaska. I remember the light. I remember knowing it was over."

> **SHELDON:** "And then I woke up in a field outside your village. April 3rd, 1989. In a body that was twenty-two years old. With abilities I never had before. And a... presence... in my mind that I can barely perceive. Something that saved me. Something that *made* me."

> **SHELDON:** "I don't know what I am, Yosho-san. I know I was human once. I know I died. I know something brought me back, remade me, placed me here. I don't know why."

### Yosho's Response:

Silence. The rain continues outside. The lamp flickers once.

Yosho picks up his tea. Drinks. Sets it down.

> **YOSHO:** "2025."

> **SHELDON:** "Yes."

> **YOSHO:** "You are from the future."

> **SHELDON:** "From *a* future. Whether it's this world's future, I don't know."

> **YOSHO:** "And this presence. This thing that remade you. Do you know what it is?"

> **SHELDON:** "She calls herself... a name I can barely hold in my mind. I've dreamed of her twice. Silver hair. Kindness that feels like starlight. I think she's... something beyond human. Beyond anything I have words for."

> **YOSHO:** "A goddess."

It's not a question. Yosho says it with the certainty of someone who knows what goddesses are.

> **SHELDON:** "Maybe. I don't know what to call her. I only know she saved me. And she put me here. And I don't think it was random."

## 2.3 — Yosho's Counter-Revelation

A long pause. Yosho stands. Walks to the window. Looks out at the rain.

> **YOSHO:** "I am going to tell you something now, Sheldon-san. Something I have told no one on this Earth except my daughter, who is now dead. Something that will change how you understand everything about this shrine. This village. Me."

He turns back. In the lamplight, something shifts in his face. The grandfatherly mask slips — not falling away, but becoming transparent. Underneath is something older. Sharper. Sad.

> **YOSHO:** "My name is not Katsuhito Masaki. It is Yosho. I am Crown Prince of the Jurai Empire. I am seven hundred and thirty-two years old. And I am not human either."

---

## 2.4 — What Yosho Reveals

Over the next hour, Yosho shares:

### His Origin:
- Born on Jurai, heir to the throne
- Bonded to a First Generation Royal Tree (Funaho)
- His tree is the massive one on the shrine grounds — hidden in plain sight
- The tree sustains his life, keeps him young underneath the illusion of age

### Why He's Here:
- 700+ years ago, a demon attacked Jurai
- Yosho pursued her to Earth
- He defeated her but chose not to return home
- "I found something here worth staying for."

### The Sealed Cave:
- The demon is not dead
- She is sealed in the cave behind the shrine
- Has been for seven centuries
- "She sleeps. She dreams. Sometimes I feel her stirring."

### What He Does NOT Reveal (Yet):
- The demon's name (Ryoko)
- That she was created, not born evil
- That Washu exists in the gems
- The full truth about Tenchi's heritage
- That Tenchi will eventually awaken her

> **YOSHO:** "I tell you this because you told me truth. And because I believe the presence that sent you here... knew where she was sending you. There are no accidents with beings of that magnitude."

---

## 2.5 — The New Understanding

The conversation continues until nearly 2 AM. By the end:

**What Sheldon Now Knows:**
- Yosho is an alien prince, older than most nations
- There is a sealed demon in the cave
- The shrine is a prison as much as a holy site
- Tenchi has heritage Yosho hasn't fully explained
- Something is coming — Yosho can feel it

**What Yosho Now Knows:**
- Sheldon is a reincarnated human from the future
- He was remade by something Yosho suspects is Chousin-level
- His abilities are gifts, not trained skills
- He has no agenda beyond finding purpose
- He genuinely loves Tenchi and the shrine

**What Changes Immediately:**
- The formal "-san" begins dropping in private
- Yosho offers to help Sheldon understand his abilities
- They become co-guardians rather than employer/employee
- A new level of honesty enters all their interactions

---

# PART 3: THE AFTERMATH (Rest of Year 4)

## 3.1 — Training Begins

Within a week of the revelation, Yosho begins what he calls "adjustment sessions."

**Not Combat Training:**
Yosho explicitly does NOT train Sheldon to fight. "You are not a warrior. I will not make you one." Instead:

**Control Training:**
- How to suppress abilities consciously (so no more accidents)
- How to activate abilities deliberately
- Meditation techniques adapted from Juraian practice
- Energy awareness (sensing the flow of power, not wielding it)

**Knowledge Transfer:**
- History of Jurai (oral tradition, nothing written)
- The nature of Light Hawk Wings (theoretical — Sheldon can't manifest them yet)
- The Chousin — Yosho's understanding of the three goddesses
- Why Yosho suspects Sheldon's benefactor may be related to them

**Sessions:** Twice weekly, after Tenchi is asleep. 1-2 hours each.

## 3.2 — Daily Life Changes

**What's Different:**
- Sheldon and Yosho take evening walks together (previously rare)
- Conversations are deeper, more honest
- Yosho shares memories of Jurai — carefully, a little at a time
- Sheldon shares memories of his previous life — the loneliness, the work, the emptiness
- A genuine friendship forms between equals

**What Stays the Same:**
- Their public dynamic (for Tenchi and the village)
- Yosho still plays the elderly priest
- Sheldon still plays the helpful young man
- The masks remain, but they know what's underneath

## 3.3 — Tenchi's Perspective

Tenchi (age 8) notices something has changed but can't identify what. His grandfather and Sheldon-san seem... closer. They share looks sometimes. Private jokes he doesn't understand.

He likes it. His two favorite adults being friends makes home feel safer.

He doesn't ask questions. He's eight. The grown-ups are happy. That's enough.

## 3.4 — The Question of Romance

**Year 4 Status: NOT YET ROMANTIC**

The revelation creates intimacy, but not romantic intimacy. They are:
- Two lonely men who finally have someone to be honest with
- Partners in guardianship
- Friends discovering each other

The shift from friendship to romance is SLOW. Yosho has been alone for 700 years. Sheldon has spent his life avoiding intimacy. Neither of them rushes.

**First Signs (Late Year 4):**
- Yosho's hand on Sheldon's shoulder lingers slightly longer
- Sheldon finds himself looking at Yosho's real face (glimpsed once during training)
- Neither acts on anything
- Both are aware something is building
