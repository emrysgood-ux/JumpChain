# Tenchi Muyo OVA canon: fact verification results

The majority of claims about Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki canon are accurate, with several important corrections needed. Ryoko's release date of "August 13, 2001" is **not canonically confirmed**—the series uses a sliding timeline with August as the month but no specific day or year. Most significantly, **Tenchi's mother in OVA canon is Kiyone Masaki, not Achika**—Achika appears only in Tenchi Universe continuity. Yosho's birth occurred around **1262 CE**, not 300 CE as claimed. The Chousin lore, Juraian aging mechanics, and character relationships are largely verified as stated.

## Timeline events need partial correction

**Ryoko's release** occurs in August during Tenchi's summer vacation at his grandfather's shrine. The trigger mechanism is verified: Tenchi steals his grandfather's keys to enter the forbidden cave, finds the legendary sword (Tenchi-ken), and when the rusted blade shatters against a rock, it opens a secret passage to Ryoko's mummified form. The sword hilt glows upon her touch, enabling his escape, with Ryoko fully appearing the next day at his school. The August timing aligns with Obon festival (August 13-16), but no specific date is confirmed in canon.

The arrival sequence is confirmed with clear spacing. **Ayeka and Sasami arrive approximately one month later** in September, searching for their brother Yosho. **Mihoshi crashes in December** of the same year. The **Kagato arc culminates in February** the following year, when Mihoshi inadvertently frees Washu from the Sōja's alternate dimension where she had been imprisoned for **5,000 years**.

**Tenchi's birthday is confirmed as April 24**, though his birth year remains relative—OVA canon uses "Year -16" rather than calendar dates. The 1984 birth year specifically applies to Tenchi Universe continuity, not the OVA. His age at series start is listed as 15-17 depending on the source, with 1994 concert materials suggesting 17.

## Juraian aging mechanics operate through Royal Tree symbiosis

The Royal Tree bonding mechanism is thoroughly verified. Trees provide body strengthening, life extension treatments, and generate the **"Water of Life"** for rapid healing. Power flows from Tsunami-no-ki through a subspace network to all connected trees. Critically, **ordinary Juraians without tree bonds or bio-enhancement have normal human lifespans**—only royalty with first-generation tree bonds can live for millennia.

**Yosho/Katsuhito** is verified at **730 years old** in OVA 1. He appears 80-90 in his elderly Katsuhito disguise (a barrier illusion to avoid suspicion among Earthlings) while his true form appears around 30. However, the claim he was "born around 300 CE" is **incorrect**—the timeline places his birth around **1262 CE** if he's 730 years old during events set in the early 1990s.

**Ayeka's verified age is over 721 years** chronologically, with 700 of those in suspended animation aboard Ryu-Oh while searching for Yosho. She was physically 17 upon leaving Jurai and remains so. **Sasami is verified at 708 years** chronologically (700 in stasis), appearing and developmentally remaining 8 years old. Both ages derive from their Royal Tree connections—Ayeka to Ryu-Oh, and Sasami's unique assimilation with Tsunami herself.

For **Tenchi's hybrid aging**, the situation is unique. He doesn't require a Royal Tree because he possesses his own godlike powers (Light Hawk Wings) that transcend normal Juraian abilities. Creator commentary confirms he can live "a lot more" than hundreds of years. Other Masaki family members demonstrate the inherited longevity: Tennyo (Tenchi's sister) is over 80 but appears young, Nobuyuki was born in the 19th century, and Kiyone (Tenchi's mother, without bio-enhancement) lived to 248.

## Character relationships form a complex but verified web

The Jurai Royal Family structure is confirmed as follows:

**Yosho** is indeed **Azusa's eldest son and Crown Prince**, born to Azusa and his first wife **Funaho**. Funaho is verified as **originally from Earth**—a distant descendant of Masaki (sister of Jurai's first emperor) who considers herself Earthling since she was born on Earth. Azusa met her after being defeated by Kagato and subsequently brought her to Jurai as First Empress, causing political controversy over mixed bloodlines.

**Ayeka and Sasami** are daughters of Azusa and his **second wife Misaki**, making them Yosho's half-sisters. **Misaki is confirmed as Seto's biological daughter**, born to Seto Kamiki Jurai and her husband Utsutsumi Kamiki Jurai, head of House Kamiki.

**Seto Kamiki Jurai** indeed bears the title **"Devil Princess of Jurai"** due to her political craftiness and occasionally violent temper—even Emperor Azusa fears crossing her, and even Kagato knew not to challenge her. She operates as an extremely powerful behind-the-scenes figure, unofficial matchmaker, and arranged the marriage of her daughter Misaki to Azusa. A significant revelation: Seto is actually **Naja Akara**, Washu's former best friend and scientific partner who erased her own memories and regressed her age.

**Airi Masaki** is verified as Yosho's **current common-law wife** (never formally married due to political complications). She is from planet Airai and met Yosho at the Galaxy Police Academy. Airi is mother to **Minaho** and **Kiyone Masaki** (Tenchi's mother)—but **not Tennyo**, who is Kiyone's daughter (Airi's granddaughter). Yosho also had a first wife, **Kasumi** (Funaho's niece), whose descendants include Nobuyuki and others in Masaki Village.

**Critical correction: Tenchi's mother in OVA canon is Kiyone Masaki, not Achika.** Achika Masaki appears only in Tenchi Universe continuity and the film "Tenchi Muyo! in Love." Kiyone Masaki died at age 248 (suffering from senility without bio-enhancement) when Tenchi was young.

**Kiyone Masaki and Kiyone Makibi are completely different characters.** Kiyone Makibi (Mihoshi's Galaxy Police partner) was created by scriptwriter Naoko Hasegawa for spin-off novels and appears in Tenchi Universe, Tenchi in Tokyo, and other non-OVA works—but was deliberately kept out of OVA canon by creator Masaki Kajishima.

**Tennyo Masaki** is Tenchi's older sister, daughter of Kiyone and Nobuyuki. She's over 80 years old but appears young, is an exact physical double of her mother, and was introduced in OVA 3.

## The Chousin represent the highest cosmic order

All Chousin claims are verified. **Washu, Tsunami, and Tokimi** are the three Choushin—sister goddesses who created the multiverse and all 22 dimensions. Washu is the eldest, followed by Tsunami, then Tokimi (who uses "neesan"/older sister when addressing them). They correspond to the Triple Goddess archetype: Crone (Washu), Mother (Tokimi), Maiden (Tsunami).

**Tsunami is merged with Sasami**, verified through the backstory: when Sasami was approximately 3 years old during Ryoko's attack on Jurai (700 years before main events), she suffered a near-fatal fall in the Royal Arboretum. Tsunami-kami-sama assimilated with her and saved her life. Their two souls are gradually merging into one being—Tsunami's adult appearance represents Sasami's future form. This is revealed in OVA 2, Episode 9: "Sasami and Tsunami."

**Washu was sealed by Kagato for 5,000 years** inside her own battleship Sōja's alternate dimension. Kagato was her former assistant who helped create Ryoko, Ryo-Ohki, and the Sōja before betraying her.

**Tokimi's role** is confirmed: she remained in higher dimensions while her sisters descended to conduct experiments, creating chaos and distorting cosmic harmony to potentially cause the higher being to emerge. She moved galaxies and created space distortions; Z was the greatest "potential" she discovered.

The **Chousin experiment** is verified in full. They became aware of a possible higher power or Kami greater than themselves but couldn't prove its existence or create such a being. They created the multiverse as a practical approach to find or cause this being to emerge, with each sister taking different routes: Washu sealed her powers in three gems and became mortal to "think outside the box"; Tsunami created the Royal Trees from her own existence; Tokimi manipulated reality from higher dimensions. The result is **Tenchi Masaki as "Kami Tenchi"**—the only entity surpassing the Chousin.

## Ryoko's backstory aligns with all claims

**Ryoko was created by Washu** using her own egg cells (making Ryoko effectively her biological daughter), Masu (amorphous creatures with anti-matter capabilities), and three gems containing Washu's godly powers. Washu explicitly states: "I used my ova for you. So I'm more like your mother than your creator."

The **700-year imprisonment is verified exactly**—sealed around 1292 CE, released in the early 1990s. **Yosho sealed her** after pursuing her from Jurai to Earth, defeating her, confiscating her three gems (affixing them to Tenchi-ken's pommel), and sealing her in the cave.

**Astral projection while sealed is confirmed.** Ryoko could create an astral body and venture to the cave entrance, observing Tenchi grow from baby to teenager. This may have been intentional on Yosho's part to help her develop emotionally.

**Ryo-Ohki's connection to Ryoko** is deep: both were created by Washu as Masu-hybrids (effectively "sisters"), Ryo-Ohki serves as Ryoko's companion spacecraft and power conduit for the gems, they share a telepathic link, and together with all three gems they equal a first-generation Juraian Treeship capable of generating ten Light Hawk Wings.

## Kagato's role matches the claims precisely

**Kagato was Washu's assistant** (specifically termed this rather than "student") at Galaxy Academy. He assisted in creating Ryoko, Ryo-Ohki, and the Sōja before imprisoning Washu for 5,000 years. He **claimed her creations as his own** and **brainwashed Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki** through psychic control via the gems, using them to pillage the galaxy as "Ruins Buster" (destroying 3,326 ruins with great loss of life).

The **Sōja** is Washu's creation that Kagato stole. It served as her prison, his base of operations, and contains giant replicated gems. Its name means "twin serpents," reflecting its dual-dimension structure. Tenchi destroyed both Kagato and the Sōja when he first manifested Light Hawk Wings.

## Masaki Shrine details are fully verified

The shrine is located in **rural Okayama Prefecture, Japan**, near Masaki Village (specifically modeled after Tarojinja shrine in Asaguchi city). 

**Funaho** is verified as Yosho's first-generation Royal Tree, now rooted at the shrine and therefore unable to take ship form. This is why Yosho cannot leave Earth—Juraian royalty remain immortal only within range of their trees. Ryoko's three gems embedded in Tenchi-ken supplied power to Funaho for 700 years. In OVA 1, Episode 3, Ayeka identifies the shrine tree as Funaho-ki and witnesses the final Yosho-Ryoko battle through its memory.

The **cave where Ryoko was sealed is confirmed near the shrine**, serving dual purposes as place of worship and Ryoko's prison for seven centuries.

## Light Hawk Wings represent the pinnacle of dimensional power

Light Hawk Wings are **pure energy constructs** described as the "bio-energy of the gods." They can only be generated by the Chousin, those granted portions of their power (Juraian Royal Trees via Tsunami), and anomalies like Z and Tenchi. Primary function is an impenetrable defensive shield; secondary function is devastating offensive capability.

**Tenchi initially manifested 3 Wings** against Kagato, later generating **6 Wings** in OVA 3 when protecting Earth from the Chobimaru. For comparison, Z generated 5 Wings, while Tsunami can generate 10 (the maximum 3-dimensional spacetime can support before being destroyed). Tenchi has **no theoretical limit** but is constrained by dimensional physics.

Tenchi possesses a unique ability: he can freely convert Light Hawk Wing energy into **matter** (armor, shields, sword)—something no other user can do. This marks them as the ultimate power in the Tenchi universe's 3-dimensional realm, surpassed only by the Chousin themselves and Kami Tenchi.
