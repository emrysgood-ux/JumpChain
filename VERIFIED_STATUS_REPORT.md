- **User verification required for compiled documents**

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (User Action Required)
1. **Verify compiled documents locally**
   - Open CHAPTER_1_COMPILED.md
   - Open CHAPTER_1_PROSE_ONLY.md
   - Report: Valid prose or corrupted?

### If Compiled Docs Are Valid
- Extract Days 2-28 prose
- Organize into folder structure
- Continue from Day 29+ (May 1989)

### If Compiled Docs Are Corrupted
- Day 1 is foundation (15,580 words complete)
- Use scene registries to write Days 2-28
- Estimated remaining for Chapter 1: ~150,000-180,000 words

---

## WRITING CONTINUATION PARAMETERS

When continuing with Claude, provide:
1. This status document
2. Story Bible (or confirm v19 is canonical)
3. Specific starting point (Day X, Scene Y)
4. Master Codex reference (if available)

### Key Rules to Maintain
- Forbidden words: NEVER use Cosmos, Sailor, Lambda, Jurai, Galaxy Police, Ryoko, Washu, Tsunami, Kagato, Ayeka, Sasami, Royal Tree, or Phase I/II/III in Sheldon's POV
- Sheldon refers to his benefactor only as "the system," "the presence," or "whatever brought him here"
- Sheldon lives at shrine guest room Days 1-17, moves to Tsukino house Day 18
- 320 steps is canonical (real Tarojinja shrine reference)
- Multi-POV uses chronological interleaving per Law 36/A7
