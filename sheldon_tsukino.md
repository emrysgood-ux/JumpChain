### TIMELINE PARADOX NOTES

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Calendar birth year (U1) | 1987 |
| Calendar death year (U1) | 2025 |
| Calendar arrival year (U2) | 1989 |
| Years displaced | 36 years backward |
| Subjective age at death | 38 |
| Body age at resurrection | ~22 |
| Years "lost" physically | 16 |

**The Paradox:** Sheldon arrives in 1989, which is 2 years AFTER his original birth but 36 years BEFORE his death. In Universe 2, he will "outlive" his original self by centuries.

**What Sheldon Knows:** He died in 2025. He woke up in 1989. He doesn't fully understand the mechanics.

---

## TSUKINO IDENTITY

**Critical:** The Tsukino family is REAL, not fabricated.

| Document | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Birth Certificate | Real (Cosmos-created history) |
| Koseki (Family Registry) | Real, registered in Okayama |
| Passport | Real, dual Japanese/American |
| Entry Records | Flew into Osaka April 1-2, 1989 |

**Family History (Cosmos-Created):**
- Parents died in accident (mirrors his real history)
- Inherited house in village near Masaki Shrine
- Distant relative of Tsukino family

**The Tsukino House:**
- Location: ~300m from Masaki Shrine
- Inherited from "family"
- Sheldon moves there Day 17+
- Traditional Japanese construction with some modern updates

- Nostalgic references to Grandmama's wisdom
- Surprised by his own emotions

### Sample Lines
- "That's not how thermodynamics works, but sure."
