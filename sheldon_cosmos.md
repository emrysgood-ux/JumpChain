## THE BOND'S NATURE

### What Cosmos Did
1. Intercepted Sheldon's soul at death
2. Rebuilt his body using Lambda Power
3. Granted him abilities (JumpChain + Celestial Pack)
4. Placed him in a universe to heal
5. Chose him as her First Son

### What This Means
- Not biological but chosen
- Created, not birthed
- Permanent cosmic connection
- She can sense him always
- He feels her as "the warmth"

### Why "Son" Matters
- All previous Sailor lineage: daughters only
- Sheldon breaks a pattern billions of years old
- First male heir to Lambda Power
- Significance unclear even to Cosmos
- "I don't know why you. But I'm glad it was."
