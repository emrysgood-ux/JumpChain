## REMAINING WORK

### Category A: Scene Registry Creation (Days 3-21)

These days have hour-by-hour tracking but NO scene registries.

**Required Action:** Convert each 60-minute tracking block into a scene definition with:
- Scene number
- POV assignment
- Location
- Characters present
- Events summary
- Word target

**Estimated Output:**
- 19 days × 15 scenes average = 285 scene definitions
- 19 days × 25,000 words average = 475,000 words

These days have scene registries with 60-90 minute blocks (BORDERLINE compliant).

**Current State:**
- Days 23-29: 14-16 scenes each
- Mostly 60-90 minute blocks
- Better than Days 1-2, 22 but still compressed

**Required Action:** Review each 90-minute block for subdivision opportunities

| Day | Date | Current Scenes | Est. After Review |
|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 23 | April 25 | 14 | 18-20 |
| 24 | April 26 | 14 | 18-20 |
| 25 | April 27 | 13 | 16-18 |
| 26 | April 28 | 14 | 18-20 |
| 27 | April 29 (Shōwa Day) | 16 | 22-25 |
| 28 | April 30 | 14 | 18-20 |
