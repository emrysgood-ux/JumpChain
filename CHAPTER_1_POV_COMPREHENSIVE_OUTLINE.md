**DAY 1 — Monday, April 3, 1989**
*Theme: Awakening into impossibility*

| Time | Event | Internal State |
|------|-------|----------------|
| ~14:47 | Wakes in grass field | Disbelief — "I died" |
| 15:00 | Discovers body changes | Scientific catalog of impossibility |

| 19:30 | First dinner | Observing household dynamics |
| 21:00 | Guest room assigned | "The squeaky door" |

*Sheldon's Experience:* Everything filtered through scientist's mind. Cataloging observations. Trying to construct hypotheses from insufficient data. The warmth he felt during death — filed away, unexplained. The presence that guided him — referred to only as "the system," "his benefactor."

---

**DAY 2 — Tuesday, April 4, 1989**
*Theme: First full day — establishing routine*

| Time | Event | Internal State |

| 19:00 | Second dinner | Learning table rituals |

# PART II: KATSUHITO MASAKI POV
## The Seven-Hundred-Year Observer

### Core Character Arc
**Day 1:** Assessment begins — "What pattern brought this stranger?"
**Days 2-7:** Testing through observation
**Days 8-14:** Recognition — "He fits in a way visitors rarely fit"
**Days 15-21:** Investment — actively teaching, not just observing
**Days 22-29:** Hope — "Perhaps this time will be different"

### What Katsuhito KNOWS
- Everything about Jurai, his true nature, the seal, Ryoko
- How to read people (700 years of pattern recognition)
- That Sheldon looked at the lake like he KNEW something was there
- That the shrine grounds "settled" when Sheldon arrived
- That this stranger hesitates over his own name

### What Katsuhito NOTICES About Sheldon
From THREE_POV Day 1:
- Hesitates over his own name (as if learning to wear it)
- Doodles atomic structures in margins when mind wanders
- Hums gospel while working (unconscious)
- Straightens the woodpile without noticing
- Looks at the lake with impossible knowledge
- The shrine energy harmonizes with his presence

### Katsuhito's Internal Voice
- 700 years of solitude, broken only by those who age and die
- Recently lost Kiyone — "alone with a grieving child and the weight of centuries"
- The mathematics of the seal: ~12 years until Tenchi can reach the cave
- Hope is dangerous — he's learned caution
- Yet: "the universe does not arrange such things by accident"

---

## KATSUHITO: DAY-BY-DAY OUTLINE

**DAY 1**
Village gossip network reports stranger climbing steps. Katsuhito cultivates appearance of "old man enjoying afternoon air" — mask over 700 years. Watches Sheldon pause at step 147 (unusual), study the lake (concerning), climb without winding (physical capability noted). First conversation: Sheldon hesitates over his own name. Files observation away.

Evening: Sheldon traces constellations, murmuring names. "A scientist who harmonizes with shrine energy as though designed for it."

Final thought: "Small and fragile and probably foolish. But present nonetheless. Hope."

---

**DAYS 2-7**
Testing through small observations:
- Day 2: Sheldon makes each mistake only once
- Day 3: Atom doodles in margins discovered
- Day 4: Cooking skill emerges — Katsuhito watches, says nothing
- Day 5: Work ethic confirmed
- Day 6-7: Nobuyuki's assessment observed; Katsuhito notes Sheldon managing it well

---

**DAYS 8-14**
Active teaching begins. Not formal instruction but the kind Katsuhito offers rarely — conversations with depth, questions that test understanding. Sheldon responds appropriately. The grandson connection deepens — Tenchi gravitating to Sheldon, Sheldon accepting without overstepping.

Nobuyuki's second visit: Katsuhito watches the two men find common ground. Something settling into place.

---

**DAYS 15-21**
"The threads are weaving themselves into a pattern. I cannot yet see its shape, but I can feel its presence."

Katsuhito begins trusting Sheldon with small shrine responsibilities. Not the sacred duties — those remain his — but the maintenance of place, the rhythm of household, the care of Tenchi.

---

**DAYS 22-29**
Birthday: Katsuhito watches Sheldon participate in family celebration. Notes how naturally he fits. The wariness of a 700-year survivor persists, but beneath it: genuine investment.

Final day: On the engawa, both men look at the same sunset. Katsuhito knows what he hopes. Whether Sheldon can see it — whether the pattern will hold — remains to be proven over years, not days.

---

# PART III: TENCHI MASAKI POV
## The Five-Year-Old Who Sees Clearly

### Core Character Arc
**Day 1:** Discovery — "The new person is sad like me"
**Days 2-7:** Testing — Can I trust him?
**Days 8-14:** Trust — "He stays still when I lean"
**Days 15-21:** Family — "Sheru-nii"
**Days 22-29:** Joy — Birthday with someone new to love

### What Tenchi KNOWS
- Mama died three months ago
- Grandpa is old and wise
- Rea-nee keeps the household running
- Daddy comes on weekends

### What Tenchi PERCEIVES (Child's Wisdom)
From THREE_POV Day 1:
- "Chocolate skin" — notices difference without judgment
- Sad people "hold their shoulders a certain way, like carrying something heavy no one else can see"
- The new person "was supposed to be here, was always supposed to be here"
- When Tenchi leaned against him, "he stayed very still, very steady, letting Tenchi lean"

### Tenchi's Internal Voice
- Processing grief through action and connection
- Usagi-chan as confidant
- Kabutaro (beetle) as project, gift from before Mama died
- Questions tumble out before he can stop them
- "Kindness is free so you should give it away as much as you can" — Mama's words

---

## TENCHI: DAY-BY-DAY OUTLINE

**DAY 1**
Hides behind the big tree watching. Ninja observation. Notes: chocolate skin, nice clothes, different bow, sad shoulders. Takes the new person's hand: "It's okay. Something happened to me too. We can be sad together."

Tour of grounds — beetle spot, the big tree that "knows secrets people have forgotten," the lake where "we're not supposed to go alone."

Bedtime moment: "Will you still be here tomorrow?" / "Yes." / "And the day after that?" / "And the day after that."

---

**DAYS 2-7**
Building trust. Sheldon-san becomes comfortable presence. Tenchi tests: Will he listen? (Yes.) Will he laugh at my jokes? (The real laugh, not the fake one.) Will he stay?

By Day 7: Confirmation that Sheldon is staying. Relief.

---

**DAYS 8-14**
"Sheru-ji" nickname created (Day 13). Familiar enough for affectionate diminutive. Daddy meets the new person — Tenchi anxious about the assessment, relieved when it goes well.

---

**DAYS 15-21**
Forest walk. Cave encounter. Tenchi asks about Mama, shares her words. Sheldon doesn't flinch from grief talk. "Sheru-nii" — the shift from polite distance to family.

---

**DAYS 22-29**
Birthday: First birthday without Mama, but first birthday WITH someone new. Candles, cake, presents. The household complete in a new configuration. Tenchi's joy is genuine — grief hasn't disappeared, but it has company now.

---

# PART IV: REA MASAKI POV
## The Guardian Who Watches

### Core Character Arc
[NOTE: Rea does NOT have POV in THREE_POV document, but she is present throughout]

**Day 1:** Assessment — who is this stranger entering my household?
**Days 2-7:** Testing — is he safe around Tenchi?
**Days 8-14:** Acceptance — he helps, he doesn't disrupt
**Days 15-21:** Trust — she shares information about Kiyone
**Days 22-29:** Family — another person to protect/serve

---

## REA: SCENE PRESENCE (NOT POV)

Rea appears in:
- Morning kitchen scenes (preparing breakfast AND lunch before school)
- Evening returns (household "expands")
- Weekend full presence
- Key conversations happen at appropriate times (evening, weekend)

Her backstory (orphan, institution, Kiyone finding her, "broken/unreachable" label) should be delivered through:
- Katsuhito's perspective (what he knows)
- Evening conversations with Sheldon (earned trust)
- Not midday scenes when she's at school

---

### Core Character Arc
**Day 6 (first appearance):** Assessment — who is this stranger in my family?
**Day 7:** Tentative acceptance

### What Nobuyuki KNOWS
- Kiyone is dead (~1988)
- He works in Tokyo, visits weekends
- The shrine household manages without him (barely)
- He worries about Tenchi
- Architecture is his profession

### What Nobuyuki FEARS
- The household failing Tenchi
- Being replaced
- Losing connection to the shrine
- Moving on from Kiyone

### Nobuyuki's Assessment of Sheldon
- Day 6: Wariness, protective instinct
- Day 7: "He's useful. The house inspection impressed me."
- Day 14: "We share something. Loss. Competence. The desire to be useful."
- Later: "Kiyone would have liked him. She collected people who didn't quite fit."

# PART VII: OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Day 17 "Mudroom" Reference** — What event? Pet? Move to Tsukino house?

2. **Birthday Date Discrepancy** — Trajectory says Day 22, userMemories says April 24 (Day 22 would be April 24 if Day 1 = April 3, so this aligns)

3. **Rea POV** — Include or remain secondary? THREE_POV doesn't have her POV, but she's significant.

4. **Scene Count** — Foundation has ~185k words across 28 days. What density are we targeting?

5. **Word Count Per Day** — Days 1-3 current drafts are ~19k average. Sustainable? Too dense?

---
