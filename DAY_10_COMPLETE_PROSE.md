## SCENE 1: PRE-DAWN AWARENESS
**Time:** 05:10:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Tomorrow was the council meeting.

The thought arrived before full consciousness, settling into his awareness alongside the gray light filtering through shoji screens. He'd slept adequately but not deeply, his mind processing scenarios that refused to resolve into restful dreams.

He lay still, cataloging his body's state. No aches—the physical labor that should have accumulated damage produced none. No stiffness—his joints moved freely when he tested them beneath the covers. The body continued to function as if designed for exactly this life, this work, this climate.

The mind was another matter. Anxiety had settled somewhere beneath his ribs, a weight that had nothing to do with physical cause. Tomorrow he would be evaluated by people who had every right to question his presence, his intentions, his legitimacy.

He rose before the uguisu could announce the morning.

## SCENE 2: MORNING OBSERVATION
**Time:** 05:35:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Katsuhito was already awake.

The priest sat on the engawa facing the shrine buildings, the posture suggesting meditation or prayer or simply the presence that came from occupying a space without agenda. Sheldon hesitated at the door, uncertain whether to interrupt.

"Join me," Katsuhito said without turning.

Sheldon sat on the engawa's edge, leaving respectful distance between them. The morning air carried the particular crispness that preceded warmer days—a promise of spring's continued advancement toward summer.

"You're worried about tomorrow."

"Yes."

"Good." The priest's voice remained calm. "Worry indicates you understand what's at stake. People who face evaluation without worry either don't understand the situation or don't care about the outcome. Neither is admirable."

"What if I say the wrong thing?"

"Then you'll have said the wrong thing. The council will note it, consider it alongside everything else they know about you, and reach their conclusions. One wrong answer doesn't define a person—patterns do. You've been here ten days. Your patterns are already visible."

## SCENE 3: BREAKFAST ROUTINE
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Tenchi ate breakfast with oblivious contentment.

The boy showed no awareness that tomorrow carried significance for the household's newest member. For him, the day held only its ordinary shapes: kindergarten, friends, the routines that structured his small world. The council meeting existed in adult space, invisible to four-year-old concerns.

Sheldon found the obliviousness comforting. Tenchi's world continued regardless of what the council decided. Rice would still need eating. Beetles would still need observation. The fundamental structures of childhood remained stable even when adult circumstances shifted.

"You're quiet today," Tenchi observed.

"I'm thinking."

"About bugs?"

"About other things." Sheldon managed a small smile. "But I could think about bugs if you'd like to tell me about them."

Tenchi launched into a detailed account of the kabutomushi larva's overnight activities—movements within its soil container, changes in position that the boy interpreted as significant. The description required no response beyond attention, and attention Sheldon could provide.

---

## SCENE 4: WALK TO WORK SITE
**Time:** 07:20:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between shrine and Tsukino House

The path felt longer today.

Not physically longer—the distance remained what it had always been. But his mind traveled ahead to tomorrow's meeting even as his feet covered familiar ground, creating a doubled awareness that made each step feel like passage through both space and time.

The cherry trees had fully transformed now, their spring show concluded, summer preparation underway. The leaves filtered sunlight differently than blossoms had—greener, denser, more concerned with growth than display. The change had happened gradually enough that he might not have noticed it happening, only the completed result.

*Like reputation*, he thought. *Built gradually, noticed suddenly.*

Tomorrow the council would examine the result of ten days' accumulation. The individual moments—the work site arrivals, the village interactions, the meals shared and conversations held—would resolve into some composite impression that might not reflect how any single day had actually felt.

---

## SCENE 5: WEST SIDE SPLICE
**Time:** 08:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

Yamada had begun the ridge beam splice on the west side.

The work required precision that made tile removal look crude by comparison. Each cut followed lines marked in pencil on the beam's surface, the saw moving through wood with the patience of someone who understood that speed and quality rarely coexisted.

"Watch the angle," Yamada said, not looking up from his work. "The *okkake daisen tsugi* requires faces that mate perfectly. Any deviation becomes a weakness."

Sheldon watched from a position that allowed observation without interference. The saw moved in strokes so consistent they might have been machine-generated—but no machine could replicate the subtle adjustments Yamada made for grain variation, density changes, the wood's particular character in each section.

"How long does this technique take to learn?"

"Longer than you have available today." The carpenter's voice held no criticism, only fact. "But watching teaches something. The eye learns before the hand does."

---

## SCENE 6: TENON CUTTING
**Time:** 09:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, ground level work area

The new timber waited in the work area, pre-cut to approximate length.

Yamada had descended to shape the tenon that would mate with the mortise being cut into the existing beam. The work required different tools—chisels rather than saws, mallets rather than pressure—but the same patience and precision.

"The old builders spent more time on joinery than on any other aspect of construction," Yamada said between mallet strikes. "They understood that connections determine everything. A building with perfect materials and weak joints will fail. A building with adequate materials and perfect joints will stand for centuries."

Sheldon filed this away alongside the other fragments of philosophy Yamada offered during work. The carpenter taught through example and aphorism, never through extended explanation. Understanding had to be extracted from context, assembled from pieces that only made sense in combination.

"The council meeting tomorrow," Sheldon said. "You'll be there?"

"I attend when I have business before the council. I have none tomorrow." Yamada didn't look up from his chisel work. "But I know what they'll discuss. Everyone does."

---

## SCENE 7: LUNCH CONVERSATION
**Time:** 12:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Takeshi had opinions about the council.

"They mean well," the nephew said, arranging his lunch items with the methodical attention he brought to all tasks. "But meaning well and doing well aren't the same thing. Some of them remember the war, remember the occupation, remember when strangers meant danger. That memory colors how they see newcomers."

"You think they'll be suspicious?"

"I think they'll be cautious. Suspicion implies they're looking for reasons to reject you. Caution means they're waiting for reasons to accept." Takeshi bit into his onigiri. "Give them reasons."

"Katsuhito-san has been preparing me. Names, concerns, what each member cares about."

"The priest knows them well. His advice is worth following." Takeshi paused, considering something. "But don't try to be what they want. Try to show them what you are. People can sense performance, and performance breeds distrust."

"What if what I am isn't what they want?"

"Then you'll know where you stand. Better than wondering."

---

## SCENE 8: AFTERNOON PROGRESS
**Time:** 14:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof structure

The west side splice was taking shape.

Yamada had cut the mortise into the existing beam, removing damaged wood and creating a clean face for the new tenon to meet. The joint's complexity became visible as the cuts progressed—interlocking angles that would transfer load across the connection without relying on friction alone.

"Come up," Yamada called.

Sheldon climbed the scaffolding to the ridge beam level, careful to distribute his weight across structural members rather than unsupported sections. The carpenter pointed to the joint's interior.

"See how the faces meet at angles? The *okkake* design uses gravity to tighten the connection. As the roof settles—and all roofs settle—the joint pulls tighter rather than loosening. The old builders designed for time, not just for the moment of construction."

"That's remarkable."

"It's practical. They couldn't return to tighten bolts every decade, so they designed joints that improved with age." Yamada ran his hand along the cut surface. "Modern construction uses metal fasteners because they're fast. Traditional construction uses wood joinery because it lasts. Different priorities produce different buildings."

---

## SCENE 9: VILLAGE OBSERVATION
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

The village sounds drifted up the mountain.

Sheldon sat on the engawa during a break, listening to the acoustic texture of the community below. Children returning from school, their voices carrying farther than seemed possible. Agricultural machinery operating in distant fields. The occasional vehicle on the road that connected the village to the larger world.

Tomorrow these people would discuss him. Not all of them—five council members representing the larger population—but the decision would affect his relationship with everyone. Acceptance meant belonging. Rejection meant... what? He could still repair the house, still live in it. But he would exist outside the social fabric, present but not integrated.

*The house that had waited for him. The village that might not.*

He tried to imagine the life of a permanent outsider. Acknowledged but not accepted. Tolerated but not welcomed. The house would be shelter, not home. The mountain would be location, not belonging.

The prospect felt more frightening than he'd expected.

---

## SCENE 10: EVENING RETURN
**Time:** 17:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds

The Funaho tree's presence touched his awareness as he passed.

Not physically—the tree stood in its customary place, roots deep, branches high. But something in its attention felt different today, more focused, as if the tree were aware of tomorrow's significance and curious about the outcome.

He stopped walking and faced the tree directly.

"You're watching me," he said quietly, feeling foolish for addressing a plant. "You've been watching since I arrived."

No response. Trees didn't respond. But the quality of attention didn't waver—steady, patient, interested in ways that defied botanical explanation.

"I don't know why you're here," he continued. "I don't know why any of this is happening. But I'm grateful for the attention, even if I don't understand it."

The tree continued watching. Sheldon continued walking. Neither of them had resolved anything, but the acknowledgment felt necessary.

---

## SCENE 11: DINNER DYNAMICS
**Time:** 18:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Dinner was subdued.

Katsuhito had prepared a simple meal—rice, grilled fish, miso soup, pickled vegetables. The lack of complexity seemed intentional, as if elaborate food would be inappropriate on the night before evaluation.

"Tomorrow," Katsuhito said after the meal, "you'll walk to the community center alone. The meeting begins at seven in the evening. Arrive five minutes early—not more, not less. Early enough to show respect; not so early that you appear anxious."

"Should I bring anything?"

"Only yourself. The council will provide tea. Accepting it is expected; asking for more is not." The priest's instructions carried the weight of protocol long established. "They'll ask questions in order of seniority. Answer each completely before the next is asked. Don't volunteer information beyond what's requested, but don't withhold it either."

"That sounds like a balance I might not achieve."

"You'll find it. The council's questions aren't designed to trap you—they're designed to reveal you. Let them reveal what they're meant to reveal."

---

## SCENE 12: BATH REFLECTION
**Time:** 19:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

The water held him in familiar warmth.

Sheldon soaked in the ofuro, his mind cycling through tomorrow's possibilities. Questions he might be asked. Answers he might give. Expressions on faces he'd never seen but could imagine—curiosity, skepticism, the careful neutrality of people reserving judgment.

The body he occupied had no stake in the outcome. It would continue functioning regardless of what the council decided—eating, sleeping, working, existing. The mind he inhabited cared deeply. Without acceptance, the integration he'd begun to feel would remain incomplete, a bridge built halfway across a gap.

He had been here ten days. Long enough to want belonging. Short enough that belonging remained uncertain.

The water cooled slightly. He added hot from the tap, extending the soak beyond its usual duration. Tomorrow required rest, and rest required the body's relaxation even if the mind refused to follow.

---

## SCENE 13: TENCHI'S GOODNIGHT
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, hallway

The boy appeared in his sleeping yukata.

"Goodnight, Sheldon-san."

"Goodnight, Tenchi-kun."

The formal exchange had become ritual—a small recognition of presence before sleep separated them. Tenchi's face showed none of tomorrow's weight; for him, sleep was simply sleep, and tomorrow was simply Thursday.

"Grandfather said you have an important meeting."

"I do."

"Will you be okay?"

The question landed with unexpected impact. A four-year-old's concern for an adult's wellbeing, expressed with the directness that children employed before learning to hide such things.

"I think so. I hope so."

"Grandfather says you'll be fine. He says the village needs to see what he's seen."

"What has he seen?"

Tenchi considered this with the seriousness he applied to all questions worth answering. "Someone who belongs here. That's what he said. I think that means you're supposed to stay."

---

## SCENE 14: NIGHT VIGIL
**Time:** 22:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Sleep eluded him.

Sheldon lay on the futon, body relaxed but mind churning. The darkness held no distractions—only the sounds of the house settling, the shrine's nighttime presence, the distant calls of creatures whose names he still didn't know.

Tomorrow he would be evaluated by people who had every right to question him. His story—the parts of it he could tell—was strange enough to breed suspicion. A man from America claiming Japanese heritage, arriving in a village where his family had lived for generations, planning to restore a house that had waited for someone exactly like him.

It sounded like a story. Stories were what people told when truth was either too strange or too simple to believe.

But the truth was strange. He had died and been given a second chance. He had been placed here by something he couldn't name for purposes he couldn't understand. The family history that documented his belonging had been created by the same force that created this new life—real in every way that mattered, but not real in the way his previous life had been real.

*Does the difference matter?*

The question had no answer that satisfied him. Perhaps the council would find one.

---

## SCENE 15: SLEEP
**Time:** 23:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Consciousness finally released him.

The transition happened without warning—one moment he was cataloging anxieties, the next he was simply not present. Sleep took him into depths that offered no dreams, no presence at the edge of awareness, only the darkness that restored what waking hours depleted.

Tomorrow would arrive regardless of how he spent the night. The council would meet. Questions would be asked. Answers would be given.

And then he would know whether this place—this mountain, this village, this household—would accept him as one of its own.

The night held him gently, offering rest without resolution.
