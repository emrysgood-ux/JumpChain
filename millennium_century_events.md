## OVERVIEW: THE SILVER MILLENNIUM

**Name Origin:** Named for Sailor Cosmos's legacy—Queen Serenity's thousand-year reign over the Moon Kingdom. Cosmos's son now builds his own millennium.

**Scope:** 900 years of post-foundation history, from the end of the First Century to Yosho's peaceful death and Sheldon's departure.

**Core Constants Across All Centuries:**
- The Masaki Shrine (rebuilt, expanded, but always home)
- The core family unit (Sheldon, Yosho, Tenchi, the aunts)
- Funaho, rooted and eternal
- The love that started it all

**What Transforms:**
- Japan: from 1989 nation-state to whatever 2989 brings
- Earth: from single-world civilization to interstellar hub
- The Masaki line: from three people to thousands of descendants
- Human understanding of the cosmos
- Sheldon's power: from hidden abilities to cosmic mastery

## WHAT-IF SCENARIOS TO DEVELOP

Each Era should have cascading consequences from Sheldon's presence:

**Century 2:** How does having a cosmic entity as family patron affect Masaki political expansion?

**Century 3:** Earth's galactic integration happens faster/differently because of shrine's reputation?

**Century 4:** Golden age enabled by stability Sheldon provides?
