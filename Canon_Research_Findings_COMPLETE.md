# FINDING 1: RYOKO'S ASTRAL OBSERVATION

## What Canon Establishes

| Fact | Source | Confidence |
|------|--------|------------|
| Could create astral body while sealed | Tenchi Wiki, FAQ | CONFIRMED |
| Could venture to cave entrance | Wiki | CONFIRMED |
| Watched Tenchi grow from infancy to 17 | Multiple sources | CONFIRMED |
| Yosho planned this deliberately | 101 Secrets book | CONFIRMED |
| Kiyone (mother) helped bring young Tenchi near cave | FAQ | CONFIRMED |
| Could affect physical world (saved cat Chibi) | 101 Secrets | CONFIRMED |
| Was awake entire 700 years | FAQ | CONFIRMED |
| Felt cold, damp, loneliness | FAQ | CONFIRMED |
| Attack on Tenchi was "letting off steam" not serious | 101 Secrets | CONFIRMED |

## Range Limitation

The astral body could venture "to the entrance of the cave" — implying limited range around the shrine grounds, not unlimited observation.

## Implications for Our Story

**LOCKED:** Ryoko observed Sheldon for 12 years (April 1989 - April 2001) via astral projection.

| She Would Have Seen | She Would NOT Have Seen |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Sheldon's arrival at shrine | Events in the village |
| Daily life at shrine grounds | Conversations at Tsukino house |
| Cooking, laughter, family interactions | Sheldon's internal thoughts |
| Sheldon-Tenchi relationship | Sheldon's dreams of Cosmos |
| Sheldon-Yosho growing closeness | Private moments away from shrine |
| Tenchi's development and training | Written communications |

**CRITICAL:** Ryoko knows Sheldon before physical release. She has 12 years of observation data on this family dynamic. She is NOT meeting strangers — she is finally physically joining a family she's been watching.

# FINDING 2: WASHU'S DETECTION CAPABILITIES

## What Canon Establishes

| Capability | Source | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Greatest scientific genius in universe | Multiple | Uncontested fact |
| One of the Chousin (sealed goddess) | Wiki | Divine origin, currently mortal |
| Powers/memories sealed in three gems | Wiki | Self-imposed limitation |
| Mentally connected to Ryoko | CBR, Wiki | Telepathic link while sealed |
| Created beings handling 10 LHW | VS Battles | Understanding of cosmic power |
| Can operate across dimensions | Wiki | Canceled Ryoko's petrification from another dimension |
| Robots analyze via "universal databank" | VS Battles | Systematic detection capability |
| Prefers reason/technology over powers | Multiple | Scientific approach first |
| Immediate interest in Tenchi's LHW | Wiki | Drawn to anomalous power |
| Took immediate interest after Kagato battle | Wiki | Pattern of investigating anomalies |

## Detection Method

Washu detected Zero NOT through power signature but through **physical marking** (Dr. Clay's logo on Zero's buttocks during bath). This suggests:

1. Perfect power copies can fool even Washu initially
2. Physical evidence trumps power sensing
3. Washu is observant but not omniscient while mortal

## Implications for Our Story

**Washu WILL detect something anomalous about Sheldon.** The questions are:

| Question | Probable Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| How quickly? | Within days of joining household |
| What will she detect? | Power signature that doesn't match any known classification |
| What will she conclude? | "Another god's work" — but can't identify which |
| Will she confront Sheldon? | Eventually, but investigation first |
| Will she contact other Chousin? | Not immediately — they're not reunited until Z arc |

**LOCKED:** Washu detects anomaly. Categorizes as "unexplained phenomenon requiring study." Does NOT immediately recognize Cosmos's divine signature.

# FINDING 3: CHOUSIN NATURE AND LIMITATIONS

## What Canon Establishes

| Fact | Source | Implications |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent | Multiple | Should sense everything in their creation |
| Created multiverse and 22+ dimensions | Wiki | This is THEIR universe |
| Searching for being greater than themselves | Canon | Focused on that specific goal |
| **Cannot prove existence of higher being** | Wiki | Fundamental limitation |
| Zero couldn't prove Tokimi existed when seeing her | Wiki | Detection has limits |
| Washu sealed her memories AND powers | Wiki | Mortal Washu is LIMITED |
| Sisters not reunited until Z arc | Canon | No cross-verification until OVA 3 |
| Each took different approach | Wiki | Different detection frameworks |

## The Critical Insight

The Chousin are looking for something **GREATER** than themselves — a being that could have created THEM.

Sailor Cosmos is:
- From an entirely DIFFERENT cosmic framework (Sailor Moon universe)
- NOT greater than the Chousin in their dimensional hierarchy
- EXTERNAL to their creation
- Operating through a "son" placed in their universe

**This is outside their search parameters.**

## Implications for Our Story

| Scenario | Probability |
|----------|-------------|
| Mortal Washu detects anomaly | HIGH |
| Mortal Washu identifies source as "another goddess" | LOW |
| Full Chousin reunion notices Cosmos's fingerprints | MEDIUM |
| Chousin actively investigate external divine entity | LOW (not their focus) |
| Chousin become hostile to Sheldon | VERY LOW |

**LOCKED:** The Chousin's search for a being greater than themselves creates a blind spot for beings from EXTERNAL cosmic frameworks. Cosmos slipped her son into their universe through a gap in their awareness.

# FINDING 4: ZERO INFILTRATION MECHANICS

## What Canon Establishes

| Fact | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Zero copied appearance, abilities, memories, emotions | Wiki | Perfect copy except gems |
| Zero couldn't duplicate Ryoko's gems | Wiki | Gems are unique/divine origin |
| Zero developed genuine feelings for Tenchi | Multiple | Emotions overwrote programming |
| Detection came via physical logo, not power sensing | Wiki | Dr. Clay's mark on buttocks |
| Infiltration lasted days successfully | Canon | Household didn't notice |
| Zero's powers matched Ryoko | Canon | No detectable difference |
| Zero eventually turned against Clay | Wiki | Copied loyalty to Tenchi |

## Detection Method

Washu noticed Zero during a **bath scene** when she saw Dr. Clay's logo tattooed on Zero's body. This was:
- Visual detection
- Physical evidence
- NOT power signature analysis
- NOT behavioral analysis

## Implications for Our Story

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Stable household | May notice behavioral inconsistencies faster |
| Sheldon's 12+ years with Ryoko | Knows her patterns intimately |
| "Aunt" dynamic vs "rival" dynamic | Different expected behaviors |
| Washu's investigation | Same detection method (physical) |

**PROBABILITY:** Sheldon might notice "Ryoko is acting differently" but would attribute it to stress, not replacement. Detection still relies on Washu's bath scene discovery.

# FINDING 5: YOSHO'S DELIBERATE PLAN

## What Canon Establishes

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| Yosho planned for Tenchi to release Ryoko | 101 Secrets |
| Made Tenchi curious about the cave | 101 Secrets |
| Kiyone helped bring young Tenchi near cave | FAQ |
| Knew Ryoko was watching Tenchi | 101 Secrets |
| Wanted Ryoko to experience childhood through Tenchi | Wiki |
| Believed this would change her for the better | Multiple |

## The 700-Year Rehabilitation Program

Yosho's plan:
1. Seal Ryoko (not kill her)
2. Allow her astral observation
3. Deliberately expose her to normal family life
4. Wait for her to develop empathy
5. Have Tenchi release her when ready
6. Let transformed Ryoko integrate into family

## Implications for Our Story

Sheldon's presence **enhances** Yosho's plan:
- 12 additional years of family observation
- Healthier family dynamic modeled
- More stable Tenchi for Ryoko to imprint on
- "Found family" concept demonstrated

**LOCKED:** Yosho's 700-year plan accounts for Ryoko's rehabilitation. Sheldon's presence is an unplanned enhancement that accelerates the intended outcome.

# FINDING 6: CANON TIMELINE SPECIFICS

## OVA 1 Events (Year 13 / 2001)

| Event | Canon Timing | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Tenchi enters cave | Summer (school vacation) | Deliberately disobeys |
| Breaks seal | Same day | Touches sealing stone |
| Ryoko awakens | Immediately | Enraged, attacks |
| Attack on school | Next day | Ryoko pursues Tenchi |
| Ryoko moves in | Within days | Decides to stay |
| Ayeka/Sasami arrive | Shortly after | Seeking Yosho |
| Space battle | Same day as arrival | Ryu-Oh vs Ryo-Ohki |
| Mihoshi crashes | Shortly after | GP investigation |
| Kagato arrives | Months later | Seeking Ryoko/Tsunami |
| Battle on Soja | Same arc | Tenchi manifests 3 LHW |
| Washu freed | After Kagato defeat | 5,000 years imprisoned |

## Key Timing Note

The Tenchi Wiki and 101 Secrets establish that Tenchi is 17 at OVA start, born approximately 1984. With story start April 1989, Tenchi is 4-5. Canon events begin when he's 17, making Year 13 (2001) the correct placement.

# FINDING 7: MARRIAGE AND JURAI POLITICS

## What Canon Establishes

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| Jurai allows polygamous marriages | Canon (Tenchi's seven wives) |
| Political marriages are common | Wiki |
| Yosho was engaged to Ayeka | Canon |
| Yosho has been "missing" 700 years | Canon |
| First Queen Funaho is from Earth | Canon |
| Earth-human marriages precedented | Funaho example |

## Implications for Sheldon-Yosho Marriage

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Can Yosho marry a non-Juraian? | Yes (precedent: Funaho) |
| Would it be politically significant? | Yes (Crown Prince returns) |
| Would Jurai accept male spouse? | Unknown — no canon example |
| Would children be recognized? | Probably (Cosmos's intervention) |

**NOTE:** Same-sex marriage in Juraian culture is not addressed in canon. This requires extrapolation or authorial decision.

---

# RESEARCH GAPS REMAINING

| Topic | Status | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Jurai same-sex marriage precedent | No canon data | MEDIUM |
| Exact episode timing within Year 13 | Approximate | LOW |
| Washu's first words to household | Need episode review | LOW |
| Ryoko's exact attack pattern on school | Need episode review | LOW |

---

# SUMMARY: LOCKED DECISIONS FROM RESEARCH

1. **Ryoko observed Sheldon for 12 years** via astral projection
2. **Washu WILL detect anomaly** but NOT identify Cosmos
3. **Chousin have blind spot** for external cosmic frameworks
4. **Zero detection unchanged** (physical marking method)
5. **Yosho's plan enhanced** by Sheldon's presence
6. **Year 13 (2001)** confirmed for canon events start
7. **Marriage precedent exists** for Earth-human spouses
