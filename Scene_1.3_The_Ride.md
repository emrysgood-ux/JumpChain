# SON OF COSMOS: JUMPCHAIN
## Scene 1.3: The Ride

**April 3, 1989 — ~15:15 JST**
**Location:** Kei Truck → Village Bus Stop
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

The cab of the kei truck smelled of earth and diesel and something faintly sweet—possibly the persimmons Sheldon could see in the rearview mirror, stacked in the wooden crates that filled the truck bed.

"Yamamoto Takeshi," the farmer said as he pulled back onto the road. "Everyone calls me Takeshi."

"Tsukino Sheldon." The name still felt strange in his mouth, but less strange than it had an hour ago. Perhaps he was already adapting. Perhaps that was how survival worked—you said the lie until it became true. "Most people call me Sheldon."

"Unusual name." Yamamoto didn't make it sound like a criticism. "American?"

"Yes."

"But the Tsukino family... they were Japanese, weren't they? I remember the old man—passed away maybe ten years ago. And his daughter, before her."

Sheldon hesitated. The wallet in his pocket contained documents that told a story he hadn't lived—a story of parents and grandparents, of a house inherited and a life waiting to be claimed. He didn't know how much of it was true. He didn't know if any of it was true.

"I don't know much about the family," he said carefully. "I was raised in America. The documents say I have a claim to the property, but I've never been here before."

It was technically true. He had never been to this place before—not in this life, not in the life before. Whatever memories the documents implied, whatever history they claimed, it was as foreign to him as the road they were driving down.

Yamamoto nodded slowly, as if this made sense to him. "It happens. Families scatter. People forget where they came from until someone dies and the lawyers start looking for heirs." He glanced at Sheldon. "The house has been empty a long time. Don't expect much."

"I'm not expecting anything."

"Good. That's the right attitude."

The road wound through a landscape that felt simultaneously familiar and alien. Rice paddies flooded with spring water, their surfaces reflecting the sky like shattered mirrors. Farmhouses with tile roofs and wooden walls, their gardens already showing the first green shoots of the season. Narrow paths leading off between bamboo groves, disappearing into shadows that seemed ancient.

Sheldon watched it all through the truck's window, cataloguing details, looking for something that might orient him. The architecture was older than he remembered from Kyoto—less modernization, more traditional construction. The farmers he saw wore work clothes that could have been from any decade, their faces weathered in ways that spoke of generations working the same land.

"The shrine," he said. "What's it like?"

Yamamoto considered the question. "Old. Very old. Masaki family has been there for... I don't know. Longer than anyone remembers. The current priest is good—strict but fair. Helps the village when he can."

"Just one priest?"

"Him and his family. His great-grandson lives with him—little boy, maybe four or five. Father works in Kurashiki, comes up on weekends." Yamamoto paused. "Good people. Private, but good."

Sheldon filed the information away. A priest, a child, a father who visited. A shrine that had been in the same family for generations. And a house nearby that had his name on the documents, waiting for someone to claim it.

The coincidences continued to multiply.

They drove for perhaps ten minutes, the road rising and falling with the terrain. The village came into view gradually—a cluster of buildings at the base of the mountains, traditional structures mixed with more modern additions. Sheldon saw a small shop with produce displayed outside, a post office, a building that might have been a community center.

Yamamoto pulled the truck to a stop beside a faded wooden shelter that marked the bus stop. A schedule was posted on the shelter's side, the characters worn but legible.

"The bus runs every hour during the day," Yamamoto said. "Next one should be..." he checked his watch, "about fifteen minutes. It goes up to the shrine—last stop on the route."

Sheldon reached for his wallet, but Yamamoto waved him off.

"No need. It was on my way." He looked at Sheldon with an expression that wasn't quite pity but wasn't quite distance either—something in between, something complicated. "If you're going to stay, you'll need to introduce yourself to the village council. Masaki-san can tell you how. He handles things like that."

"Masaki-san. The priest?"

"The same." Yamamoto smiled slightly. "He'll probably know you're coming before you get there. Word travels fast around here."

"I'll keep that in mind."

Sheldon climbed out of the truck, his legs steady on the hard-packed dirt. The afternoon sun was warm on his face, the air clean and sharp in a way that city air never managed. Somewhere in the distance, he could hear the same bird that had been calling in the field—three notes, questioning, patient.

"Thank you," he said, meaning it. "For the ride. For the information."

Yamamoto nodded, already shifting the truck back into gear. "Welcome to the village, Tsukino-san. I hope you find what you're looking for."

The truck pulled away, rattling down the road toward wherever Yamamoto's persimmons were destined. Sheldon watched it go until it disappeared around a bend, then turned to examine the bus stop.
