# DAY 2 — KATSUHITO POV — PART 1
## April 4, 1989 (Tuesday)
## Scenes 1-50: Pre-Dawn to Breakfast

---

**POV:** Masaki Katsuhito (Yosho Masaki Jurai)  
**Location Sequence:** Priest's Quarters → Shrine Grounds → Main House Kitchen → Garden Path → Main House  
**Weather:** Clear, 16°C high, 9°C low, light breeze from southwest  
**Sunrise:** 5:52 AM | **Sunset:** 6:26 PM

---

## SCENE 1: THE THIRD HOUR
**Time:** 03:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters, Masaki Shrine

The hour of the tiger. Katsuhito had not slept.

Seven hundred and twenty-seven years of life had taught him the rhythms of rest his body required. Four hours every third night, supplemented by the deep meditation techniques Funaho had taught him before Earth had become his prison. Sufficient for a Juraian physiology, even one as diluted by the intervening centuries as his own had become.

But tonight the meditation had failed him.

The young man slept in the guest quarters below. The one who called himself Sheldon Tsukino. The one whose appearance yesterday had disrupted the careful equilibrium Katsuhito had maintained for seven decades.

He sat in seiza on the tatami of his private quarters, the room lit only by starlight through the paper screens. His elderly disguise rippled at the edges of his perception—the illusion barrier that had hidden his true appearance from mortal eyes for generations. He could feel it like a second skin, so familiar now that maintaining it required no conscious effort.

The man below had seen through it.

Not entirely. Not consciously. But there had been moments during yesterday's dinner when Sheldon's gaze had lingered too long, had tracked movements that should have been invisible to an untrained eye. The young man had noticed something. Had filed it away for later consideration with the patient thoroughness of a trained observer.

What was he?

---

## SCENE 2: MEDITATION FAILURE
**Time:** 03:04:22 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters

Katsuhito attempted the breathing pattern once more.

In through the nose for seven counts. Hold for four. Out through the mouth for eight. The rhythm that had centered him through centuries of exile, through the death of wives and children and grandchildren, through the long watches while Ryoko slumbered in her prison beneath his feet.

His mind refused to settle.

The young man's arrival had too many coincidences. The date—April third—aligned with a turning of the celestial calendar that had significance in three separate divination systems. The timing—precisely when Tenchi had begun asking questions about his heritage that Katsuhito could not answer. The method—appearing on the mountain path without any record of his approach, without any warning from the subtle wards that should have detected his presence miles away.

The wards had detected nothing. As if Sheldon Tsukino had materialized from empty air.

Katsuhito had known only one power capable of such a feat. And that power lay sealed in the cave beneath the shrine, bound by his own sword and seven centuries of accumulated prayer.

The young man bore no trace of Ryoko's energy. He had checked, subtly, during dinner. The space demon's signature was unmistakable to anyone who had spent centuries in proximity to it.

So. Not Ryoko's doing.

What then?

---

## SCENE 3: THE TREE'S WHISPER
**Time:** 03:12:07 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters, near window

He rose and moved to the window.

Outside, the first tree of Jurai stood in the clearing before the shrine. Funaho—his mother's namesake, his companion through exile, the only connection to his homeworld that he had permitted himself to keep. The great cedar's branches moved in wind that had nothing to do with Earth's atmosphere, responding to currents of energy that flowed through the dimensional fabric between worlds.

He pressed his palm to the window frame and extended his awareness through the wood.

*Grandfather.*

The tree's response came as it always did—not words but impressions, emotions, the vast ancient patience of a consciousness that measured time in millennia rather than moments.

*The new presence disturbs you.*

Katsuhito formed his response carefully. The tree's communication was imprecise at the best of times, filtered through biological processes that had evolved on a world thousands of light-years distant.

*What do you sense from him?*

Silence. Then—

*Light. Old light. Folded light.*

The impression carried overtones he couldn't interpret. Funaho's perceptions didn't map cleanly onto human concepts.

*Is he a threat?*

*Unknown. The light is... patient. Waiting.*

---

## SCENE 4: ASSESSING THREAT VECTORS
**Time:** 03:18:44 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters

Katsuhito withdrew from the communion and settled onto his heels.

The tree's assessment aligned with his own instincts. Sheldon Tsukino did not behave like a threat—not in any of the ways Katsuhito had learned to recognize over centuries of guardianship. No aggression. No covert interest in the shrine's secrets. No questions that probed toward dangerous knowledge.

Instead, the young man had exhibited patience. Curiosity. A peculiar deference that suggested he understood himself to be a guest in territory governed by rules he didn't fully comprehend.

And the cooking.

Katsuhito had eaten food prepared by masters on two worlds. The Juraian imperial kitchens employed chefs who had trained for centuries in the preparation of dishes that sustained royal Tree-bonded physiology. Earth's culinary traditions, while simpler, had produced their own forms of excellence.

The meal Sheldon had prepared yesterday transcended both.

Something in that food had registered at a level beyond taste. An energy signature so subtle that Katsuhito had almost missed it—would have missed it, if not for the heightened sensitivity that came from seven centuries of proximity to Funaho's emanations.

The food had carried blessing.

---

## SCENE 5: THE MEMORY OF FUNAHO'S COOKING
**Time:** 03:25:17 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters

The observation triggered an association he had not permitted himself in decades.

His mother. Funaho. Not the tree—the woman. The Earthling who had captured his father's heart and ascended to become First Queen of Jurai. She had possessed no royal blood, no Tree bond, no power save the inexplicable something that had allowed her to survive the dimensional transition from Earth to Jurai's capital.

She had cooked for him, in those early years. Before the responsibilities of queenship had consumed her time completely. Simple dishes from her homeland—miso soup, rice porridge, pickled vegetables—prepared in palace kitchens that had never seen such humble ingredients.

The food had carried the same quality. That indefinable sense of care made manifest, of intention woven into sustenance.

Sheldon's cooking had reminded him of his mother.

The recognition disturbed him in ways he couldn't articulate.

---

## SCENE 6: EARLY PATROL DECISION
**Time:** 03:31:28 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters

Katsuhito stood.

Sleep would not come. Better to use the hours productively.

The shrine's wards required daily maintenance—small adjustments to compensate for the natural degradation that afflicted any spiritual structure maintained through mortal effort rather than Tree-sustained permanence. The work usually waited until after dawn prayers, but the pre-dawn hours would serve as well.

And the patrol route would take him past the guest quarters.

He was not spying. He was performing his duties as guardian of this place. If those duties happened to provide opportunity to observe the mysterious stranger during his unguarded moments, well. Vigilance was a virtue.

---

## SCENE 7: DRESSING FOR PATROL
**Time:** 03:35:42 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters

He moved through the familiar ritual of dressing.

The priest's robes hung where they always hung—white kosode beneath, pale blue hakama, the formal dark outer robe that marked his station. Each piece had been replaced dozens of times over the decades as fabric wore through, but the style remained constant. The image the village expected of its shrine keeper.

Beneath the robes, his body belied the elderly disguise. Muscle still moved smoothly under skin that should have shown the papery thinness of advanced age. His joints articulated without the protests that genuine decrepitude would have brought. The illusion barrier concealed this too—made his movements appear stiff and cautious even when they were neither.

A performance maintained so long it had become habit.

---

## SCENE 8: THE BOKKEN QUESTION
**Time:** 03:40:15 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters, weapon storage

His hand paused over the bokken rack.

The training swords occupied the corner where they had rested for decades—the implements of the style he taught to those few students the village occasionally produced. Simple wooden forms, their edges worn smooth by generations of practice.

He did not need a weapon for the patrol. The wards themselves would alert him to any danger long before physical force became necessary. And against any mundane threat—wild animals, the occasional drunken villager who wandered too far up the mountain—his body was weapon enough despite its apparent age.

But old habits died hard. And if Sheldon Tsukino was something other than he appeared...

Katsuhito selected a bokken. The weight felt comfortable in his grip, familiar as his own bones. He tucked it through his obi at an angle that would appear ceremonial rather than threatening.

Armed with wood. The irony would have made his sword-spirit laugh, had Tenchi-ken possessed a sense of humor.

---

## SCENE 9: DEPARTING THE QUARTERS
**Time:** 03:44:33 JST  
**Location:** Priest's quarters exterior

The night air held the particular chill of mountain spring.

Katsuhito breathed deeply as he stepped onto the engawa. The scents came to him layered and distinct—cedar from the great tree, moss from the courtyard stones, the faint mineral tang of the spring that fed the shrine's purification basin. Underneath it all, the subtle wrongness that had lingered since yesterday.

Not wrongness exactly. Difference. An addition to the familiar olfactory landscape of the place he had guarded for so long.

Sheldon Tsukino smelled like nothing Katsuhito had encountered before.

No. That wasn't quite right either. The young man smelled human enough—soap, sleep-sweat, the particular biochemistry of a body that had recently consumed rice and vegetables and tea. But beneath those ordinary scents lay something else. Something that reminded Katsuhito of starlight filtered through atmosphere, of the particular frequency of cosmic radiation that reached Earth's surface during certain celestial alignments.

Old light, Funaho had said. Folded light.

What had folded it?

---

## SCENE 10: THE SHRINE APPROACH
**Time:** 03:48:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main courtyard

The gravel of the courtyard crunched beneath his sandals.

Katsuhito kept his steps deliberately audible. The appearance of age required certain accommodations—an elderly priest would not move in silence across his own grounds. The illusion had to extend beyond sight to encompass all the details that an observer might notice.

Not that any observer was likely at this hour. The village below slept. The mountain's other inhabitants—deer, tanuki, the occasional wild boar—would have registered his presence already and begun their withdrawals.

Still. Habits.

The main shrine building rose before him, its roof line cutting a familiar shape against the star-scattered sky. The structure dated to the Meiji era in its current form, though the site had been sacred for far longer than that. Katsuhito had overseen three major reconstructions during his tenure, each time preserving the essential character while updating the materials that time had degraded.

The building itself held no power. It was the land beneath that mattered—the ley lines that converged here, the dimensional thin-spot that had allowed a crippled Juraian ship to make landfall seven centuries ago. The structure was merely a marker, a human framework imposed on forces that predated human presence on this island.

---

## SCENE 11: WARD INSPECTION — EASTERN BOUNDARY
**Time:** 03:52:41 JST  
**Location:** Eastern torii, boundary marker

The first ward station occupied the eastern approach.

Katsuhito paused beneath the smaller torii that marked this entrance. The gate stood perhaps eight feet tall—unpainted cedar, the same wood as Funaho's trunk, a conscious choice that linked the boundary markers to the tree's protective influence. He pressed his palm to the right pillar and extended his awareness into the wood.

The ward responded sluggishly. Expected—the natural degradation he'd risen early to address. He fed a trickle of energy into the structure, reinforcing the spiritual fabric that the gate anchored.

The work required concentration. His mind necessarily narrowed to the immediate task—the precise calibration of power needed to strengthen without overloading, the delicate adjustment of frequency that kept the ward harmonized with its companions.

When he withdrew his hand, the eastern boundary felt solid again.

One down. Eleven more before dawn.

---

## SCENE 12: WARD INSPECTION — SOUTHEASTERN BOUNDARY
**Time:** 04:01:33 JST  
**Location:** Southeastern stone marker

The southeastern station was a buried stone rather than a gate.

Katsuhito knelt on the dew-damp grass and pressed both palms to the earth. The marker lay three feet below the surface—a boulder carved with characters that had been ancient before Japan's recorded history. The original residents of these islands had known something about the convergence here. Their marks remained, incorporated into the ward structure he had built atop their foundation.

This one required more work.

The stone had shifted slightly during the spring thaw—a matter of millimeters, but enough to degrade the ward's effectiveness by perhaps ten percent. He adjusted his energy output, coaxing the spiritual structure to compensate for the physical displacement.

The effort cost him. Not significantly—his reserves remained more than adequate—but noticeably. Another reminder that even Juraian longevity had limits. His power had diminished over the centuries, the slow attrition of a physiology cut off from its Tree bond.

Funaho sustained him to some degree. But she was not his tree. That bond remained possible only through Tenchi-ken, and the sword lay sealed in the cave with Ryoko.

He had chosen exile over power. Some days the choice felt less wise than others.

---

## SCENE 13: WARD INSPECTION — SOUTHERN APPROACH
**Time:** 04:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Southern path, main village approach

The southern ward guarded the primary approach from the village.

This gate was the largest of the boundary markers—the public face of the shrine's spiritual protection. Villagers passed beneath it on festival days, touched its pillars for luck, taught their children to bow as they entered and exited sacred ground.

None of them knew what it actually did.

Katsuhito inspected the structure with particular care. This ward had the most traffic, the most exposure to the unintentional energy that human beings shed as they moved through their lives. That energy accumulated on spiritual structures like dust on furniture, gradually obscuring the underlying power.

He cleaned it. The process resembled meditation more than physical labor—a focused intention that swept away the accumulated psychic debris without disrupting the ward's essential function. The work took seven minutes and left the gate humming at optimal effectiveness.

Sheldon had passed beneath this gate yesterday.

Katsuhito extended his awareness into the ward's memory—a limited function, capable of recording only the roughest impressions of recent traffic. The young man's passage appeared as a blur of... nothing. An absence where a signature should have been.

The wards had not detected him because there had been nothing to detect.

---

## SCENE 14: CONTEMPLATING THE ABSENCE
**Time:** 04:23:15 JST  
**Location:** Southern gate, standing position

Katsuhito remained beneath the gate, turning the observation over in his mind.

Every living being shed energy. Every conscious entity left traces on the spiritual structures they encountered. Even the most disciplined practitioners—Shinto priests who had spent decades learning to move without disturbance, monks whose meditation had refined their presence to nearly nothing—still registered as something when they passed through warded space.

Sheldon Tsukino had registered as absence.

Not the absence of a void or a predator—Katsuhito had encountered such things, entities that consumed rather than shed energy. Those left their own signatures, distinctive in their negative space.

This was different. Sheldon had passed through the ward without touching it. As if he had walked a path that ran parallel to the physical gate but separate from its spiritual counterpart.

Such a feat should have been impossible for anyone without dimensional folding capability. And dimensional folding required either Tree-level power or technology so advanced that it might as well be magic.

The young man who cooked sublime meals and asked permission before using the bathroom did not exhibit the bearing of someone who commanded such resources.

Which meant either Sheldon didn't know what he was, or his act was far more sophisticated than Katsuhito had assumed.

---

## SCENE 15: DECISION TO OBSERVE MORE CLOSELY
**Time:** 04:27:44 JST  
**Location:** Southern gate

The wind shifted.

From the southwest now, carrying hints of the sea that lay beyond the mountain range. Katsuhito let it pass over him, feeling the natural energy that rode the air currents. No anomalies. No disturbances. Whatever Sheldon Tsukino was, his presence hadn't disrupted the broader spiritual ecology of the shrine.

A good sign. Perhaps.

Or a sign that his concealment was comprehensive enough to hide even secondary effects.

Katsuhito resumed his patrol. Six more ward stations awaited inspection, and dawn approached at its scheduled pace. The morning routine would begin in ninety minutes—prayers, breakfast preparation, the domestic rhythms that a household with a small child required.

Sheldon would wake soon. Would engage with those rhythms, integrate himself further into the patterns of shrine life.

Katsuhito would watch. Would gather data. Would wait for the young man's mask to slip, as all masks eventually did.

Seven centuries had taught him patience. He could afford to take his time.

---

## SCENE 16: WARD INSPECTION — SOUTHWESTERN BOUNDARY
**Time:** 04:35:18 JST  
**Location:** Southwestern hillside, forest marker

The southwestern station was hidden among the trees.

This ward protected against approach from the undeveloped slopes—the direction from which wild animals were most likely to wander into shrine precincts. Katsuhito navigated the underbrush with the ease of long familiarity, his sandals finding the same path they had found ten thousand times before.

The marker here was a small stone shrine, waist-high, sheltered beneath the spreading branches of a maple that had been young when he'd arrived on Earth. The tree had grown around the shrine over the centuries, its roots now partially embracing the stone base.

He knelt and performed the inspection.

This ward had suffered less degradation than the others—its forest position protected it from the heaviest human traffic, and the tree's presence provided natural shielding. A minor adjustment sufficed.

As he worked, a tanuki watched from the shadows.

The animal recognized him. They all did, after so long. The shrine's wildlife had developed what amounted to generational memory regarding the old priest who never quite acted like an old priest, who moved through their territory with the ease of a fellow creature rather than the blundering of most humans.

He acknowledged the tanuki with a slight nod.

The animal chittered once, then disappeared into the brush.

---

## SCENE 17: THE TANUKI EXCHANGE
**Time:** 04:41:02 JST  
**Location:** Southwestern forest, near maple

Katsuhito paused before continuing his patrol.

The tanuki's behavior had been typical—recognition, brief acknowledgment, departure. But the timing triggered an association.

Tenchi loved tanuki. Had loved them since he was old enough to toddle after the shrine's wildlife on unsteady legs. The boy had given names to at least a dozen of the creatures over the years, maintaining conversations with them as if they could understand his words. Perhaps they could. Children often perceived things that adults had learned to filter out.

The boy would turn five in twenty days. Another birthday without his mother. Another year of questions Katsuhito could not answer.

*Why can't I see Mama? Where did she go? Grandpa, will you go away too?*

The questions had started after Kiyone's death. Three years old and suddenly aware of impermanence in ways no child should have to face. Katsuhito had answered as best he could—with partial truths, with evasions, with the desperate hope that time would soften the loss before understanding could sharpen it.

Tenchi had stopped asking about his mother. Had started asking about everything else instead. Why did things die? Why did people leave? What made someone stay?

Sheldon's arrival would add new questions to the collection.

---

## SCENE 18: THE WEIGHT OF QUESTIONS
**Time:** 04:46:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between southwestern and western boundaries

The forest path wound upward toward the western station.

Katsuhito walked slowly, letting the pre-dawn darkness and the familiar terrain settle his thoughts. The conversation with himself—the constant internal dialogue that had been his primary companionship for centuries—required moments of deliberate silence to function properly.

What should he tell Tenchi about Sheldon?

The official story was simple enough. A distant cousin, newly arrived, requiring accommodation while he established himself. The Tsukino family connection provided sufficient cover for the village, and Tenchi was young enough to accept the explanation without pressing for details.

But the boy noticed things. Had noticed things about his grandfather that Katsuhito had hoped would remain unobserved for years yet. The wrong word, the wrong observation from Tenchi, and Sheldon might start asking questions of his own.

Assuming Sheldon didn't already know more than he was revealing.

---

## SCENE 19: WARD INSPECTION — WESTERN BOUNDARY
**Time:** 04:52:17 JST  
**Location:** Western ravine, bridge marker

The western ward protected the ravine crossing.

A narrow wooden bridge spanned the gap—forty feet of carefully maintained planking over a drop that would prove fatal to any unaugmented human who misstimed their footing. The ward here served dual purposes: spiritual protection for the boundary and physical warning for anyone approaching without proper respect.

Katsuhito stepped onto the bridge and pressed his palm to the main support beam.

The ward's condition surprised him. Instead of the expected degradation, the structure hummed with unexpected vitality. As if something had fed it recently.

He extended his awareness deeper, searching for the source.

There. A thread of energy that didn't match his own signature. Subtle. Almost invisible. The kind of contribution that might result from someone passing through with significant power who hadn't learned to shield their emissions.

Sheldon had walked this bridge yesterday evening.

---

## SCENE 20: ANALYZING THE RESIDUE
**Time:** 04:57:44 JST  
**Location:** Western bridge

Katsuhito remained on the bridge, parsing the energy signature.

The young man's contribution to the ward was unconscious—that much was clear. No trained practitioner would have left such obvious traces. But the quality of the energy itself...

Light. Old light. Folded light.

Funaho's words returned with new significance. The energy felt ancient despite its fresh deposit, as if it carried temporal weight disproportionate to the young man who had shed it. Not Juraian. Not the Light Hawk Wings that ran in Tenchi's bloodline, waiting to awaken. Something else. Something that predated both.

The discovery should have alarmed him. Instead, Katsuhito felt only curiosity.

Whatever Sheldon was, his power operated to strengthen rather than undermine. The ward had absorbed his unconscious contribution and integrated it seamlessly into the existing structure. As if the energy was compatible. As if it belonged.

---

## SCENE 21: REVISED THREAT ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 05:02:18 JST  
**Location:** Western bridge

Katsuhito withdrew his hand from the support beam.

His initial classification of Sheldon as a potential threat required adjustment. The evidence suggested something more complex—a being of significant power who operated without apparent awareness of that power, whose unconscious emissions enhanced rather than disrupted the spiritual structures around him.

Such beings existed in the myths of multiple worlds. Incarnations of cosmic principles. Sleeper agents of benevolent forces. Champions chosen before they knew they had been chosen.

The young man cooking breakfast in the shrine below might belong to any of these categories.

Or he might be something unprecedented. Something outside the frameworks Katsuhito had spent centuries developing.

The uncertainty was exquisite. After so long with nothing but familiar patterns, a genuine mystery felt almost like a gift.

---

## SCENE 22: WARD INSPECTION — NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY
**Time:** 05:08:33 JST  
**Location:** Northwestern cliff edge

The northwestern station clung to the cliff face.

This was the most dangerous of the boundary positions—a narrow ledge above a five-hundred-foot drop to the valley floor. The ward here protected against threats that might approach from the air, though such threats had not materialized in centuries.

Katsuhito navigated the approach with automatic precision. His apparent age would have made this traverse impossible for a genuine octogenarian. The illusion barrier strained slightly at the contradiction—the need to appear frail while executing movements that required strength and balance.

He reached the marker stone and performed the inspection quickly.

This ward had degraded slightly more than expected. The exposure to wind and weather accelerated the natural entropy of spiritual structures. He spent extra time reinforcing it, ensuring the aerial boundary remained secure.

As he worked, the first hint of gray touched the eastern horizon.

---

## SCENE 23: DAWN APPROACH
**Time:** 05:22:07 JST  
**Location:** Northwestern cliff edge

The valley below began to emerge from darkness.

Katsuhito allowed himself a moment of stillness before continuing the patrol. The view from this position had been one of his earliest comforts upon arriving on Earth—a landscape so different from Jurai's manicured gardens that it had felt like freedom rather than exile.

Seven centuries later, the view remained beautiful.

The village lay nestled in the valley's fold, perhaps three hundred structures housing perhaps eight hundred souls. He knew them all by name. Knew their lineages stretching back to the families who had lived here when he'd arrived. Knew the patterns of their lives, the rhythms of their celebrations and mournings, the slow accumulation of generations.

They knew him as Katsuhito. As the shrine keeper. As the old man who had always been old, whose predecessor (his own previous identity) had passed the role to him in a transition none of them questioned because none of them remembered anything different.

Memory was malleable. Truth was what people agreed to believe.

---

## SCENE 24: THE VILLAGE'S SHELDON PROBLEM
**Time:** 05:27:44 JST  
**Location:** Northwestern cliff edge

The village would need an explanation for Sheldon's presence.

Katsuhito had introduced the young man as a distant relative of the Tsukino family. The story would hold for the initial period—strangers arrived occasionally, relatives appeared from distant cities, the modern world's mobility had normalized such appearances.

But Sheldon intended to stay. To renovate the Tsukino house. To establish himself as a permanent resident of the valley.

That required integration. And integration required details that Katsuhito had not yet fully prepared.

Birth records. Family history. Educational credentials. Employment background. All the documentation that Japanese bureaucracy demanded of its citizens. Sheldon possessed none of it—or rather, possessed whatever he had brought with him from whatever existence he'd occupied before appearing on the mountain path.

The young man had mentioned this himself, during their dinner conversation. Had asked, indirectly, how such matters might be addressed.

Katsuhito had connections. Decades of careful cultivation had produced a network of individuals who owed him favors, who could produce documents that would satisfy official scrutiny. But using those connections would require explanations of his own.

Another complication in an increasingly complicated situation.

---

## SCENE 25: COMPLETING THE NORTHWESTERN INSPECTION
**Time:** 05:33:18 JST  
**Location:** Path from northwestern boundary

Katsuhito turned from the cliff edge and began the descent.

Five ward stations remained—northern, northeastern, the three interior positions that protected the shrine building itself. The work would take another forty minutes, bringing him to the edge of the morning routine's beginning.

He moved efficiently now, the meditative quality of the earlier inspections replaced by focused attention to task. The sun would rise soon. Sheldon would wake. The day's observations would begin in earnest.

---

## SCENE 26: WARD INSPECTION — NORTHERN BOUNDARY
**Time:** 05:38:44 JST  
**Location:** Northern ridge, standing stone

The northern ward marked the mountain's shoulder.

A standing stone here—one of the few pre-existing markers that had survived from the island's earliest inhabitants. Katsuhito had incorporated it into his ward structure rather than replacing it, respecting the power that had accumulated in the stone over millennia of indigenous worship.

The inspection revealed no significant degradation.

The northern approach saw little traffic. The terrain was too steep, the path too treacherous for casual visitors. Only the most determined pilgrims climbed this way, and those individuals usually possessed sufficient spiritual sensitivity that their presence benefited rather than drained the wards.

---

## SCENE 27: WARD INSPECTION — NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY  
**Time:** 05:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Northeastern grove, twin stones

The northeastern station occupied a grove of ancient cryptomeria.

Two standing stones here, placed in deliberate opposition by hands long returned to dust. The ward they anchored protected against approach from the neighboring prefecture—a direction that had once posed political threat when daimyo boundaries meant something more than administrative convenience.

Katsuhito inspected both stones in sequence.

The first required minor reinforcement. The second held strong, its deeper roots in the spiritual landscape providing natural resilience.

As he worked, the sky continued to lighten. Birds began their morning calls—the bush warbler's distinctive song, the chirping of sparrows, the occasional harsh cry of a crow asserting territorial claims.

The sounds were Earth sounds. After so long, they felt more like home than the synthesized harmonies of Jurai's royal gardens.

---

## SCENE 28: INTERIOR WARD — OUTER SHRINE GROUNDS
**Time:** 05:52:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main courtyard, inner torii

The first interior ward protected the transition from outer to inner precincts.

This torii was smaller than the public gate, its wood polished smooth by generations of passing hands. Shrine visitors passed beneath it during formal occasions—New Year, the spring and autumn equinoxes, the summer and winter solstices that the villagers had incorporated into their agricultural calendar.

Katsuhito touched the right pillar and found the ward at expected levels.

The interior positions required less maintenance than the perimeter stations. Protected from weather and traffic, insulated by the outer defenses, they served more as backup than primary protection.

---

## SCENE 29: INTERIOR WARD — MAIN HALL APPROACH
**Time:** 05:56:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main hall, front steps

The second interior ward guarded the main hall's entrance.

This was the heart of the public shrine—the space where worshippers offered prayers, where weddings and funerals conducted their rituals, where the accumulated devotion of generations had left its mark on the spiritual fabric.

The ward here felt healthy. Almost too healthy—as if recent devotional activity had fed it beyond normal levels.

Katsuhito paused, considering.

Tenchi had been praying more frequently lately. The boy's natural sensitivity, combined with his unawakened power, meant that his sincere petitions carried weight disproportionate to his age. His prayers for his mother, for his father, for his grandfather's continued presence—these had apparently strengthened the ward structure.

A gift. And a complication. Tenchi's power would need to be trained eventually. But not yet. Not until the boy was old enough to understand what he was.

---

## SCENE 30: INTERIOR WARD — INNER SANCTUM
**Time:** 06:02:18 JST  
**Location:** Shrine inner sanctum, sacred space

The third and final interior ward protected the inner sanctum.

This space was forbidden to public access—the room behind the main altar where artifacts of genuine power resided. Katsuhito entered through the side passage, ducking beneath the low lintel that forced visitors to bow whether they intended to or not.

The sanctum held several items of significance. A mirror that had belonged to a Heian-era empress, polished silver that still reflected true despite its age. A sword—not Tenchi-ken, but a blade forged by a master smith who had possessed unexpected sensitivity to spiritual frequencies. A collection of ancient texts in languages that no living scholar could read.

And the key to Ryoko's prison. Hidden among the other artifacts, unremarkable in appearance, devastating in function.

Katsuhito inspected the ward protecting these treasures. Secure. Undisturbed. No trace of curious investigation from their new houseguest.

A relief. And an observation worth noting.

---

## SCENE 31: SANCTUM REFLECTION
**Time:** 06:08:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine inner sanctum

Katsuhito lingered in the sanctum.

The coming day would bring challenges he could not fully anticipate. Sheldon's presence had introduced variables into a system that had run on predictable patterns for decades. The equilibrium he had maintained—between guardianship and concealment, between duty and desire, between the weight of his past and the demands of his present—now faced disruption.

He should resent the intrusion.

Instead, he found himself curious.

Seven hundred years of accumulated caution urged him toward suspicion. But something else—something that might have been hope, or perhaps merely the relief of novelty—pushed back against the caution's weight.

Whatever Sheldon was, he was something new. And after so long with only the familiar, new felt precious.

---

## SCENE 32: DEPARTING THE SANCTUM
**Time:** 06:12:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine inner sanctum, exit passage

Katsuhito sealed the sanctum behind him.

The pre-dawn patrol was complete. All twelve ward stations had been inspected and reinforced. The shrine's defenses stood ready for whatever the day might bring.

Now came the domestic portion of the morning. Prayers. Breakfast. The careful management of a household that had grown by one.

He moved toward the main house, his sandals finding the familiar path without conscious direction.

## SCENE 33: OBSERVING THE MAIN HOUSE
**Time:** 06:15:44 JST  
**Location:** Path between shrine and main house

The main house sat in quiet darkness.

No lights yet. No sound of movement. Sheldon and Tenchi both still slept, wrapped in the unconsciousness that mortal bodies required.

Katsuhito paused at the garden gate, assessing.

The house had sheltered his family for three generations now. His daughter Kiyone had grown up within its walls. His grandson Tenchi was growing still. The building held memories layered deep—laughter and tears, celebrations and mournings, the accumulated life of decades.

Sheldon would add his own layer now. His presence would write itself into the house's history, becoming part of the story this place told.

Katsuhito found he did not object to this.

---

## SCENE 34: ENTERING THE MAIN HOUSE
**Time:** 06:19:22 JST  
**Location:** Main house, engawa entrance

The engawa boards creaked beneath his weight.

A deliberate creak—the house had been designed to announce arrivals, a security feature from an era when unannounced visitors might mean danger. Katsuhito could have moved silently if he'd chosen. He didn't choose.

The interior hallway stretched before him, its darkness beginning to gray as pre-dawn light filtered through the shoji screens. He removed his sandals at the entrance, placed them precisely in their designated spot, and stepped onto the polished wood of the floor.

The house smelled of sleep and cedar and the lingering traces of last night's dinner.

Sheldon's cooking. That remarkable food that had carried blessing without the young man appearing to know it.

---

## SCENE 35: MORNING PREPARATION BEGINS
**Time:** 06:23:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The kitchen awaited.

Katsuhito moved through it with the efficiency of long practice. Water for tea. Rice for the cooker. Vegetables from the cold storage that would become miso soup once cut and simmered. The morning routine asserted itself, muscle memory overriding the thoughts that still circled around their new houseguest.

He worked quietly, not wishing to wake the sleepers before necessary. Tenchi needed rest—the boy had spent yesterday processing a stranger's arrival, a task that exhausted children in ways adults often forgot. Sheldon needed rest for reasons Katsuhito couldn't fully articulate but nonetheless sensed.

The young man carried something. Some weight. Some burden that sleep might help him shoulder.

---

## SCENE 36: RICE PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:27:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The rice required washing.

Katsuhito measured three cups of the short-grain rice that the village's cooperative grew in the valley paddies. Local produce for local tables—one of the small satisfactions of living in a place where food still connected to the land that produced it.

He poured the rice into the washing bowl and began the rhythmic motion. Cold water in. Gentle swirling. Water out, cloudy with starch. Repeat until the water ran clear.

The meditation inherent in the task settled his thoughts.

Whatever Sheldon was, the young man would wake hungry. Would eat whatever breakfast Katsuhito prepared. Would continue the process of integration that had begun yesterday. The domestic rhythms would assert themselves, and observation would continue.

Patience. The situation called for patience.

---

## SCENE 37: TEA WATER HEATING
**Time:** 06:33:18 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The kettle began its climb toward boiling.

Katsuhito watched the water through the kettle's small window, tracking the progression from still to trembling to rolling. The process was the same every morning—a constant in a life that had seen too few constants.

He thought about Kiyone.

His daughter had loved morning tea. Had insisted on a specific preparation method that she'd learned from her mother's mother, a woman Katsuhito had known only through the reverence his wife had carried for her memory. Steep for exactly two minutes. No more, no less.

Kiyone had been dead for three years now. Tenchi had been two when she'd passed.

The boy remembered nothing of his mother. Would remember nothing except what Katsuhito told him, what Nobuyuki shared during his occasional visits, what the photographs displayed throughout the house could convey.

Another loss in a lifetime of losses.

---

## SCENE 38: VEGETABLE PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:38:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The vegetables needed cutting.

Daikon from the cold room. Wakame seaweed, reconstituting in a bowl of water. Green onions from the garden plot that Katsuhito maintained behind the house. Tofu, firm-packed, awaiting its cube transformation.

He retrieved the knife—a good blade, German steel, a gift from Nobuyuki after one of his son-in-law's business trips abroad. The handle had worn to fit his grip over years of use.

The cutting began.

Daikon into thin half-moons. Tofu into careful cubes. Green onion into precise rings. Each piece uniform, each cut efficient, the rhythm of the work familiar as breathing.

Sheldon had cut vegetables last night with similar precision. Different technique—the young man's training clearly came from different traditions—but the same underlying skill.

A point of connection. Small, but notable.

---

## SCENE 39: MISO PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The dashi stock had simmered overnight.

Katsuhito retrieved the pot from its back-burner position, checking the color and smell before proceeding. Good. Clear and slightly golden, the kombu and katsuobushi having done their work while the house slept.

He strained the stock through cheesecloth, discarding the solid ingredients that had surrendered their flavor. The liquid returned to a clean pot, ready for the morning's transformation.

Miso paste next. The red miso that the valley's oldest family still produced according to methods their ancestors had brought from Kyoto centuries ago. Katsuhito measured two tablespoons into a small bowl, then added a ladleful of warm dashi to begin the dissolution.

The technique mattered. Direct addition of miso to hot stock killed the beneficial cultures that made the paste worth eating. The intermediate step preserved what heat would destroy.

Small details. They accumulated into quality.

---

## SCENE 40: FIRST LIGHT
**Time:** 06:52:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The sun crested the eastern ridge.

Light poured through the kitchen window, transforming the space from gray to gold in the span of seconds. Katsuhito paused his work to acknowledge the moment—a habit so old he'd forgotten its origin.

Every sunrise was a gift. This remained true whether the observer had seen five thousand sunrises or five hundred thousand. The novelty never fully faded, even when the mechanics became perfectly familiar.

The light caught the steam rising from the pot, turning it to amber mist before it dissipated.

Beautiful. Everyday beautiful.

---

## SCENE 41: LISTENING FOR MOVEMENT
**Time:** 06:55:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The house creaked above.

Katsuhito's attention shifted upward, tracking the sound through the building's structure. The floorboards in the upstairs hallway—someone had risen. Heavy tread, adult weight, deliberate placement.

Sheldon.

The young man was awake.

Katsuhito continued his preparations, but his awareness now extended beyond the kitchen. He tracked the sounds of Sheldon's morning routine through the house's acoustic geography. Water in the upstairs bathroom. The slide of shoji screens. Footsteps approaching the stairs.

---

## SCENE 42: ANTICIPATING THE ENCOUNTER
**Time:** 06:58:33 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

Breakfast was nearly ready.

The miso soup simmered at a low temperature, its ingredients combined, its flavor developing. The rice cooker had clicked to "warm" ten minutes ago, its contents perfect and waiting. The tea sat in its pot, steeped to proper strength.

Katsuhito set the table for three. Tenchi would wake soon—the boy's internal clock operated with remarkable precision for a four-year-old. The three of them would share a meal, and Katsuhito would continue his observation.

Sheldon's footsteps descended the stairs.

---

## SCENE 43: THE MORNING GREETING
**Time:** 07:02:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen threshold

"Good morning, Katsuhito-san."

Sheldon stood in the kitchen doorway, dressed in the borrowed yukata he'd slept in, his expression carrying the particular softness of recent waking.

"Good morning, Sheldon-kun." Katsuhito allowed his voice to carry the warmth appropriate to a host greeting a welcome guest. "You slept well?"

"Better than I have in a long time." The young man's answer came with what appeared to be genuine surprise. "I didn't expect to sleep at all."

Interesting. Katsuhito filed the observation.

---

## SCENE 44: OFFERING ASSISTANCE
**Time:** 07:04:22 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

"May I help with breakfast?"

Sheldon had moved further into the kitchen, his attention on the preparations in progress. His eyes tracked the various elements—soup, rice, tea—with the assessment of someone who understood what they were seeing.

"The meal is nearly complete." Katsuhito gestured toward the table. "Please, sit. Tea will be ready momentarily."

"At least let me serve it." The offer carried no challenge, only the desire to contribute. "I feel useless just watching."

A fair sentiment. And useful for observation purposes.

"If you wish. The cups are in the cabinet to your right."

---

## SCENE 45: OBSERVING SHELDON'S MOVEMENTS
**Time:** 07:06:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

The young man moved with unexpected grace.

Katsuhito watched from his position at the stove as Sheldon retrieved the tea cups from the indicated cabinet. The motion was efficient—no wasted movement, no awkward adjustments. The young man's spatial awareness operated at a level that suggested either extensive training or unusual natural aptitude.

The cups were traditional—ceramic, made by an artisan in the next valley over. Sheldon handled them with appropriate care, arranging them on the small tray that lived beside the cabinet for exactly this purpose.

"The pot is on the counter behind you," Katsuhito said. "It will need to settle for another minute before pouring."

Sheldon nodded, his attention already on the pot in question.

---

## SCENE 46: THE TEA POURING
**Time:** 07:08:33 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

Sheldon poured the tea with precise control.

The motion was familiar—Katsuhito had seen similar technique in formal tea ceremonies, in the practiced hands of masters who had trained for decades to achieve exactly this smooth, unbroken stream. But Sheldon's version felt less formal. More... natural.

As if the technique arose from understanding rather than learning.

"You've studied tea preparation." Not a question.

Sheldon paused, the pot still tilted over the third cup. "I... think so. Parts of it feel familiar, even though I don't remember specific instruction."

Memory gaps. Another data point.

---

## SCENE 47: TENCHI STIRS
**Time:** 07:12:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen (sound from upstairs)

Small feet on the upstairs floor.

Katsuhito registered the sound immediately—the distinctive patter of a child waking and orienting himself to the day. Tenchi was up. Would need the bathroom. Would come downstairs hungry and hopefully in good spirits.

"Tenchi's awake," he said, more for Sheldon's benefit than his own. "He'll join us in a few minutes."

Sheldon set the teapot down, his expression shifting to something Katsuhito couldn't immediately identify. Anticipation? Anxiety? Both?

"I should get dressed properly before breakfast." The young man glanced down at his borrowed yukata. "If there's time."

"There is time. The bathroom upstairs is available—Tenchi uses the one downstairs in the morning."

---

## SCENE 48: SHELDON DEPARTS BRIEFLY
**Time:** 07:14:22 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

Sheldon excused himself with a bow that was almost correct.

Katsuhito noted the bow's form as the young man departed. The angle was appropriate—respectful without being obsequious. But the execution had a slight stiffness that suggested intellectual understanding without physical practice.

The young man knew how to bow. Had not spent years actually doing it.

Memory without muscle. Knowledge without embodiment.

Another piece of the puzzle.

---

## SCENE 49: TENCHI'S DESCENT
**Time:** 07:18:44 JST  
**Location:** Main house, stairs

"Grandpa! Good morning!"

Tenchi appeared at the bottom of the stairs, his sleep-yukata askew, his hair a disaster of bedhead that would require patient combing before the day could properly begin. The boy's energy was already building—the restless vitality that characterized his waking hours.

"Good morning, Ten-chan." Katsuhito opened his arms, and Tenchi barreled into them with the unselfconscious enthusiasm of childhood. "Did you sleep well?"

"I dreamed about flying." Tenchi's voice was muffled against his grandfather's robe. "I had big wings and I flew all the way to the ocean."

Dreams of flying. In a boy whose destiny included the Light Hawk Wings.

"That sounds like a good dream."

---

## SCENE 50: MORNING HAZE
**Time:** 07:22:17 JST  
**Location:** Main house, kitchen

Tenchi released himself from the hug and immediately focused on breakfast.

"Miso soup! And rice! Is there tamagoyaki?"

"Not today." Katsuhito guided his grandson toward the table. "But there will be tsukemono. And perhaps Sheldon-san will make something special again for dinner."

Tenchi's expression brightened further. "He cooks really good. Almost as good as you, Grandpa."

"I think perhaps better than me." The admission cost Katsuhito nothing—it was simply true. "He has skills I never developed."

"Can I help him cook sometime? Can I learn?"

"If Sheldon-san agrees, I see no reason why not."

The boy practically vibrated with anticipation.
