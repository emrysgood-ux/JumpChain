# GAP G: YEARS 26-100 — THE MISSING CENTURY
## Son of Cosmos: Building a Life Together
## Compiled December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

**Period:** Year 26 (2014) through Year 100 (2089)
**Sheldon's apparent age:** 22-25 (unchanging)
**Yosho's apparent age:** Whatever he chooses (typically 20s-30s now)

This is the heart of the story's "happily ever after" — but an active, living happily ever after spanning 75 years. Adventures continue, children are born and raised, the household evolves, and two immortals learn what forever actually means.

# PART 1: THE WEDDING (Year ~30)

## 1.1 — Why Year 30?

| Factor | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|
| Post-canon stabilization | Years 25-28 establish new normal |
| Village acknowledgment | Year 25 "We Know" speech clears the air |
| Sheldon's full recovery | 5 stable LHW by Year 25 |
| Emotional readiness | Both have processed the revelations |
| Practical timing | Household stable, children can attend |

The wedding happens approximately **Year 30 (2019)** — five years after the village acknowledgment, giving time for:
- The relationship to deepen openly
- Juraian traditions to be negotiated
- Family to prepare

## 1.2 — The Proposal (Year 29)

**Juraian tradition:** Ship-bond proposal. Yosho has his tree (Funaho) and Sheldon... doesn't have a tree.

**The adaptation:** Yosho proposes by offering to share his tree-bond. This is extraordinary — Juraian royalty bonding their tree to a non-Juraian is nearly unheard of.

**The moment:**
> Setting: The lake at sunset. Funaho's tree visible on the shore.
> 
> Yosho takes Sheldon's hand and presses it to Funaho's bark.
> 
> "In Juraian tradition, a proposal is an invitation to share one's tree. My tree has been alone with me for 700 years. She has agreed to accept you."
>
> The tree hums. Warm. Welcoming.
>
> "Will you?"

**Sheldon's response:** Not words. Just stepping forward and resting his forehead against the bark, tears streaming. Yes.

## 1.3 — The Ceremony

**Dual ceremony:** Juraian ship-bond ritual AND Earth legal marriage

**Juraian component:**
- Performed by Lady Seto (who travels for this)
- Witnessed by Funaho and Misaki (Yosho's mothers)
- Ayeka and Sasami participate as family
- The tree Funaho serves as altar/witness
- Sheldon formally joins House Masaki Jurai

**Earth component:**
- Legal marriage under Japanese law
- Sheldon takes "Masaki" name officially
- Small ceremony at the shrine
- Village witnesses (the few trusted)
- Nobuyuki gives a tearful blessing

**Guests:**
- All household members
- Yosho's Juraian family (those who know)
- Uncle Kiyoshi's family (from Osaka)
- Select villagers

**NOT present:**
- Emperor Azusa (political complications)
- Juraian court (kept private)

## 1.4 — Wedding Night and After

Not explicit — but meaningful.

For Yosho: First true partner since Kasumi died (centuries ago). First bond where he doesn't have to hide.

For Sheldon: First romantic relationship that isn't temporary. First time truly being *chosen*.

They spend a week at a private Juraian estate (gift from Seto). When they return, they're simply... married. No drama. No adjustment period. Just home.

# PART 2: MARRIED LIFE ESTABLISHED (Years 30-40)

## 2.1 — Living Arrangements

**Primary residence:** The Masaki compound
- Sheldon and Yosho share the traditional house
- Shrine duties continue
- Workshop/lab for Sheldon's projects

**Secondary residences:**
- Apartment in Kurashiki (for Nobuyuki visits, then later his care)
- Access to Juraian ships for travel
- The inherited Tsukino house (maintained for Osaka family visits)

## 2.2 — Daily Routine (Post-Wedding)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:30 AM | Yosho rises (habit); Sheldon follows |
| 6:00 AM | Meditation together (20 years of practice) |
| 6:30 AM | Breakfast (Sheldon cooks) |
| 7:00-12:00 | Shrine duties (Yosho) / Lab work (Sheldon) |
| 12:00 PM | Lunch together |
| 1:00-5:00 PM | Various — projects, visitors, household |
| 5:00 PM | Dinner preparation |
| 6:00 PM | Family dinner (whoever's home) |
| Evening | Reading, conversation, visitors, or quiet |
| 10:00 PM | Bed |

## 2.3 — Household Members (Year 30)

| Resident | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Sheldon | Full-time | Spouse, primary cook |
| Yosho | Full-time | Spouse, shrine priest |
| Tenchi | Part-time | Adult (21), university, visits regularly |
| Nobuyuki | Weekends | Aging, grateful |
| Ryoko | Full-time | Aunt energy; protective of household |
| Ayeka | Rotating | Splits time with Jurai; aunt energy |
| Sasami | Rotating | Growing up; learning to cook from Sheldon |
| Washu | Lab | Emerges for meals and chaos |
| Mihoshi | Assigned | GP liaison; disaster magnet |
| Kiyone Makibi | Assigned | GP partner to Mihoshi |
| Noike | Assigned | Later arrival; stabilizing presence |
| Ryo-Ohki | Everywhere | Cabbit; loves everyone |

## 2.4 — The "Aunt" Dynamic Solidified

By Year 30, the harem-to-found-family transformation is complete:

| Character | Relationship to Sheldon |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Ryoko | Protective older sister energy; respects him |
| Ayeka | Formal respect; growing warmth |
| Sasami | Cooking apprentice; adores him |
| Washu | Fascinated colleague; respects his intellect |
| Mihoshi | Genuinely loves his cooking; disaster-prone friendship |
| Kiyone M. | Professional respect; occasional exasperation |
| Noike | Steady alliance; household management partners |

None of them pursue Tenchi romantically anymore. They are family.

# PART 3: THE CHILDREN (Years 39-50+)

## 3.1 — First Child: Achika (Year 39 / 2028)

**The Surprise:**
Sheldon builds the Birthing Matrix as a surprise for Yosho. Reveals it on their 9th wedding anniversary.

> "I've been working on something. I wasn't sure it was possible, but..."
>
> *Shows Yosho the completed system.*
>
> "If you want... we could have a child. A child that's truly ours."

**Yosho's reaction:** Stunned. Then tears. Then holding Sheldon for a very long time.

**Gestation:** 
- 14-month Juraian-standard gestation
- Sheldon monitors everything
- Washu is informed AFTER gestation begins (observer, not participant)

**Birth:**
- Home birth at the shrine
- Washu attends (by her own insistence, wanting to witness)
- All household members wait outside
- A daughter. Healthy. Perfect.

**Name:** Achika — named after Tenchi's mother. Honoring the Kiyone who died before Sheldon arrived, and the mother-shaped hole in the family.

**Appearance:** 
- Dark hair (Yosho's genetics)
- Sheldon's eye shape
- Juraian features with hints of Sheldon's warmth

## 3.2 — Second Child: Mamoru (Year 41 / 2030)

**The collaboration:**
Washu ASKS to be involved this time. Not because she's needed — because she wants to learn from a system she didn't invent.

> "You built something I didn't think of. I want to understand it."

**Sheldon agrees:** This begins the ongoing collaboration.

**Birth:**
- Another home birth
- Easier second time
- A son.

**Name:** Mamoru (守) — "to protect"

**Appearance:**
- Pink hair (Usagi's genetics expressing through Cosmos's influence)
- This is the first visible sign of Sheldon's cosmic heritage
- Neither parent expected it; both find it beautiful

**Washu's reaction to the pink hair:** Silent for ten minutes. Then: "Your benefactor left fingerprints. Fascinating."

## 3.3 — Additional Children (Years 43-60)

Several more children follow — exact number to be determined, but the household expands:

| Order | Name | Year | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| 1 | Achika | 39 | Daughter; dark hair |
| 2 | Mamoru | 41 | Son; pink hair |
| 3 | TBD | ~45 | TBD |
| 4 | TBD | ~50 | TBD |
| 5+ | TBD | ~55-60 | May have more |

Children are spaced to allow individual attention and because Juraian childhoods are measured in decades, not years.

## 3.4 — Parenting Philosophy

**Sheldon's approach:**
- Present, engaged, patient
- Teaches through doing (cooking, building, explaining)
- Corrects his own father's absence by being there
- Never raises voice; always explains

**Yosho's approach:**
- Traditional in some ways (discipline, respect)
- Vastly experienced (700 years of watching children grow)
- Teaches through story and example
- More physical — sword practice, outdoor skills

**Together:**
- Unified front on major decisions
- Different strengths complement
- Children learn to go to the right parent for different needs

## 3.5 — The Children's Relationships

**With Tenchi:**
The children consider Tenchi their older brother — not step-uncle, not complicated. He was there when they were born. He changed diapers. Brother.

**With the Aunts:**
Each aunt develops specific relationships:
- Ryoko: Adventure aunt (takes them flying)
- Ayeka: Culture aunt (teaches etiquette, Juraian history)
- Sasami: Playmate aunt (closest in apparent age for years)
- Washu: Science aunt (lab experiments, controlled explosions)
- Mihoshi: Fun aunt (disaster-prone but loving)

**With each other:**
Sibling dynamics develop naturally. Achika as responsible eldest. Mamoru as gentle peacemaker. Others as they develop.

# PART 4: NOBUYUKI'S PASSING (Year ~55-65)

## 4.1 — The Approach

Nobuyuki ages normally despite proximity to Washu's technology. He chooses this — refuses life extension.

> "I've had a good life. I got to see my son grow into an extraordinary man. I got to see my father happy for the first time in... ever. I got to meet my grandchildren."
>
> *Smile.*
>
> "That's enough. More than enough."

## 4.2 — His Final Years

**Physical:**
- Gradual decline (normal aging)
- Moves to the shrine compound full-time around Year 50
- Sheldon becomes primary caretaker
- Washu offers — Nobuyuki declines — Sheldon honors his wishes

**Emotional:**
- At peace
- Reconciled with everything
- Proud of his son
- Grateful for the extended family he never expected

## 4.3 — The Death

**Timing:** Approximately Year 55-65 (2044-2054)
**Cause:** Natural causes (old age, peaceful)
**Location:** The shrine, surrounded by family

**Present:**
- Tenchi (holding his hand)
- Yosho (the father he never expected to outlive)
- Sheldon (the son-in-law who became a son)
- Grandchildren (those old enough to understand)

**Final words:** Something simple. Maybe just "Thank you."

## 4.4 — The Aftermath

**Funeral:**
- Traditional Shinto ceremony at the shrine
- Buried in the village cemetery
- The village turns out — he was one of theirs

**Grief:**
- Tenchi grieves normally (expected loss, still painful)
- Yosho grieves deeply (outliving another descendant)
- Sheldon grieves the father he chose

**Legacy:**
- His architectural designs preserved
- His name honored
- The house he designed becomes children's favorite memory location

# PART 5: EARTH'S TRANSFORMATION (Years 50-100)

## 5.1 — Gradual Disclosure

Earth's introduction to galactic civilization happens slowly:

| Decade | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Years 30-40 | Classified awareness (governments know) |
| Years 40-50 | Scientific community acknowledgment |
| Years 50-60 | Public disclosure (carefully managed) |
| Years 60-70 | First open galactic contact |
| Years 70-80 | Integration into galactic community begins |
| Years 80-100 | Earth is "known" but still provincial |

## 5.2 — The Masaki Role

The Masaki household serves as:
- Unofficial Earth-Jurai liaison
- Example of successful integration
- Protected diplomatic ground
- Training site for human-galactic relations

## 5.3 — Sheldon's Public Role

By Year 100, Sheldon has become:
- Recognized scientist (his work can finally be published openly)
- Cultural bridge figure
- "The human who married a Juraian prince"
- Quiet celebrity (he hates this)

He handles it by:
- Refusing most publicity
- Focusing on family
- Letting others be the face of integration
- Continuing to cook, build, and live simply

# PART 6: THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY (Year 80)

## 6.1 — The Milestone

**Date:** Year 80 (2069)
**Occasion:** 50 years since Sheldon arrived in 1989
**Also:** Their 50th wedding anniversary (if married Year 30)

## 6.2 — The Celebration

**Who attends:**
- All household members
- Extended Juraian family (including some who opposed the marriage)
- Uncle Kiyoshi's descendants (he's passed, but his grandchildren know the family)
- Village representatives (multiple generations now)
- Galactic dignitaries (low-key)

**The gift:**
Tenchi organizes a "memory book" — messages from everyone whose life Sheldon touched.

Pages and pages of:
- "You made me breakfast when I was scared."
- "You fixed my first experiment when it exploded."
- "You never treated me like an outsider."
- "You taught me to cook."
- "You were there."

Sheldon cries. Yosho holds him. Everyone pretends not to notice.

## 6.3 — The Private Moment

That night, alone:

> Yosho: "Fifty years."
> Sheldon: "Feels like ten."
> Yosho: "Feels like always."
>
> *Silence. Comfortable.*
>
> Sheldon: "Do you ever regret...?"
> Yosho: "Never. Not for a moment."
>
> *A kiss. Fifty years in.*
>
> Yosho: "We have centuries left."
> Sheldon: "I know."
> Yosho: "Good."

## 7.1 — The Household at Year 100

**Original members:**
- Sheldon (unchanged)
- Yosho (unchanged)

- Others (40s-50s, appear teens-20s)

**Grandchildren:**

## 7.2 — What Daily Life Looks Like

Remarkably similar to Year 30. The core rituals persist:
- Morning meditation
- Meals together
- Shrine duties
- Projects and adventures

The setting has changed (Earth is galactically connected now) but the values haven't.

## 7.3 — Looking Forward

At Year 100, Sheldon and Yosho face:
- 900 more years together (at least)
- Watching children have children have children
- Earth's continued evolution
- Their own slow journey toward whatever ending awaits

But for now: they are home. They are together. They are happy.
