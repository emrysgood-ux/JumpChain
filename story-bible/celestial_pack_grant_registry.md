# SECTION 12: GRANT PHILOSOPHY SUMMARY

**What Cosmos GRANTS:**
- Domestic skills (cooking, preservation)
- Teaching abilities (helping Tenchi)
- Comfort powers (Lambda infusion in food)
- Scientific enhancement (his existing expertise)
- Crafting abilities (building, repair)

**What Cosmos DOES NOT GRANT:**
- Combat powers (not his domain)
- Destructive abilities (against his nature)
- Mind control (violates autonomy)
- Powers that would overshadow canon characters

**Hidden Truth:** All food Sheldon cooks carries trace Lambda energy. Those who eat feel warmer, safer, more loved. He NEVER consciously learns this. Washu eventually detects it but keeps quiet.
