# SECTION 1: CANON BASELINE

## What Happens in Canon OVA

**Episode 1: "Ryoko Resurrected"**

1. **Setup:** Summer vacation. Tenchi (age 17) is curious about forbidden cave
2. **Trigger:** Yosho has been stoking Tenchi's curiosity for years
3. **Entry:** Tenchi steals keys, enters cave
4. **Discovery:** Finds mummified corpse (Ryoko), sword (Tenchi-ken)
5. **Accident:** Removes sword from Ryoko, breaking seal
6. **Awakening:** Ryoko's eyes open
7. **Attack:** Next day, Ryoko pursues Tenchi to school
8. **Destruction:** School destroyed in "playful" attack
9. **Defense:** Tenchi accidentally activates Tenchi-ken
10. **Wound:** Tenchi slashes Ryoko, damaging gem on wrist
11. **Retreat:** Ryoko withdraws (gem damage weakens her)
12. **Aftermath:** Ryoko later approaches Tenchi more calmly

**Key Canon Details:**
- Ryoko's attack was NOT serious — letting off 700 years of frustration
- Ryoko was watching Tenchi for years via astral projection
- Yosho planned everything — using Tenchi to eventually address Ryoko situation
- Tenchi-ken activating for Tenchi confirms his Juraian bloodline

# SECTION 2: WHAT CHANGES (DECISIONS)

## Change Assessment Framework

| Element | Canon | Our Story | Reason |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Tenchi's curiosity** | Stoked by Yosho + mother | Stoked by Yosho + Sheldon stories | Same dynamic, different participants |
| **Tenchi's preparation** | Untrained for real conflict | 12 years of emotional stability | Different response capacity |
| **Ryoko's observation target** | Tenchi only | Tenchi + Sheldon (limited) | Additional family member observed |
| **Yosho's position** | Single guardian | Partnered with Sheldon | More support available |
| **School destruction** | Happens | HAPPENS (no change) | Canon event preserved |
| **Ryoko's motivation** | 700 years frustration | Same (no change) | Her imprisonment unchanged |

---

## LOCKED DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Sheldon Does NOT Witness the Cave Entry

**Rationale:**
- Canon: Tenchi goes to cave during summer when home alone
- Our story: Sheldon is at work (he has established employment by Year 13)
- Preserves Tenchi's agency in triggering event
- Yosho PLANNED for Tenchi to do this alone

**LOCKED:** Sheldon is away when Tenchi enters cave.

---

### Decision 2: Sheldon IS Present for School Attack Aftermath

**Rationale:**
- News of school destruction would spread
- Sheldon would respond to family emergency
- Creates opportunity for Sheldon to witness Ryoko for first time
- Allows Sheldon's reaction to inform later scenes

**LOCKED:** Sheldon arrives at shrine during/after school attack response.

---

### Decision 3: Ryoko Recognizes Sheldon

**Rationale:**
- 12 years of astral observation (limited to cave entrance)
- She's seen him at shrine grounds many times
- First PHYSICAL meeting is significant
- Her reaction should acknowledge this

**How She Recognizes Him:**
- Sees Sheldon arrive at shrine
- Pauses mid-action (if still aggressive)
- Says something like: "You. I've seen you. With the boy."
- Creates beat of recognition before returning to primary focus (Tenchi)

**LOCKED:** Ryoko acknowledges Sheldon as "known" from observation.

---

### Decision 4: Ryoko's Attack Intensity Unchanged

**Rationale:**
- Her frustration is from 700 years imprisonment — not changed by 12 years observing Sheldon
- The attack on school was "mere child's play" (FAQ)
- She was never trying to seriously hurt Tenchi
- The EXTERNAL event remains identical

**LOCKED:** School destruction happens exactly as canon.

---

### Decision 5: Tenchi's RESPONSE Differs

**Rationale:**
- 12 years of stable two-father household
- Better emotional regulation
- Trained in kendo by Yosho (same as canon) but with better emotional foundation
- Doesn't panic as much; processes faster

**How Response Differs:**
| Canon Tenchi | Our Tenchi |
|--------------|------------|
| Terrified, runs | Scared but controlled |
| Defends reflexively | Defends deliberately |
| Distances from Ryoko afterward | Processes with family support |
| Slow to integrate Ryoko | Faster household adaptation |

**LOCKED:** Tenchi responds with more emotional stability but same physical actions.

---

### Decision 6: Yosho Reveals Warrior Status Same Timeline

**Rationale:**
- Canon: Yosho eventually intervenes, reveals he's the original "warrior"
- Our story: Same revelation timing
- Sheldon already knows Yosho's nature (from Year 4-5)
- Tenchi's revelation about grandfather happens same time

**LOCKED:** Yosho's warrior revelation follows canon timing.

---

# SECTION 4: RYOKO'S EARLY INTEGRATION

## Canon Path vs. Our Path

### Canon Integration:
1. Ryoko pursues Tenchi romantically from Day 1
2. Creates tension, property damage
3. Ayeka arrival escalates rivalry
4. Slow establishment of "harem dynamic"
5. Eventually accepts household role

### Our Integration:
1. Ryoko pursues Tenchi — meets FAMILY instead
2. Sheldon's presence provides different model
3. Ayeka arrival still creates conflict but absorbs differently
4. "Aunt dynamic" established through family meals, shared spaces
5. Rivalry de-escalated (not eliminated) through structure

---

## Key Integration Scenes (Post-Release)

### Scene: First Meal with Ryoko
**POV:** Sheldon
**Purpose:** Establish cooking as integration mechanism

- Sheldon cooking as usual
- Ryoko appears (phasing through walls)
- Awkward first meal together
- Ryoko tastes "real food" for first time in 700 years
- Emotional beat: vulnerability beneath aggression

---

### Scene: Ryoko and Tenchi (with Sheldon present)
**POV:** Tenchi
**Purpose:** Show changed dynamic

- Ryoko attempts seduction (canon behavior)
- Tenchi responds with calm boundary (our Tenchi)
- Sheldon intervenes naturally (not dramatically)
- Ryoko confused by lack of expected response
- Sets up "aunt dynamic" possibility

---

### Scene: Ryoko Asks About Sheldon
**POV:** Ryoko
**Purpose:** Address her 12 years of observation

- Ryoko approaches Sheldon directly
- "You're different. I watched you for years. What are you?"
- Sheldon's response: honest but limited (he doesn't know himself fully)
- Plants seed for later Washu investigation
- Shows Ryoko's intelligence beneath chaos

---

# SECTION 5: PROBABILITY CASCADE INITIATED

## First-Order Effects (From Ryoko's Release)

| Event | Canon Result | Our Result | Cascade |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------|
| Tenchi processes trauma | Slow, isolated | Fast, family support | Better state for Ayeka arrival |
| Ryoko settles in | Chaotic | Still chaotic but channeled | Meals as structure |
| Yosho's secret | Partially revealed | Same timing | Sheldon's knowledge confirmed |
| Household dynamic | Two males + Ryoko | Three adults + Ryoko | More stability |

## Second-Order Effects (Leading to Ayeka)

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Tenchi's state when Ayeka arrives | More composed |
| Ryoko's position when Ayeka arrives | Partially integrated |
| Household's capacity to absorb crisis | Higher |
| Sheldon's role during space battle | Present, observing |
