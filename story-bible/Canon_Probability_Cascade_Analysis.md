# PURPOSE

Before we can write Years 13-25 (Canon Era), we must:
1. Establish the exact OVA event sequence
2. Identify what we've already decided changes
3. Calculate how each change propagates
4. Identify gaps requiring research/decisions

# PART 5: PROBABILITY CASCADE FRAMEWORK

## 5.1 — First-Order Changes (Direct)

These flow directly from Sheldon's presence:

| Ayeka's arrival | Meets established family, not chaos |
| Kagato arc | Additional capable adult present |
| Washu's investigation | New puzzle to solve |

## 5.2 — Second-Order Changes (Cascade)

These flow from first-order changes:

|-------------|--------------|
| Ryoko meets family | Integrates faster, less destructive |
| Ayeka meets family | Rivalry de-escalated |
| Household stable | All crises handled better |
| Washu has puzzle | Investigates throughout |

## 5.3 — Third-Order Changes (Probability)

These depend on character choices:

| Situation | Probability Range |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Romantic dynamics | May resolve faster / differently |
| Political implications | Jurai responds to changes |
| Cosmic attention | Chousin may notice Sheldon |

# PART 6: RECOMMENDED APPROACH

## 6.1 — Research Phase

1. **Verify OVA episode details** — Exact events, timing, dialogue
2. **Confirm canon character behaviors** — How does Ryoko actually act?
3. **Map Washu's investigation capabilities** — What can she detect?
4. **Understand Chousin nature** — Would they notice Cosmos's work?

## 6.2 — Decision Phase

1. **Lock Ryoko release scene** — What exactly happens?
2. **Decide Sheldon's role in Kagato arc** — Observer or participant?
3. **Plan Washu investigation** — Timeline and conclusions
4. **Place original arcs** — When does Shadow Arc occur?

## 6.3 — Writing Phase

1. **Year 13: Awakening** — Ryoko through Washu
2. **Year 14: Kagato/Washu** — Major threats and new family
3. **Years 15-17: Dr. Clay through Z** — Escalating cosmic stakes
