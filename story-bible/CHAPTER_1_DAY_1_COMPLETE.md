## SCENE 1.1: THE AWAKENING

**April 3, 1989 — 14:47:23 JST**
**Location:** Field below Masaki Shrine
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The first thing was light.

Not the harsh fluorescent glare of the laboratory or the cold blue of monitoring screens. This was warm. Diffuse. The kind of light that came through leaves, through sky, through the membrane between sleeping and waking.

I wasn't sleeping.

The second thing was grass. I could feel it against my palms—individual blades pressing into skin, soft and slightly damp. The sensation was so specific, so immediate, that for a moment it was the only thing that existed. Just grass and light and the slow realization that I was lying on my back, staring up at a sky so blue it seemed artificial.

I tried to remember how I'd gotten here.

Alaska. The facility. Final calibrations on the detector array, Maria's voice over the intercom asking if I wanted coffee, the way the readouts had spiked just before—

The light.

Not this light. That light had been different. White-hot and absolute, the kind of brightness that didn't give your eyes time to adjust because it was already too late. I'd looked up at exactly the wrong moment. I'd seen the cascade failure begin, watched the containment fields collapse in sequence like dominoes made of lightning, and I'd had just enough time to think *oh* before—

Before what?

I was lying in a field. The sky was blue. Birds were singing somewhere nearby, a three-note pattern that repeated with mechanical precision. I could feel my heart beating in my chest, which seemed significant for reasons I couldn't quite articulate.

The dead don't have heartbeats. That was the general consensus.

I sat up.

The motion was easier than it should have been. My body moved without the usual negotiations—no stiff joints protesting, no lower back sending urgent memos about proper lifting technique. I just... sat up. Like sitting up was something bodies did naturally, without complaint.

The field stretched around me in every direction. Grass, mostly. Wild and uncut, swaying slightly in a breeze I could barely feel. Mountains in the distance, blue-gray shapes against the horizon. Trees closer, a dark line of forest maybe two hundred meters away. The sun was behind me, warm on the back of my neck, casting my shadow long across the grass.

I looked down at my hands.

They were my hands. The same hands that had spent years at keyboards and lab equipment, that had written dissertations and calibrated instruments and made coffee at three in the morning when the data refused to cooperate. But they looked... different. Younger, maybe. The calluses were gone. The small scar on my left index finger from the time I'd sliced it open on a broken beaker in grad school—that was gone too.

I pushed up my sleeves and checked my forearms. The burn mark from the soldering accident in Kyoto. Gone. The weird patch of rough skin I'd had since childhood that no dermatologist could explain. Gone.

My body was the same shape—short, stocky, familiar—but it had been... cleaned. Reset. Like someone had taken the original blueprints and manufactured a fresh copy, minus all the accumulated damage.

I got to my feet.

Again, too easy. My knees didn't crack. My ankles didn't protest. I just stood, and then I was standing, and the world didn't spin or tilt or do any of the things it usually did when I moved too quickly.

The field was real. I was standing in it. These seemed like facts worth acknowledging.

I patted my pockets and found a wallet. Leather, worn at the edges, surprisingly familiar in my hand. Inside: a driver's license with my photo, issued to someone named Tsukino Sheldon. Japanese characters I could read without thinking about it, an address in a prefecture I'd never heard of, a birthdate that was mine.

Tsukino. The name sat strangely in my mind, familiar and foreign at the same time. Like hearing someone mispronounce a word you'd only ever seen written down.

There was cash in the wallet too. Japanese yen. And bank books—multiple bank books—with account numbers and balances that seemed impossible for someone who'd spent most of his career on postdoc stipends.

I put the wallet back in my pocket.

The laboratory had been in Alaska. The field was clearly not in Alaska. The documents said I was Japanese, which I wasn't—or hadn't been—or—

I took a breath. The air was clean. Startlingly clean, compared to what I remembered. No chemical undertaste from the facility's ventilation system, no hint of ozone or processed air. Just... air. The kind of air that came from being surrounded by growing things and open sky.

The cascade failure had been fatal. I'd known that. I'd seen the numbers on the readouts, seen the look on Maria's face through the glass, and I'd known. There hadn't been time to be afraid. There'd barely been time to be surprised.

And now I was standing in a field in Japan with a body that felt like it had never been used and documents that said I belonged here.

I started walking toward the treeline.

It wasn't a conscious decision, exactly. More like a recognition that standing in the middle of a field wasn't going to answer any questions, and the trees at least offered direction. Purpose. Something to move toward.

My legs carried me without complaint. Each step felt solid, certain, like my feet remembered how to walk even if the rest of me wasn't sure what was happening. The grass brushed against my pants—dark slacks, the kind I would have worn to work—and the sun moved slowly across the sky as I walked.

The treeline grew closer. Cedar, mostly, tall and dark and smelling of something clean and ancient. A path emerged between the trunks, dirt packed smooth by what looked like years of foot traffic. The path headed uphill, curving away into the shadows under the canopy.

I stopped at the edge of the forest and looked back.

The field was empty. No indication of how I'd gotten there, no convenient explanation written in the grass. Just a landscape that looked like it had existed for centuries before I'd appeared in it, and would continue existing long after I left.

The birds were still singing. That same three-note pattern, over and over.

I turned and entered the trees.

The air was cooler under the canopy, the light filtered through layers of green and brown. The path was clear, well-maintained, leading upward at a gentle grade. My feet found their rhythm on the packed earth, and I let them carry me forward.

Somewhere ahead, I could see the path opening up again. A glimpse of sky, a suggestion of cleared ground, and something else—stone, maybe, arranged in a pattern too regular to be natural.

Steps.

A long flight of stone steps, leading up the mountain.

I stopped at the base and looked up. The steps climbed through the forest, disappearing around a curve maybe fifty meters above me. Old stone, worn smooth at the edges by generations of feet. A torii gate stood at the bottom, red paint faded to something closer to rust, marking the transition from forest path to something else.

A shrine. This was the approach to a shrine.

I didn't know how I knew that. But I knew it the same way I knew my own name—knew both my names, Carter and Tsukino, existing simultaneously in my head like two versions of the same document.

The stone steps waited.

I put my foot on the first one and began to climb.

## SCENE 1.2: THE ASCENT

**April 3, 1989 — 15:30 JST**
**Location:** Masaki Shrine steps
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The steps counted themselves as I climbed.

Not consciously—I wasn't running a tally in my head, watching numbers increment like a fitness tracker. But some part of my mind noted each stone as I passed it, cataloging the way they varied in height and depth, the patterns of wear that told stories about centuries of feet choosing the same paths.

Twenty steps in, and the torii gate was behind me. The forest closed in on both sides, cedar branches reaching across the gap like they were trying to hold hands overhead. The light came through in patches, dappling the stone with gold and green.

Forty steps. The path curved slightly, following the contour of the mountain. I could hear water somewhere below—a stream, maybe, running through a gully I couldn't see. The sound was constant, a bass note under the birdsong that still continued its three-note pattern.

I kept climbing.

My body continued to behave strangely. By sixty steps, I should have been feeling something—the familiar burn in my thighs, the tightness in my chest that came from asking lungs to process more oxygen than usual. Instead there was only the rhythm of movement, step following step with mechanical precision.

At eighty steps, I stopped to test it.

I stood on the worn stone and waited for my breathing to catch up with my exertion. It didn't need to. My breath came as easily as if I'd been standing still. My heart rate was elevated—I could feel that, the slightly faster pulse in my wrists—but not by much. Not by as much as it should have been.

I started climbing again.

The forest thinned slightly around the hundredth step, allowing glimpses of sky through the canopy. Stone lanterns appeared on either side of the path, their surfaces mottled with lichen that suggested decades of weathering. One of them had a crack running down its side, carefully repaired with some kind of adhesive that had discolored over time.

Someone took care of this place. Someone had been taking care of it for a very long time.

The steps continued. 

At a hundred and fifty, the incline steepened briefly, and I found a rhythm that accommodated the change—shorter steps, slightly more forward lean, weight distributed carefully across each foot. My body knew how to do this. Had always known, maybe, or had learned so thoroughly that the knowledge lived in muscle rather than memory.

By two hundred steps, I'd stopped expecting the fatigue to hit. It wasn't coming. Whatever had happened to me—whatever had put me in that field with a new name and reset body—had also given me endurance that didn't match anything I remembered possessing. 

I thought about marathons. I'd never run one, never wanted to. But I'd known people who did, watched them train, listened to them talk about the wall that hit at mile twenty when glycogen stores depleted and willpower became the only fuel left. This climb wasn't a marathon, but it was work—real, physical work—and my body was doing it without complaint.

Not supernatural. I wasn't flying or moving at impossible speeds or doing anything that violated the laws of physics I'd spent my career studying. Just... capable. More capable than I had any right to be.

The two hundred and fiftieth step brought the first clear view of the shrine grounds.

Through a gap in the trees, I could see buildings—traditional construction, wood and tile, the kind of architecture that looked like it had grown from the mountain rather than being built on it. A main hall, smaller structures clustered around it, paths of raked gravel connecting everything in patterns that suggested both functionality and ritual.

And the tree.

The tree stood at the center of everything, and it was... wrong.

Not wrong like damaged or dying. Wrong like a word you've been using your whole life suddenly sounds foreign. The tree was ancient—that much was obvious from the girth of its trunk, the way its canopy spread across the shrine grounds like a green umbrella. But there was something else about it, something that made my eyes want to slide away and focus on anything else.

I forced myself to look.

The bark was gray-brown, deeply furrowed, the kind of texture that accumulated over centuries. The branches reached outward and upward in patterns that should have been random but somehow weren't. And there was a presence to it, a sense of... weight? Attention? Like the tree was watching back.

I shook my head and kept climbing.

Two hundred and eighty. Two hundred and ninety. The last stretch was steeper than the rest, the steps narrower, forcing me to pay attention to my footing. I could see the final landing above me now—flat stone, swept clean, marking the transition from approach to arrival.

Three hundred.

Ten more steps. The shrine grounds opened before me, framed by the last of the forest. I could see details now—the way the gravel paths were edged with carefully placed stones, the small structures that served purposes I couldn't guess at, the quiet emptiness that suggested either abandonment or the special stillness of sacred spaces between ceremonies.

Three hundred and ten.

The tree dominated everything. Even when I wasn't looking directly at it, I was aware of its presence—the way it anchored the space, the way everything else seemed to orient around it. The feeling of being watched had intensified as I climbed, and I realized it wasn't my imagination. Something about this place was paying attention.

Three hundred and fifteen.

Three hundred and sixteen. Three hundred and seventeen.

Three hundred and eighteen.

Three hundred and nineteen.

Three hundred and twenty.

I stepped onto the landing and stood at the top of the shrine approach.

The late afternoon light came in at a slant, gilding the tile roofs with gold. Shadows stretched long across the gravel paths. The tree's branches moved slightly in a breeze I couldn't feel, leaves rustling with a sound like whispered conversation.

I had climbed three hundred and twenty steps without breaking stride. My legs felt fine. My lungs felt fine. My heart was beating normally, unhurried, unconcerned.

The tree watched me. I didn't know how I knew that, but I knew it the way I knew the sun was behind me—as a fact too obvious to question.

I was standing at Masaki Shrine, and something here was aware that I'd arrived.

**Location:** Masaki Shrine grounds
**POV:** Multi (Chronological Interleaving)

### POV: SHELDON — 16:15

The old man emerged from between the buildings like he'd been waiting for exactly this moment.

I watched him approach—white hair, deeply lined face, the traditional robes of a Shinto priest rendered in dark blue and white. His movements were careful, deliberate, the movements of someone whose body had learned to negotiate with age rather than fight it. But his eyes were sharp. Sharper than they had any right to be.

"Good afternoon," the old man said, his Japanese crisp and welcoming. "You've climbed quite a distance. Welcome to Masaki Shrine."

I found myself answering in the formal register I'd learned in Kyoto, the words emerging without conscious thought. "Thank you, Gūji-sama. I apologize for arriving unannounced."

The priest's eyebrows rose slightly. "Your Japanese is excellent. Kyoto-trained, unless I miss my guess?"

"Yes, Gūji-sama."

"Formal, though. Very formal." His eyes crinkled with what might have been amusement. "We are somewhat less ceremonious here in the countryside. 'Masaki-san' will do."

"Masaki-san," I repeated. "I am... my name is Tsukino. Sheldon Tsukino."

---

### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:15

The old priest had felt him coming for the last twenty minutes.

Not clearly—not the way he could sense Juraian technology or the specific signature of Funaho's imprisoned guest stirring in her sleep. This was subtler. A ripple in the patterns he'd spent seven centuries learning to read.

He'd emerged from the shrine office when the presence reached the top, and found himself facing someone he'd never seen before.

Dark skin, short hair, clothes that looked vaguely professional but not quite Japanese. And around him—through him—something Katsuhito couldn't name. A resonance that made Funaho's branches shiver, though there was no wind.

The tree felt it too, then. Interesting.

The stranger's response came in formal Japanese—Kyoto-formal, the kind that hadn't been commonly spoken since before the war. Where had an American learned to speak like that?

"Tsukino-san," he said, keeping his voice warm. "What brings you to our mountain?"

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:17

"I don't entirely know," I admitted. "I woke in a field below. I cannot explain how I arrived there. I saw this path and I... followed it."

The priest's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his posture.

"You woke in a field." Not a question. Just a repetition, giving me space to elaborate.

"I have identification," I said, reaching carefully into my pocket. "Documents. I'm not here to cause trouble. I simply don't know where else to go."

I produced the wallet. The priest didn't reach for it, just looked at the driver's license, then back at my face.

"And your documents say you have claim to property here?"

"There's a house. The Tsukino house. According to these, it belongs to me."

The priest was quiet for a long moment. The tree at the center of the grounds moved slightly in a breeze I couldn't feel.

"There is a Tsukino property," he said finally. "On the north side of the compound. It's been empty for some years."

---

### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:20

Seven centuries of watching humans had given him a sense for damaged souls. This one was damaged. But not, he thought, dangerous.

The tree agreed. Funaho's attention had focused on this newcomer with something that felt almost like recognition.

"I remember dying," the stranger said quietly.

The words hung in the afternoon air. Katsuhito had heard many confessions in seven centuries. He had never heard anyone say those words with such certainty.

"That must have been frightening," he said carefully.

"I don't know what it was. I don't know what any of this is."

"And yet you climbed three hundred twenty steps to find out."

"I didn't know there would be steps. I just... walked."

He made a decision. It wasn't based on logic—logic counseled sending this stranger away. It was based on something older.

"The Tsukino house needs work," he said. "Tonight, you can sleep in our guest room. Tomorrow, we'll assess what needs to be done."

The stranger stared at him. "You're saying I can stay?"

"You look like a man who could use a meal."

---

### POV: TENCHI — 16:25

Ojii-chan was talking to someone.

Tenchi stopped at the top of the steps, his school bag heavy on his shoulders. He'd run most of the way from the bus stop, like he always did—up all three hundred and twenty steps. He liked counting.

But now he stopped. Because Ojii-chan was standing near the big tree, talking to a man Tenchi had never seen before.

The man was tall. His skin was dark, darker than anyone Tenchi knew. He was looking at Ojii-chan with an expression Tenchi didn't have words for.

Sad, maybe. Or confused.

"Ah," Ojii-chan said, spotting him. "Tenchi. Come here."

Tenchi walked forward slowly. The stranger turned, and his eyes—they were kind eyes. Tired, but kind.

"This is Tsukino-san," Ojii-chan said. "He's going to be staying at the old house."

"Hello," Tenchi said.

"Hello," the stranger said back. His voice was deep but gentle. "You must be Tenchi."

Tenchi nodded. "I'm four."

"That's a good age."

"Are you going to live here?"

The stranger glanced at Ojii-chan. "I think so. For a while."

"The old house is dusty," Tenchi informed him. This was important. He'd explored it once.

"I'll clean it."

"I can help." The words came before Tenchi thought about them. But the stranger looked like he needed help.

Something shifted in the man's face—not quite a smile, but softer.

"I'd like that," he said.

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:30

The child held out his hand with complete unselfconsciousness.

"I'll show you where we wash our hands," Tenchi said. "Ojii-chan says it's important."

I took his hand. His fingers were warm and small, wrapping around mine with surprising strength.

"Tenchi will give you the tour," Masaki-san said. "I'll prepare the guest room. Dinner will be ready in a few hours."

Tenchi led me to a stone basin near the main building. Water trickled into it from a bamboo pipe.

"You put water on your hands," he explained, demonstrating. "And then you wash them."

I followed his instructions. The cold water was grounding—real water, real stone, a real child teaching me shrine etiquette.

"Are you sad?" Tenchi asked.

The question was so direct I couldn't deflect it.

"I don't know," I said honestly. "I think I might be."

Tenchi considered this. "My mom died," he said. "So I know about being sad."

The words were matter-of-fact, the way children sometimes spoke about enormous things.

"I'm sorry," I said.

"It's okay. Ojii-chan says she's still watching me, even if I can't see her."

I looked down at this four-year-old who spoke about death with casual acceptance.

"I think he might be right," I said.

Tenchi nodded, satisfied. "Come on. I'll show you the old house."

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:45

The Tsukino house emerged from the trees like something from another century.

Traditional construction, single story, with a roof that sagged slightly at one corner. Shutters closed, engawa dusty, garden overgrown. But the foundation looked solid.

"It's been empty a long time," Tenchi informed me. "Since before I was born."

I stood at the edge of the property, looking at a house that was supposedly mine.

Masaki-san appeared on the path behind us. "The house will need work. But the bones are good. Your family built it well."

*My family.* I didn't have a family—not anymore. But the documents said otherwise.

"Tomorrow we can open it properly," Masaki-san continued. "For tonight, the guest room will be more comfortable."

Tenchi was still holding my hand. He hadn't let go since the washing basin.

"Dinner?" he asked his grandfather.

"Soon. Why don't you show Tsukino-san where we keep the vegetables? He can help you carry them in."

Tenchi's eyes lit up. "This way."

I let him lead me toward a vegetable garden and a dinner I hadn't expected, in a place I'd never meant to find.

Behind me, I could feel the tree watching.

## SCENE 1.4: SETTLING IN

**April 3, 1989 — 17:00 JST**
**Location:** Masaki Shrine — Main house guest room
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The guest room was small, traditional, and immaculately clean.

Masaki-san had led me here after Tenchi reluctantly released my hand to start his homework. The room was maybe six tatami mats, but it felt larger somehow. Sparse furnishings, careful proportions, the stillness of a space designed for rest.

A futon was already laid out, the bedding fresh. A small table sat in one corner with a lamp, a tea set, and a folded yukata.

"The bathroom is down the hall," Masaki-san said. "I'll call you when dinner is ready. Please, rest."

Then he was gone, sliding the door closed behind him with quiet precision.

I stood in the center of the room and waited for the stillness to become uncomfortable.

It didn't.

The silence here was different from the hermetically sealed quiet of laboratories. This was alive. I could hear birds outside, distant water, old wood settling into evening. The silence was full.

I sat on the futon and looked at my hands.

They still looked wrong. Clean in a way that erased decades of accumulated damage. Calluses gone, scars gone, even the roughness from years of handling equipment.

I was in a body that felt like mine but wasn't quite.

After a few minutes, I got up to explore.

---

The engawa wrapped around the building's exterior, offering views of the shrine grounds. The sun was lower now, casting long shadows. The main hall was visible—larger than I'd realized, with proportions suggesting age and significance.

And the tree.

Always the tree.

It dominated the view from anywhere in the compound. In the fading light, it looked almost... luminous. Not glowing exactly, but present in a way that ordinary trees weren't.

I found myself walking toward it.

The gravel crunched under my feet. The air was cooling, carrying the scent of cedar and something else—something clean and old.

The trunk was massive up close. Too massive for its apparent species. My mind tried to calculate its age—six hundred years? Eight hundred? The bark was deeply furrowed, suggesting centuries of weather and waiting.

I reached out and touched it.

The bark was warm. Not sun-warm—the trunk was in shadow—but warm in some other way. Like touching something alive and paying attention.

I pulled my hand back.

The branches moved. There was no wind.

I stood there for a long moment, looking up at a tree that was somehow watching me.

"She likes you."

I turned. Masaki-san stood at the edge of the courtyard.

"She?"

"The tree. She's been here a very long time. She doesn't notice most people."

"Trees don't notice people."

"No?" Something almost like amusement in his voice. "Perhaps not ordinary trees."

He walked closer, and both of us looked up at the branches that were definitely not moving, that had definitely been moving moments before.

"You've been through something," he said.

"Yes."

"You don't know what."

"No."

"But you're here now. And whatever brought you to this place... it brought you to the right place."

"How do you know?"

"Because she likes you. And she has very good judgment."

---

The tour continued.

The main hall, where ceremonies were performed. The office for administrative work. The smaller buildings—storage, ritual preparation, a shed for lawn equipment that seemed comically mundane next to everything else.

The Tsukino house was visible through trees to the north.

"Tomorrow," Masaki-san said. "We'll open it properly."

"You said my family built it."

"Your documents say so. The registration goes back several generations." He paused. "You don't remember them?"

"No." The word felt inadequate.

"Memory is strange. It comes and goes. Sometimes the important things stay hidden until we're ready to see them."

"That sounds like something a priest would say."

"Three times a day, minimum. Come. Dinner will be ready soon."

---

The kitchen was smaller than the guest room but felt larger—the expansion that came from purpose and activity. Katsuhito had already started preparations, and the smell of rice cooking mingled with something that made my stomach remember it had been hours since I'd eaten.

Had I eaten anything? I couldn't remember.

"Knife skills?" Katsuhito asked, handing me a cutting board and vegetables.

"Adequate."

"Good." He set me to work on daikon while he prepared the fish. "Tenchi will be happy to have someone new at dinner. He doesn't get many visitors."

"He seems like a good kid."

"He is. His mother died last year. He's handled it better than most adults would."

I thought about the boy's matter-of-fact statement—*My mom died*—and the weight behind those simple words.

"He told me."

"He doesn't tell everyone." Katsuhito looked up, eyes sharp. "He trusted you quickly. He doesn't usually do that."

The knife moved through the daikon in steady strokes, rhythm covering my uncertainty.

"I don't know why any of this is happening," I said finally.

"Few of us do. But we make dinner anyway. And eventually, the reasons either reveal themselves or they don't."

"That's not very comforting."

"No. But it's honest. And I've found honesty is usually better than comfort."

Through the window, the tree's branches silhouetted against darkening sky.

Still watching.

## SCENE 1.5: FIRST MEAL (PREPARATION)

**April 3, 1989 — ~18:00 JST**
**Location:** Main residence kitchen
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The knock came at exactly six o'clock.

Sheldon opened the door to find Tenchi standing in the hallway, still in his school clothes but with a small apron tied over them. The apron was too big—it had been made for an adult—and the boy had folded it several times at the waist to keep it from dragging on the floor.

"Ojii-chan says dinner is starting," Tenchi announced. "I'm helping tonight. Do you want to help too?"

The question was asked with the guileless directness of childhood—an invitation, not a test. Sheldon felt something warm spread through his chest.

"I would like that very much, Tenchi-kun."

The boy beamed and grabbed his hand, pulling him down the covered walkway toward the main residence with a strength that surprised him. Tenchi's fingers were small and warm, gripping Sheldon's much larger hand with the confidence of someone who had never been given a reason to doubt that adults would follow where he led.

*Sheru-nii.*

The name echoed in Sheldon's mind. He hadn't been anyone's brother—not really, not by blood—and the sudden weight of the title settled on his shoulders with more significance than it probably deserved. A child's nickname. Nothing more.

But it felt like a promise he didn't remember making.

---

The kitchen was larger than Sheldon had expected.

Traditional in design but clearly functional—a gas stove sat beside a wood-burning kamado that looked like it had been in use for generations, and the counters held a collection of ceramic bowls, wooden implements, and steel knives that spoke of serious cooking. Katsuhito stood at the sink, washing rice with the practiced efficiency of long routine.

"Tsukino-san." The priest didn't turn around. "Can you handle a knife?"

"Yes, Masaki-san."

"Good. The daikon needs cutting. Tenchi, show him where the vegetables are."

Tenchi led Sheldon to a small cold storage area—not a refrigerator in the modern sense, but a naturally cool alcove built into the north wall of the kitchen. Inside, vegetables waited in neat rows: daikon radish, several types of greens, small mushrooms, a bundle of green onions.

"Ojii-chan grows some of these," Tenchi said proudly. "Behind the shrine. I help with the watering sometimes."

Sheldon selected a daikon—pale and firm, about the length of his forearm—and carried it back to the cutting board Katsuhito had indicated. A knife waited there, its edge glinting in the kitchen light. He picked it up, tested the weight, and began to cut.

*Thin slices. Even thickness. Let the blade do the work.*

Grandmother's voice again, from a kitchen in Georgia that felt like another lifetime. She'd taught him to cut vegetables before she'd taught him to read—"A boy who can feed himself won't ever go hungry"—and his hands remembered the lessons even when his mind was elsewhere.

The daikon yielded to the blade in clean, even circles. Not beautiful, not artistic, but competent. Serviceable. The kind of cutting that would disappear into the dish without drawing attention to itself.

Katsuhito glanced over. "You've done this before."

"My grandmother taught me. She believed in self-sufficiency."

"A wise woman." The priest finished rinsing the rice and set it to soak. "Self-sufficiency is the foundation of everything else. A man who can feed himself, shelter himself, care for himself—that man is free. That man can choose his obligations rather than being chosen by them."

Sheldon continued cutting. "Is that a Shinto teaching?"

"It is a life teaching." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "Shinto is life, Tsukino-san. Not separate from it."

---

They worked in comfortable rhythm.

Katsuhito managed the rice and the miso soup, moving between stove and counter with the unhurried efficiency of someone who had made this meal thousands of times. Tenchi's job, apparently, was to set out the dishes—small ceramic bowls and plates that he retrieved from a cabinet and arranged on a tray with careful concentration.

Sheldon's assignment expanded from daikon to include slicing mushrooms, mincing green onions, and trimming the greens that would accompany the fish. Each task came with a quiet word from Katsuhito—"thinner," "smaller pieces," "yes, like that"—and Sheldon found himself falling into the instruction with something like relief.

This he could do. This made sense. The knife in his hand, the vegetables on the board, the accumulating evidence of a meal taking shape—these were real. These were grounded. These required no explanation beyond the simple logic of hunger and feeding.

"Sheru-nii, can you reach that?"

Tenchi was pointing at a jar on a high shelf—pickled vegetables, from the look of it. Sheldon stretched up and retrieved it easily, setting it on the counter within the boy's reach.

"Thank you!" Tenchi opened the jar with both hands, struggling slightly with the lid until it gave. Inside, pale slices of something—turnip, maybe—waited in brine. "These are Ojii-chan's favorite. He makes them himself."

"Your grandfather pickles his own vegetables?"

"He does many things himself," Katsuhito said from the stove. There was amusement in his voice. "Self-sufficiency, Tsukino-san. As I said."

---

The fish came last.

It was ayu—sweetfish, Katsuhito explained, from the river that ran through the valley below. He'd caught them that morning, and they'd been resting in salt since noon. Now he threaded them onto skewers with a practiced twist of his wrist, transforming each small fish into a shape like a swimmer frozen mid-leap.

"The form matters," the priest said, showing Sheldon the technique. "A fish should look alive even when it is cooking. Like this—see? The curve of the spine, the angle of the head. We honor the fish by presenting it beautifully."

Sheldon watched, memorizing the movements. His hands wanted to try—he could feel them itching with the desire to replicate what they'd seen—but he held back. This was not his kitchen. This was not his technique. Not yet.

"The fire should be hot but not fierce," Katsuhito continued, setting the skewered fish over the charcoal. "We want crisp skin, not burnt. Patience, Tsukino-san. The fish will tell you when it is ready."

"How?"

"Listen." The priest smiled. "The sizzle changes when the fat begins to render. The smell changes when the proteins set. The fish speaks, if you know how to hear it."

Sheldon stood beside the grill and listened. At first, he heard only the hiss of moisture meeting heat—a sound like rain on hot pavement, fierce and immediate. But as the fish cooked, the sound shifted. Softened. Became something rounder, more consistent.

"Now," Katsuhito said, and turned the skewers.

The fish on the underside was golden-brown, the skin crisp and glistening. The smell that rose from it was salt and smoke and something else—something alive, despite the death that had preceded it.

"How did you know?"

"Practice." The priest's eyes crinkled. "A few thousand fish, give or take. Eventually, the knowing becomes part of you. You will learn, Tsukino-san. Everyone does who is willing to pay attention."

---

The meal came together in stages.

Rice, lifted from the pot and placed in individual bowls with the precise portions Katsuhito specified. Miso soup, ladled into lacquer bowls that Tenchi carried to the table with both hands, tongue between his teeth in concentration. The fish, removed from the skewers and arranged on a single plate to be shared. Pickles. Greens dressed with a light sauce. Tea, brewed and poured.

By the time they finished, the kitchen looked like a meal had happened there—not messy, but used, the evidence of work visible in the scattered vegetable scraps and the dampness of the cutting board.

"Tenchi, take the rice to the table," Katsuhito said. "I'll bring the fish. Tsukino-san—" He paused, looking at Sheldon with an expression that might have been assessment. "Will you carry the soup?"

"Yes, Masaki-san."

The bowls were warm in his hands—just warm enough to feel the life of the food through the lacquer. Sheldon followed Tenchi through the hallway to the dining area, where the low table waited with cushions arranged on three sides.

A place for him. Already set. Already expected.

*Home,* some part of him thought, and the word didn't hurt as much as he'd expected.

## SCENE 1.6: FIRST MEAL (EATING)

**April 3, 1989 — ~19:30 JST**
**Location:** Main residence dining area
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

"Itadakimasu."

The word came from all three of them simultaneously—Sheldon's voice deeper, Tenchi's high and eager, Katsuhito's quiet and measured. A blessing and a beginning, the formal acknowledgment that food was about to be received.

Sheldon lifted his rice bowl with his left hand, his chopsticks with his right, and took the first bite.

The rice was perfect. Not the word he would have used in his previous life—rice had been rice, a vehicle for other flavors, a filler for empty corners of plates. But this rice was different. Each grain distinct, slightly sweet, with a texture that yielded exactly right under his teeth. He could taste the water it had been cooked in. He could taste the mountain.

"The rice comes from Yamamoto-san's fields," Katsuhito said, watching him eat. "He grows it in the valley below. Good water makes good rice."

"It's excellent, Masaki-san."

"Call it what it is. Good rice is one of the few things in life that requires no qualification." The priest smiled and turned to his own bowl. "Tenchi, how was school today?"

The boy swallowed a mouthful of fish before answering—bad manners, Sheldon noted, but no correction came from Katsuhito. Perhaps the rules were different here. Perhaps the old priest understood that children needed room to be children.

"We drew pictures," Tenchi said. "Yamada-sensei said mine was very good. It was a picture of the shrine."

"And what did you draw at the shrine?"

"The big tree." Tenchi's voice shifted slightly—quieter, more careful. "And the mountain. And you, Ojii-chan. Standing by the tree."

Katsuhito's chopsticks paused for just a moment—so brief Sheldon almost missed it—before resuming their work. "That sounds like a fine picture. I should like to see it."

"I left it at school. But I can bring it tomorrow."

"Do that."

Sheldon ate in silence, letting the conversation flow around him. There was something in the exchange he didn't understand—an undercurrent, a weight—but it wasn't his place to ask. He was a guest here, newly arrived. Some things took time to reveal themselves.

---

The fish was extraordinary.

Sheldon had eaten fish before—tilapia and catfish in Georgia, salmon and cod in California, whatever the convenience store offered near his Alaska lab. But this was something else. The skin crackled between his teeth, giving way to flesh that was firm and clean and tasted like the river it had come from. No muddy undertones, no fishiness. Just the pure essence of a creature that had lived well and died quickly.

"You like the ayu," Katsuhito observed.

"I've never tasted anything like it."

"The river here is very clean. Too clean, perhaps—the water comes from the mountain, filtered through rock and forest, and brings little sediment with it. The fish grow slowly, but they grow well." The priest took a bite of his own portion. "Some things cannot be rushed, Tsukino-san. The fish knows this. Perhaps we should learn from the fish."

"Ojii-chan talks like that a lot," Tenchi confided, leaning toward Sheldon conspiratorially. "About fish and trees and things. I don't always understand what he means."

"Understanding comes when it comes," Katsuhito said mildly. "There is no rush for that, either."

Tenchi made a face—the universal expression of a child confronted with adult wisdom he found impractical—and returned to his meal.

---

The conversation drifted to practical matters.

"You mentioned work," Sheldon said, when the meal had settled into its middle rhythm. "At the shrine. What would that involve?"

"Maintenance, primarily. The grounds need tending—weeding, sweeping, repairs when weather allows. The steps need regular attention. Visitors require assistance." Katsuhito set down his chopsticks. "It is not demanding work, but it is constant. A shrine is a living thing, Tsukino-san. It must be cared for, or it dies."

"I understand."

"Do you? Perhaps." The priest's eyes held something Sheldon couldn't read. "You said you were a... what was the word? A scientist?"

The question caught him off guard. He hadn't said what he was. Had he? The memories of his earlier conversation were foggy, like everything else.

"I was. Am. I studied physics. Theoretical work, mostly, though my last position was more practical."

"Physics." Katsuhito said the word carefully, as if testing its weight. "The study of how things work."

"The study of why things work the way they do. The underlying laws that govern reality."

"Ah." The priest smiled. "Then you and I are in similar businesses, Tsukino-san. I also study the underlying laws that govern reality. I simply call them by different names."

---

Tenchi began to flag around eight o'clock.

His head drooped over his rice bowl, catching itself, drooping again. The energy that had carried him through the afternoon was finally fading, and Sheldon watched the boy fight against sleep with the stubborn determination of childhood.

"Tenchi," Katsuhito said gently. "Finish your rice and say goodnight. You have school tomorrow."

"I'm not tired."

"Of course not. Nevertheless, finish your rice."

The boy complied with the slow, exaggerated movements of someone who was definitely not tired. His final bite of rice took approximately thirty seconds to chew. His goodbye bow to Sheldon was careful and formal, though his eyes were already half-closed.

"Goodnight, Sheru-nii."

"Goodnight, Tenchi-kun. Sleep well."

"You'll be here tomorrow?"

The question was simple, but something in it made Sheldon's throat tighten. The boy wasn't asking out of curiosity. He was asking out of need—the need of a child who had already lost too many people, already learned that presence was not guaranteed.

"Yes," Sheldon said. "I'll be here."

Tenchi nodded once, satisfied, and shuffled out of the room toward wherever his bed waited. His footsteps faded down the hall, followed by the slide of a door opening and closing.

Silence settled over the table.

---

Katsuhito poured sake into a small cup—just one, Sheldon noticed. The priest didn't offer him any.

"He likes you," Katsuhito said, sipping. "Tenchi. He does not warm to people easily. Not anymore."

"He mentioned his grandmother. That she's gone."

"His mother." The priest's voice was flat. Careful. "Kiyone. She died last year. Illness that came on quickly and did not respond to treatment."

*His mother.* Not grandmother. Sheldon had misunderstood.

"I'm sorry."

"So am I." Katsuhito looked toward the door where Tenchi had disappeared. "She was a remarkable woman. Kind and fierce in equal measure. Tenchi has her eyes."

Sheldon thought of the boy's face—serious, watchful, older than its years. "He seems... well-adjusted, for a child who's experienced that kind of loss."

"He is resilient. Children often are, when they are given space to grieve without being overwhelmed by the grief of others." The priest finished his sake and set the cup down. "His father visits on weekends. Works in the city during the week. It is... a compromise. Not ideal, but manageable."

"And you take care of him the rest of the time?"

"I do what I can. An old man's care is not the same as a parent's, but it is what we have." Katsuhito met Sheldon's eyes directly. "You are good with him, Tsukino-san. He saw something in you. I do not know what. But he saw it."

Sheldon didn't know how to respond to that. He had no experience with children—none that he remembered, anyway. His life had been equations and laboratories and the cold precision of particle physics. Nothing that would have prepared him to be seen by a grieving four-year-old.

But the boy had named him brother. And he had accepted.

"I will try to be worthy of it," he said finally.

Katsuhito nodded once. "That is all any of us can do."

## SCENE 1.7: CLEANUP

**April 3, 1989 — ~20:15 JST**
**Location:** Main residence kitchen
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The dishes did not clean themselves.

Sheldon gathered the bowls and plates from the table with practiced efficiency—rice bowls stacked inside rice bowls, chopsticks bundled, the empty fish plate balanced on top of the pile. Katsuhito watched him with raised eyebrows.

"You need not do that, Tsukino-san. You are a guest."

"Guests who eat should help with the cleaning." The words came out with grandmother's inflection, and Sheldon heard her voice echo in his own. "That's what my grandmother would have said."

"She sounds formidable."

"She was." Sheldon carried the stack to the kitchen sink. "She raised me after my parents died. Taught me that idle hands were worse than useless—they were dangerous. A body that wasn't working was a mind that was wandering into places it shouldn't go."

He turned on the water, testing the temperature with the back of his wrist the way grandmother had taught him. Hot enough to cut grease, cool enough not to damage the lacquer. The balance mattered.

"In that case," Katsuhito said, "I will dry."

---

They worked in companionable silence.

Sheldon washed—rice bowls first, then soup bowls, then the larger plates. His hands moved through the motions automatically: scrub, rinse, pass. The soap was different from what he remembered using in his other life—harder, less foamy, smelling faintly of something he couldn't identify. Citrus, maybe. Or pine.

*Pine.* The word triggered something—a fragment of memory, slippery and incomplete. Pine trees outside a window. A kitchen that wasn't this kitchen. Hands that weren't quite his hands, doing this same work, in a life that felt simultaneously immediate and impossibly distant.

He let it go. The memories would come when they came. Grandmother had taught him that, too.

"You wash dishes like someone who has washed many dishes," Katsuhito observed, accepting a bowl and running his towel over its surface.

"My grandmother believed in self-sufficiency. Like you."

"Did she run a shrine as well?"

Sheldon almost smiled. "No. She cleaned houses for other people. Other people's houses were always cleaner than her own, she used to say, because she spent all her best work there. But our kitchen was spotless. The kitchen was sacred."

"She sounds like a Shinto priest at heart."

"She was a Baptist. Church every Sunday, prayer before every meal, the Bible on her nightstand with passages underlined in red ink." Sheldon passed another bowl. "But I think she would have understood this place. The... intention of it. The care."

Katsuhito dried the bowl and set it aside. "Care is universal, Tsukino-san. It speaks all languages."

---

The kitchen came clean in stages.

Dishes first, then the counters, then the stove—which Katsuhito handled himself, with the particular attention of someone who knew exactly how hot surfaces needed to be treated. The floor received a quick sweep but no mopping; tomorrow's work, Sheldon assumed.

"Leave the cutting board to dry overnight," Katsuhito instructed. "Wood needs to breathe. If you seal it wet, it warps."

Sheldon filed the information away. His mind was filling with new data—kitchen layouts, ingredient locations, the particular rhythms of this household—and each piece felt like a building block. A foundation being laid.

"Masaki-san."

"Hm?"

"Thank you." The words came out awkward, insufficient for what they were trying to carry. "For the meal. For the room. For... all of this. I don't understand why you're helping me, but I'm grateful."

Katsuhito set down his towel and turned to face him. In the kitchen light, the priest's face looked ancient—carved from the same wood as the building around him, weathered by the same centuries of sun and rain.

"The mountain accepted you," he said simply. "I told you this. When the mountain accepts someone, we do not question why. We simply welcome them."

"That's not an answer."

"No." Katsuhito's eyes glinted. "But it is the truth."

---

The kitchen fell silent except for the drip of water from the drying rack.

Sheldon looked around the space—clean now, everything in its place, ready for tomorrow's meals. The evening felt complete in a way he couldn't quite articulate. A cycle closed. An obligation met.

*Never leave a dish in the sink.*

He hadn't. Grandmother would have been satisfied.

"Come," Katsuhito said, draping the towel over a rack to dry. "The day has been long. A cup of tea before bed, I think, and then rest. Tomorrow will bring its own work."

Sheldon nodded and followed the priest out of the kitchen. Behind them, the clean dishes waited in orderly rows, ready to be filled again.

## SCENE 1.8: EVENING TEA

**April 3, 1989 — ~20:45 JST**
**Location:** Main residence engawa
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The engawa was cool beneath him, the wood polished smooth by generations of sitting exactly where he sat now.

Katsuhito had brought the tea to the veranda rather than a sitting room—"The evening is mild," he'd said, "and the stars are worth seeing"—and now they sat side by side, looking out at the darkness. The shrine grounds were quiet, the buildings just visible as darker shapes against the sky. Above them, stars scattered across the black like spilled salt.

Sheldon sipped his tea. It was different from the afternoon's offering—lighter, slightly bitter, the kind of tea that seemed designed to settle the mind rather than stimulate it.

"What do you see?" Katsuhito asked.

Sheldon looked at the sky, trying to understand the question. "Stars. The mountain. Darkness."

"And?"

He looked more carefully. The stars were bright here—brighter than anything he remembered from his previous life, certainly. No city lights to compete with. No ambient glow to dilute the darkness. Just the stars themselves, scattered across the sky in patterns he almost recognized.

"Orion," he said, finding the constellation. "The belt, there. And... Sirius, I think. The bright one, low on the horizon."

"You know the stars."

"I know some of them. My grandmother used to point them out when I was young. She said her grandmother had done the same for her—different stories, maybe, but the same stars."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "The stars are one of the few things that truly connect us to our ancestors. They saw what we see. They wondered what we wonder. The distance between us and them is nothing compared to the distance between us and the stars."

Sheldon turned the idea over in his mind. It was the kind of thought he would have dismissed once—poetic but impractical, the sort of thing scientists learned to set aside in favor of measurable reality. But sitting here, under this sky, in this place he'd never been before and couldn't explain arriving at, the words felt different.

"My grandmother believed in Heaven," he said. "Up there, among the stars. She said the people we lost were watching us from the sky."

"And what do you believe?"

The question was gentle, without judgment. Sheldon took another sip of tea before answering.

"I believe I don't know enough to believe anything. I thought I understood how the universe worked. I spent thirty years studying the laws that govern matter and energy, the rules that determine what is possible and what isn't." He paused. "And then I woke up in a field with no memory of how I got there, and everything I thought I knew became insufficient."

"Ah." Katsuhito's voice held something that might have been approval. "That is a good beginning, Tsukino-san."

"A beginning of what?"

"Understanding." The priest set down his cup. "The wise man knows that he knows nothing. The fool believes he knows everything. You are somewhere in between—you once thought you knew, and now you are learning that you did not. That is uncomfortable. But it is also necessary."

The stars turned slowly overhead—too slowly to see, but Sheldon knew they were moving. Everything moved. Everything changed. Even the things that seemed permanent were only persistent.

"What should I do?" he asked. "Tomorrow. The day after. All the days after that."

"What do you want to do?"

"I don't know."

"Then do what is in front of you." Katsuhito rose, collecting both tea cups with practiced ease. "Sweep the steps. Tend the grounds. Help with the cooking. Learn the rhythms of this place. The wanting will come when you are ready for it."

Sheldon stood as well, his body unfolding from the seated position with the same unsettling ease that had marked all his movements today. "And if it doesn't?"

The priest looked at him—really looked, with eyes that seemed to see more than the surface.

"It will," Katsuhito said. "The mountain does not accept people at random, Tsukino-san. You are here for a reason. The reason will reveal itself when it is ready."

"You keep saying that. The mountain accepted me. What does that mean?"

"Goodnight, Tsukino-san." Katsuhito smiled and turned toward the interior of the house. "Sleep well. Tomorrow begins early."

He was gone before Sheldon could ask again.

## SCENE 1.9: NIGHT WALK

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:00 JST**
**Location:** Shrine grounds, covered walkway
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The covered walkway was darker than Sheldon expected.

A few lanterns hung at intervals, their light soft and yellow, casting more shadows than illumination. The wooden boards creaked beneath his feet—a different sound from the daytime, when the creaks had been lost in the ambient noise of wind and birds and distant conversation. Now each step announced itself, a small declaration of existence in the quiet.

He walked slowly. There was no reason to hurry.

The shrine at night was different from the shrine during the day. The same buildings, the same paths, the same mountain rising behind everything—but transformed by darkness into something more essential. The decorative elements disappeared. The colors faded. What remained was shape and shadow and the sense of immense age pressing down from all directions.

The great tree was barely visible from here, but Sheldon could feel it. A presence at the edge of his awareness, patient and attentive. He wondered if trees slept. He wondered if this tree ever did.

*You are here for a reason. The reason will reveal itself when it is ready.*

Katsuhito's words echoed in his mind. Cryptic. Frustrating. And somehow, inexplicably comforting. There was an answer out there—an explanation for the field and the documents and the body that didn't hurt. He just had to wait for it.

Sheldon had never been good at waiting.

---

A night bird called from somewhere in the darkness—not the three-note song he'd heard in the field, but something lower, more mournful. An owl, perhaps. The sound lingered in the air, then faded into silence.

He paused at a point where the walkway opened slightly, offering a view of the shrine grounds. The moon was rising over the mountain—not full, but bright enough to cast faint shadows. In its light, the main hall looked like something from a woodblock print, all clean lines and ancient geometry.

*I should not be here.*

The thought arrived unbidden, and he examined it carefully. It was true, in one sense—he had no logical reason to be here, no explanation that would satisfy the version of himself that had existed before today. A dead physicist from Alaska did not wake up in Japanese fields. A man with no memory of the journey did not find houses waiting for him at the top of mountain shrines. These things did not happen.

And yet.

He was here. The shrine was real beneath his feet. The mountain rose behind him, ancient and patient. The stars turned overhead, the same stars his grandmother had pointed out in Georgia a lifetime ago.

*Maybe the reason I'm here isn't logical,* he thought. *Maybe logic isn't the right tool for this particular problem.*

It was a strange thought for a physicist. Strange and uncomfortable and somehow, in this moment, exactly right.

---

The guest room door slid open easily under his hand.

Inside, everything was as he'd left it—the low table, the window looking toward the mountain, the futon cabinet against the wall. His wallet and watch sat where he'd placed them, waiting to confirm that this was real, that he had possessions, that he existed in the world in a way that could be documented.

Sheldon stepped inside and slid the door closed behind him.

The sound of it—the soft thunk of wood meeting wood—had a finality to it. Day one, complete. Whatever this was, whatever had happened to him, he had survived the first day of it. He had found food, shelter, people who seemed willing to help him. He had a place to sleep and work promised for tomorrow.

*Water, food, shelter.*

Grandmother's priorities, met. The rest could wait.

## SCENE 1.10: FIRST NIGHT SETUP

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:15 JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The futon cabinet opened with a soft click.

Inside, neatly folded: a mattress pad, a thick comforter, a pillow in a clean cotton case. Everything smelled of cedar and sunshine—stored carefully, aired regularly, waiting for exactly this moment.

Sheldon lifted the mattress and carried it to the center of the room. The weight was nothing. He'd carried heavier things in his previous life—boxes of equipment, stacks of paper, the accumulated detritus of an academic career—but this felt different. Effortless in a way that went beyond the object's actual mass.

He spread the mattress on the tatami, smoothing it flat with hands that moved with more precision than he expected. Then the comforter, folded back at one corner. Then the pillow, centered at the head.

A bed. His bed, for tonight at least.

---

He should change clothes, he realized.

The shirt and slacks he'd been wearing all day—that he'd woken up wearing, in a field, with no memory of putting them on—were dirty now. Grass stains on the slacks from his awakening. A smudge of fish oil on the shirt cuff from dinner preparation. Normal wear from a normal day that had been anything but normal.

But he had no other clothes. The wallet in his pocket contained documents and money, not a change of wardrobe. Whoever had prepared him for this new life had apparently expected him to acquire clothing on his own.

Tomorrow, then. Tonight, he would sleep in what he had.

He undid the buttons of his shirt slowly, pulling it over his head, and paused.

The mirror. There was a small one on the wall near the tokonoma—not large, but enough to show his face and upper body if he stood close.

Sheldon walked to the mirror and looked.

---

The face that looked back was his.

Brown skin, darker than he remembered—or no, not darker, just healthier. The pallid undertone that had marked his years under fluorescent lights was gone. His cheeks had color. His eyes were clear.

He was younger than he expected. Not young, exactly—the lines around his eyes remained, the first traces of gray in his short hair—but younger than thirty-eight. The face in the mirror might have belonged to a man of thirty, perhaps even less. A man who hadn't spent decades squinting at equations, hunching over microscopes, neglecting the body that carried his thoughts.

He looked at his chest. Compact, as it had always been—he was built low to the ground, his grandmother's "little bull," never going to be tall or slender. But the softness he remembered was different now. Not gone, but... firmer. Denser. As if the muscle underneath had been rebuilt according to better specifications.

The scar on his shoulder—from a childhood fall, a broken bottle, twelve stitches in the emergency room—was gone.

He checked his right hand. The apple scar. Gone.

His left knee, which had complained every morning since his twenties. He bent it, straightened it, bent it again. Silence. No creak. No ache. Nothing.

*What happened to me?*

The question had no answer. The mirror showed only what was, not how it had come to be. A body rebuilt. Restored. Made ready for... something.

Something he didn't understand.

---

He turned away from the mirror and finished undressing.

The slacks he folded and set aside—they would need cleaning, but they were salvageable. The shirt might need more work. His shoes, which had survived the mountain climb without apparent damage, he left by the door.

In just his undershorts, he felt vulnerable in a way he hadn't anticipated. Not cold—the room was comfortable, and the comforter waited to wrap him in warmth. But exposed. A stranger in a strange place, with nothing between himself and the world but skin he didn't quite recognize.

He lay down on the futon.

The mattress accepted him perfectly—not too soft, not too firm, molding to his body in a way that suggested it had been waiting for exactly his shape. The pillow cradled his head. The comforter settled over him like a held breath.

He stared at the ceiling and tried to make sense of the day.

## SCENE 1.11: PROCESSING

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:30 JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The ceiling was made of wooden slats, each one fitted precisely against its neighbors.

Sheldon lay in the darkness and counted them. An old habit—his mind needed something to do while it sorted through the day's data, and counting gave it a task that didn't require real attention. Twelve slats across. Five sections visible from where he lay. Sixty slats total, give or take a few hidden by shadow.

*Facts,* grandmother's voice said. *Start with facts.*

He had them. He had more facts than he knew what to do with.

---

Fact: He had died.

The memory was clear—clearer than anything else, actually. The laboratory in Alaska. The particle accelerator, humming with energy that had taken months to accumulate. The cascade failure that had begun as a whisper and ended as a scream.

Maria Chen's face through the observation window.

He had worked with Maria for two years. She was brilliant—one of the best experimental physicists of her generation—and she had trusted him with calculations that would determine whether their work succeeded or failed. In the end, the calculations had been correct. The failure had come from somewhere else—a component that should have held and didn't, a stress fracture invisible to every inspection.

He had seen her eyes when she realized what was happening. The horror. The helplessness. The love she had never spoken and he had never acknowledged.

*Oh.*

That had been his last thought. Not regret for the work left undone, not fear of what came next. Just a small, quiet recognition that the story was ending.

And then it hadn't.

---

Fact: He was alive.

Not just alive—more alive than he had ever been. His body worked in ways it hadn't worked for years. Decades, maybe. The chronic aches were gone. The limitations he'd learned to navigate around had vanished. He could climb three hundred twenty steps without breathing hard. He could sit in seiza for an hour without his legs going numb.

Someone had fixed him. Rebuilt him. Made him into a better version of the person he'd been.

*Who?*

The question had no answer. Or rather, it had too many possible answers, each more impossible than the last. Divine intervention. Advanced technology. Some kind of dream from which he would eventually wake.

But the futon was real beneath him. The air was real in his lungs. The hunger he'd felt before dinner and the satisfaction he felt now—those were real too. Dreams didn't work this way. Dreams didn't have this kind of consistency, this attention to detail.

This wasn't a dream.

---

Fact: He was in Japan.

Okayama Prefecture, specifically. A mountain shrine with three hundred twenty steps and an old priest who spoke in riddles and a child who had named him brother. A house that apparently belonged to his family—a family he didn't remember having, whose documents sat in his wallet, whose history stretched back generations.

Tsukino Sheldon. Born March 15, 1959. Address in Okayama. Bank accounts with money he'd never earned. A family registry that traced his lineage through parents and grandparents he had no memory of.

Someone had created an identity for him. Not just a body—an entire life. A history. A place in the world.

*Why?*

Another question without an answer. Another mystery to add to the pile.

---

He turned on his side, pulling the comforter tighter.

The facts weren't enough. They never were, really—facts were the raw material of understanding, not understanding itself. A physicist knew this better than most. You could measure a phenomenon perfectly and still have no idea why it happened. The universe didn't owe explanations to the people who observed it.

But grandmother had taught him something else. Something that came before facts, before analysis, before the careful construction of theories.

*When you don't know what to do, do what's in front of you.*

What was in front of him: a bed. A room. A promise to a child that he would be there tomorrow.

He couldn't explain why he was here. He couldn't trace the chain of causation that had led from a laboratory in Alaska to a futon in Japan. But he could keep the promise. He could be there when Tenchi woke up.

*That's something,* he thought. *That's a start.*

The ceiling slats blurred slightly as his eyes began to close. Twelve across. Five sections. Sixty slats total.

Tomorrow would bring more facts. More questions. More of this impossible life that he somehow had to learn to live.

But for now—for this moment—he had a place to sleep. A roof over his head. People who had welcomed him without asking why.

That was enough.

**April 3, 1989 — ~21:45 JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

Somewhere outside, an owl called.

The sound was soft, muffled by distance and walls, but it reached Sheldon through the settling silence of the room. A low hoot, repeated once, then fading into the night. The owl was hunting, probably. Doing what owls did, regardless of the impossible things happening in the human world.

He thought about the owl. The way it existed without questions. The way it moved through its life following instincts that had served its ancestors for millennia.

*Must be nice,* he thought, and almost smiled.

---

The tears came without warning.

One moment he was lying still, his body heavy with exhaustion, his mind finally beginning to quiet. The next moment his eyes were burning and his throat was tight and something was breaking loose inside his chest that he hadn't known was held there.

He didn't sob. The tears simply fell—sliding down his temples, soaking into the pillow beneath his head. Silent. Steady. The accumulated pressure of a day that had demanded too much releasing itself in the only way his body knew how.

*I died.*

The thought arrived with the tears, and this time he didn't push it away. He let it sit. Let it be true.

He had died. In a laboratory in Alaska, surrounded by equipment he'd spent years learning to use, watched by a woman who had loved him without ever saying so. His heart had stopped. His lungs had emptied. The electrical activity in his brain had ceased, and for some unmeasurable span of time, Sheldon Carter had not existed.

And then he had woken up in a field with grass against his cheek and a new name and a body that didn't hurt.

*Why?*

He didn't know. Might never know. But lying here in the darkness, tears cooling on his skin, he felt something shift—some barrier inside himself that had been holding since the moment he opened his eyes.

He was alive. Against all logic, against all expectation, against everything he thought he understood about how the universe worked—he was alive. And that was terrifying. And that was a miracle. And those two things could both be true at the same time.

*Thank you.*

The words formed in his mind without a specific recipient. Thank you to whoever had done this. Thank you to whatever force had seen fit to give him another chance. Thank you to his grandmother, who had taught him to keep moving when everything fell apart. Thank you to the owl, still hunting in the darkness. Thank you to the pillow absorbing his tears.

Thank you.

---

Sleep came in stages.

First the heaviness in his limbs, spreading from his feet upward like warm water filling a vessel. Then the softening of his thoughts, the edges blurring, the sharp questions dissolving into shapeless wondering. Then the darkness behind his eyes deepening, becoming not the absence of light but something more active—a presence, a destination.

He thought of Tenchi's face. The serious eyes. The nickname that had settled on him like a gift he hadn't known he wanted.

*Sheru-nii.*

He thought of Katsuhito's smile. The riddles. The tea served without questions.

*The mountain accepted you.*

He thought of the stairs. The tree. The kitchen. The fish. The stars.

He thought of nothing.

And then, finally, mercifully, he slept.

## SCENE 1.13: FIRST NIGHT SLEEP

**April 3, 1989 — ~22:00+ JST**
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon (dream POV)

---

In his dreams, he was in his grandmother's kitchen.

Not the kitchen as he'd last seen it—cramped and aging, the linoleum peeling in the corners, the refrigerator humming its dying song. This was the kitchen of his childhood, impossibly vast, every surface gleaming with the attention she had lavished on it. The smell of cornbread filled the air. Late afternoon light slanted through windows that sparkled like they'd been polished with angels' breath.

Grandmother stood at the stove, her back to him, her housedress the faded blue he remembered from a thousand mornings.

"You're late," she said without turning around.

"I know."

"Supper's almost cold."

"I'm sorry."

She turned then, and her face was the face he remembered—round and soft and lined with the years she'd lived before he was born. Her eyes were kind. They had always been kind, even when she was scolding him.

"You always say sorry," she said. "Like it changes things."

"Doesn't it?"

"No. But you say it anyway. That's why I love you."

She held out her hand, and he stepped forward to take it—

---

—and the kitchen dissolved.

He was in the field again. The grass pressed against his cheek. The sky stretched overhead, blue and vast and empty.

But something was different this time.

Someone was standing at the edge of his vision. A figure in white, tall and slender, their features unclear in the bright light. They were watching him. Not moving. Just watching.

He tried to turn his head to see them clearly, but his body wouldn't cooperate. Dream-logic. The figure stayed at the periphery, always just out of focus, always just beyond recognition.

"Who are you?" he asked, though his lips didn't move.

The figure didn't answer. But something in the way they stood—patient, gentle, infinitely sad—made him feel that they knew him. Knew everything about him. Had always known.

The grass rustled without wind.

The figure began to fade.

"Wait—"

---

He woke once in the night.

Not fully—just enough to register the darkness, the unfamiliar ceiling, the weight of the comforter across his chest. The dream was already slipping away, dissolving into fragments that his conscious mind couldn't hold.

A kitchen. A field. Someone watching.

He couldn't remember who.

The owl called again outside, and the sound was comforting somehow. Real. Present. A reminder that the world continued even when he wasn't conscious to observe it.

Sheldon turned on his side, pulled the comforter higher, and let sleep take him again.

This time, there were no dreams.

Just darkness, and rest, and the slow passage of hours toward morning.

---

Outside the window, the mountain watched him sleep.

The great tree's branches moved slightly in the night breeze—or perhaps not in the breeze at all. Perhaps in response to something else. Something that had arrived today. Something that had changed the patterns of the shrine in ways too subtle to measure but impossible to ignore.

The stars turned overhead. The owl found its prey and fell silent. The shrine settled into the deep quiet of the late hours, when even the birds slept and only the mountain remained awake.

Day one was complete.

Whatever came next would begin with morning.
