# Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Comprehensive Planning Document

**Document Version:** 2.0 (VERIFIED FROM PAST CONVERSATIONS)  
**Compiled:** December 29, 2025  
**Scope:** Death → Arrival → Pre-Canon → Canon → Post-Canon → Departure

---

## PART I: JUMP MECHANICS (CONFIRMED)

### 1.1 Cosmos's Approach to Jump Perks

**CONFIRMED (December 2025 conversations):**

> "The benefactor sets the limits on points. As Sailor Cosmos chose this first Universe for him, the perks/grants specific to this world are put on hold until he's settled enough in this world to communicate with him fully."

**Key Confirmed Mechanics:**
1. Jump perks are **NOT front-loaded** on arrival
2. They're held back until Cosmos can communicate properly (~Year 1 anniversary)
3. This is Cosmos doing it **her way**, modifying standard JumpChain arrival
4. Sheldon does NOT choose/roll his own build — Cosmos built it for him

### 1.2 Sheldon's Origin: DROP-IN with SCIENTIST Perks

**CONFIRMED:** Sheldon would technically be a Drop-In, BUT Cosmos gave him all the needed **Scientist perks** when she created his new family background. He has the **Slice of Life versions** of perks and drawbacks.

**Scientist Perk Track (ALL FOUR TIERS CONFIRMED):**

| Tier | Perk | Slice of Life Effect |
|------|------|---------------------|
| 100cp | **Simple Scientific Solution** | Create supertech improvements to common tools and appliances |
| 200cp | **Technobabel Fish** | Flawlessly understand any technical terminology; can explain to anyone |
| 400cp | **Super Study Buddy** | People who study/train with you don't require sleep while learning; legendary passion for teaching |
| 800cp | **The Maddest Science Yet** | Build amazing inventions; **nothing made by your hands can harm people unintentionally** |

**CONFIRMED:** Cosmos saw the dangers and stacked heavily in favor of her child.

### 1.3 The Revelation Rule (CONFIRMED)

- **Cosmos CAN tell Sheldon everything** about JumpChain — allowed within the system
- **Sheldon CANNOT reveal JumpChain** to universe natives
- After first anniversary reveal: Sheldon knows he's in a JumpChain, knows the mechanics

### 1.4 The Tsukino Family (CONFIRMED)

**CRITICAL:** When Cosmos places Sheldon in a universe, she rewrites causality to create genuine history. The Tsukino family genuinely existed. Sheldon is genuinely their descendant. This is his actual history, not a disguise.

---

## PART II: DUAL POWER SYSTEM (CONFIRMED)

### 2.1 Two Separate Systems Stacking

**CONFIRMED:**

1. **Tenchi Muyo Jump perks** — On hold until settled, Cosmos can communicate properly
2. **Celestial Pack abilities** — Separate strategic gifts Cosmos provides directly (like Supreme Chef)

She's layering both, but the Jump perks come later. The Celestial Pack is what's active during the early story.

### 2.2 First Anniversary Revelation (CONFIRMED)

**When:** By his first anniversary at the latest (April 3, 1990)

**What Cosmos Reveals:**
- How he died in detail
- How she found his star seed
- How she made him her son by healing said star seed
- The JumpChain mechanics

---

## PART III: POWER PROGRESSION (CONFIRMED)

### 3.1 Five-Phase System

| Phase | Years | Manifestation |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **I** | 1-3 | EXCEPTIONAL HUMAN: Natural talent, intuition, luck. "He's just really good at cooking." No supernatural tells. |
| **II** | 4-12 | SUBTLE SUPERNATURAL: Slightly beyond human limits. "Uncanny" moments. Yosho notices. Washu would notice instantly if present. |
| **III** | 13-50 | CLEAR SUPERNATURAL: First LHW manifests during Kagato arc. Powers undeniable. |
| **IV** | 51-200 | LEGENDARY: Multiple wings, conscious control. |
| **V** | 200+ | COSMIC: Full Lambda Power access. Peer to Chousin in scope if not origin. |

### 3.2 Light Hawk Wing Progression (CONFIRMED)

**Sheldon's Maximum:** 13 wings (dormant) — Cosmos operates outside dimensional limits

| Stage | Wings Available | Stability |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| First Manifestation | 1-3 | Unstable; exhausting |
| Early Phase III | 3 stable, 4 with effort | Building control |
| Mid Phase III | 5 | "The wall" — body remembers cascade |
| Crisis Event | 13 (full release) | Unsustainable; damages him |
| Post-Crisis Recovery | Back to 3 | Rebuilding properly |
| Phase IV | 5-10 | Controlled access |
| Phase V | 13 | Sustainable mastery |

**The 13-Wing Crisis Moment:**
> "Everything you could ever become—you reached for it all at once."

Sheldon forces full manifestation in a crisis. His body isn't ready. He survives but spends months/years rebuilding from 3 wings upward.

### 3.3 Lambda Power (CONFIRMED)

**Lambda Infusion (HIDDEN):** All food Sheldon cooks carries trace Lambda energy. Those who eat feel warmer, safer, more loved. Sheldon **never consciously learns** about this. Washu eventually detects it but keeps quiet.

## PART VII: CHARACTER PROFILE — SHELDON CARTER/TSUKINO

### 7.1 Identity (CONFIRMED)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Sheldon Tsukino (née Carter) |
| **Birth** | August 21, 1987, Griffin, GA |
| **Raised** | Jackson, GA |
| **Death** | October 23, 2025, University of Alaska Fairbanks |
| **Race** | Black American |
| **Height** | 5'4" |
| **Build** | Stocky |
| **Sexuality** | Gay (used work to avoid relationships) |

### 7.2 Education (CONFIRMED — LEGITIMATE)

| PhD | Institution | Field |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| #1 | MIT | Theoretical Physics |
| #2 | Stanford | Applied Mathematics |
| #3 | Caltech | Quantum Mechanics |
| #4 | Berkeley | Astrophysics |

**CRITICAL:** It would be ABSURD for a physicist with four PhDs to claim his grandmother taught him physics. The "grandmother excuse" is for:
- Inexplicably perfect sewing skills
- Restaurant-quality Southern cooking
- Knowledge of alien tech he's never seen
- Repair intuition that borders on supernatural

### 7.3 Death Circumstances (CONFIRMED)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Date** | October 23, 2025 |
| **Location** | University of Alaska Fairbanks, particle accelerator lab |
| **Witness** | Dr. Maria Chen-Vasquez (colleague) |
| **Other Character** | Dr. Morrison (nervous colleague — NOT the witness) |
| **Cause** | Particle accelerator accident |

---

## PART VIII: FORBIDDEN TERMINOLOGY (CONFIRMED)

### In Sheldon's POV (Until Learned On-Page):

**NEVER USE:**
- Cosmos, Sailor
- Ryoko, Washu, Tsunami, Kagato
- Ayeka, Sasami
- Jurai, Royal Tree, Galaxy Police
- Phase I/II/III (meta-terminology)
- "remade," Lambda

**SAFE REFERENCES FOR HIS BENEFACTOR:**
- "the system"
- "the presence"
- "his benefactor"
- "whatever brought him here"

---

## PART VIII: SHELDON × YOSHO RELATIONSHIP (CONFIRMED)

### 8.1 Overview

The relationship develops over DECADES, not chapters. Both are old souls who understand patience. The slow burn is canonical.

**Critical Rule:** The romance CANNOT begin until Yosho reveals his true identity. Until then, Sheldon sees an old priest/mentor figure, not a potential partner. The Year 13 revelation recontextualizes everything.

### 8.2 Five-Phase Progression (CONFIRMED)

| Phase | Years | Development |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | 1-7 | **ASSESSMENT & TRUST**: Yosho observes, tests, evaluates. Sheldon proves himself through consistent action, patience, care for Tenchi. Trust is earned, not given. |
| **2** | 8-10 | **ALLIES & FRIENDS**: Shared responsibilities deepen trust. Yosho relies on Sheldon emotionally. Emotional intimacy through routine. |
| **3** | 11-17 | **EMOTIONAL BONDING**: Canon events pressure the family. Sheldon and Yosho become each other's steadying force. Yosho reveals parts of his past hidden for centuries. Sheldon becomes indispensable. Understated romantic tension, unspoken depth, NOT acted upon. |
| **4** | 18-35 | **LIFE PARTNERS IN ALL BUT NAME**: Decades of shared living. Function as unified leadership pair. Both feel affection beyond friendship but remain patient. Villagers quietly assume they're partners. |
| **5** | 36+ | **THE CHOICE TO LOVE**: After Tenchi's adulthood stabilizes, Sheldon and Yosho formally choose each other. Vows in a shrine ceremony. Yosho proposes using the Bond-to-His-Ship gesture from Juraian tradition. |

### 8.3 Key Moments

| Year | Moment |
|------|--------|
| 4 | Sheldon's Truth: First major vulnerability shared |
| 13 | Yosho's Truth: The great reversal; everything changes |
| 25 | First Admission: Feelings acknowledged (not acted upon) |
| 50 | Physical Contact: First non-incidental touch |
| 100 | Commitment: Formal partnership |

### 8.4 Why It Works

Yosho has been **effectively alone for centuries**. His marriages:
- To Ayeka (void due to Jurai law)
- To Airi (estranged — she left)
- To Kasumi (deceased ~700 years ago)

**What Sheldon Represents:**
- Someone who might stay (long-lived potential)
- A partner who understands secrets
- Relief from isolation
- A new chapter after centuries

---

## PART IX: GAPS STILL REQUIRING DECISIONS

1. **Complete Celestial Pack grant list** — ~70 grants confirmed, but full documentation spread across multiple sessions
2. **Tsukino family details** — Aunt who wrote the letter, 1987 date connection
3. **Sheldon-Yosho children** — Two children confirmed (born 2028 and 2030, Juraian-Cosmic hybrid)
4. **Post-canon adventure specifics** — Years 14-25 detailed events
5. **Century-by-century millennium events** — Major milestones in Years 100-900

---

## PART X: THE GRANDMOTHER EXCUSE (CONFIRMED)

### What It Covers

The "grandmother taught me" running joke is for abilities that make NO sense for a physicist:

**APPROPRIATE for Grandmother Excuse:**
- Inexplicably perfect sewing skills
- Restaurant-quality Southern cooking
- Knowledge of alien tech he's never seen
- Repair intuition that borders on supernatural

**NOT APPROPRIATE (Sheldon has legitimate credentials):**
- Physics, mathematics, quantum mechanics, engineering principles
- Scientific methodology, lab work, research techniques
- Any "hard science" knowledge

### Evolution of the Joke

**Year 5:**
> "How did you make that quilt? It's professional quality."
> "My grandmother taught me."

**Year 50:**
> "This food literally has healing properties."
> "Old family recipe."

**Year 200:**
> "You just repaired a Juraian device you've never seen before."
> "...I had a very comprehensive grandmother."

**Year 500 (Washu):**
> "You understood that dimensional calculation instantly."
> "I have four PhDs, Washu. That's literally my field."
> "Fair. But explain the embroidery skills."
