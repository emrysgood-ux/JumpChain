**13.3 --- Day 1 Awakening Location: The Field**

Where Sheldon first wakes --- the starting point of his new life.
Located in agricultural area between Kamogata town and the shrine.

Physical Description

Terrain: Gentle slope, ankle-high grass, scattered small purple
wildflowers

Orientation: Slopes upward toward treeline to the north

Nearby: Road visible approximately quarter-mile to the south

Soil: Dense, dark, rich --- undisturbed growth, recently rained on but
not yet dried

Distance from shrine: Several kilometers --- requires bus to reach
village

Sensory Details

Smell: Green grass, damp earth, growing things, distant woodsmoke, faint
floral notes

Sound: Bird calls (see: Three-Note Bird below), wind through grass,
distant rural sounds

Touch: Cool damp grass, soft yielding soil, spring breeze

Sight: Deep blue sky, white clouds, treeline north, road south,
mountains in distance

Temperature: Mild spring warmth, comfortable, sunlight diffuse through
occasional clouds

Flora

Grass: Ankle-high, cool and slightly damp, individual blades distinct
under fingers

Purple Wildflowers: Sumire (Japanese Violet)

Species: Sumire (菫) --- Japanese Violet (Viola mandshurica and related
species)

Appearance: Small (2-3 cm), five-petaled flowers in shades of purple to
lavender; heart-shaped leaves

Blooming: March to May --- perfect for early April; scattered through
fields and forest edges

Growth pattern: Low to ground; clustered in patches; prefers partial
shade but tolerates open fields

Scent: Faint, sweet fragrance detectable when close to ground

Cultural meaning: Symbolizes faithfulness, modesty, and sincerity in
Japanese flower language

Sheldon's perception: Doesn't know the species; sees only 'small purple
flowers, delicate, unfamiliar'

*📝 These flowers don't grow in Georgia or California. Another sign
Sheldon is somewhere entirely new.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Sumire's meaning --- faithfulness --- quietly echoes the
story's themes. Cosmos chose this field. Even the flowers mean
something.*

Treeline (north): Dense forest climbing hillside; Japanese cedar (sugi)
mixed with broader-leafed deciduous species

Treeline character: 'Settled quality, an ancientness' --- not tall by
American standards but deeply rooted

Comparison: Nothing like California redwoods or Pacific Northwest
old-growth; different kind of permanence

The Three-Note Bird: Uguisu (Japanese Bush Warbler)

Species: Uguisu (鶯) --- Japanese Bush Warbler (Horornis diphone)

Call pattern: 'Hō-hoke-kyo' (ホーホケキョ) --- long introductory 'hooo'
followed by rapid 'hokekyo'

Why 'three notes': Sheldon, unfamiliar with the call, perceives it as
three questioning notes with pause

Cultural significance: THE iconic spring bird of Japan; its call signals
spring's arrival; celebrated in poetry for centuries

Appearance: Small (14cm), olive-brown, pale eyebrows; rarely seen,
almost always heard

Behavior: Secretive; hides in dense undergrowth; more often heard than
seen

Timing: Males sing from early spring; perfect for April 3rd setting

Habitat: Bamboo thickets, forest edges, dense shrubs --- all present
near awakening field

*📝 Sheldon doesn't know this bird. To him, it's just an unfamiliar call
--- beautiful, questioning, marking time. Later, he'll learn its name
and cultural weight.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: The uguisu's call punctuates Sheldon's resurrection.
Spring announcing itself. New life beginning. The symbolism is not lost
on Cosmos.*

Story Application

Scene 1: Bird calls as Sheldon wakes --- 'three notes, high and
questioning'

Scene 6: Heard again at shrine --- continuity of sound

Scene 9: Morning at shrine --- the call now familiar, comforting

Future: Sheldon learns it's called uguisu; realizes it's Japan's herald
of spring; understands the poetry of his arrival

Recurring motif: The uguisu's call becomes his auditory anchor to this
new life

Why This Location?

Cosmos's choice: Close enough to reach shrine by public transit, far
enough to require journey

Symbolic: Open field = blank slate; must walk toward his new life, not
be placed directly in it

Practical: Rural enough to avoid witnesses, accessible enough to not
strand him
