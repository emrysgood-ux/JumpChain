# EPIC TIMELINE PLANNING FRAMEWORK
## Son of Cosmos: 1000-Year Microsecond Planning System
## Version 1.0

---

# OVERVIEW

This framework enables granular planning across 1,000 years by combining:
1. **Three Power Systems** (JumpChain Perks + Celestial Pack Grants + Lambda Power)
2. **Existing Protocols** (reusable templates and standards)
3. **Nested Timeline Structure** (millennium → century → decade → year → arc → scene)

**Goal:** Plan every significant moment across 1,000 years with traceable connections between power evolution, relationship development, and story beats.
