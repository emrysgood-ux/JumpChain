# DEVIATION POINTS (LOCKED DECISIONS)

## D001: Kiyone Anniversary Response (August 1989)
**Decision: B+C HYBRID** - Participate AND serve

Sheldon both participates in the cemetery visit with family AND handles shrine duties. Key moment: "Thank you for letting me come" / "Thank you for asking."

## D002: Sports Day Public Role (October 1989)
**Decision: PATH C** - Attend as family

Sheldon sits with Yosho, cheers for Tenchi's race, catches him after. Key moment: "Did you see? Did you see?" / "I saw. You were incredible."

## D003: Hatsuyume Content (January 1990)
**Decision: PATH B** - Grandmother dream

Dorothy Mae appears in dream, says "You found your people, baby. I'm proud of you." Full scene with kitchen, catfish, cornbread. Waking with tears and peace.

### Thematic Coherence
All three decisions prioritize:
- Vulnerability over distance
- Presence over performance
- Connection over competence
- Grief as bridge
