## Overview

Washu Hakubi, as one of the three Chousin goddesses, possesses sensors and analytical capabilities beyond any technology in the known universe. Within moments of her release in Year 13, she detects Sheldon's anomalous energy signature.

---

## Detection Timeline

### Year 13 (2001) — Immediate

**The Moment of Release:**
When Washu emerges from the gems, her first action is a full-spectrum scan of her surroundings. She immediately detects an energy anomaly she has never encountered.

**Initial Scan Results:**
- Energy type: UNKNOWN
- Not Juraian
- Not Masu
- Not standard cosmic radiation
- Not Chousin-derivative
- Pattern: Extremely ordered, almost mathematical
- Comparison: Nothing in 20,000-year database matches

## The Chousin Conference

Shortly after canon events stabilize, Washu contacts her sisters for consultation.

### Participants
- **Washu:** Physical form on Earth
- **Tsunami:** Assimilated with Sasami
- **Tokimi:** Observing from higher dimension

### The Discussion

**WASHU:** "Someone else has been playing in our sandbox."

**TSUNAMI:** "I sense... kinship? But not from us. This being was made with love."

**TOKIMI:** "This is outside our experiment parameters. The energy signature is foreign to our creation."

**WASHU:** "The pattern suggests deliberate design. Someone crafted this person. The question is: who has that capability?"

**TSUNAMI:** "Could it be from another dimensional cluster?"

**TOKIMI:** "Possible. There are cosmologies we cannot perceive. This may be evidence of... neighbors."

## Classification Attempts

### What Washu Tries

| Method | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Standard energy scan | UNKNOWN classification |
| Dimensional resonance | No match to known dimensions |
| Temporal signature | Anomalous — as if created outside time |
| Genetic analysis | Human baseline + unknown enhancement |
| Masu comparison | No Masu markers |
| Juraian comparison | No Juraian markers |
| Chousin signature | NEGATIVE — but similar quality |

### Washu's Conclusion
"Whoever made this person operates at or above Chousin level. They used a power source I cannot identify. And they did it with a precision that suggests deep familiarity with mortal existence."

---

## The Verdict

### Official Classification
**"Protected Anomaly"**

### Terms
- Observe but do not interfere
- Do not attempt to alter or "fix"
- Document all findings
- Respect the creator's apparent intent
- Treat as potential diplomatic contact (if creator ever appears)

### Assignments
**WASHU:** "I claim first investigation rights. This could take centuries."

**TSUNAMI:** "I will observe through Sasami's connection to the household."

**TOKIMI:** "I will watch from outside. If the creator notices our attention, we should be ready."

## Washu's Long-Term Study

### Year 13-50
- Detailed energy mapping
- Behavioral observation
- Ability manifestation tracking
- Longevity confirmation

### Year 50-100
- Comparative analysis with Chousin creations
- Attempt to identify power source (Lambda — eventually named)
- Document relationship patterns

### Year 100+
- Ongoing documentation
- Potential direct conversation with Sheldon about his nature
- Possible attempt to contact his creator

## Key Observations

### What Fascinates Washu

1. **The Craftsmanship:** Sheldon wasn't thrown together. Every aspect of his existence shows careful design.

2. **The Restraint:** The creator gave Sheldon abilities but made them subtle. This suggests wisdom about mortal psychology.

3. **The Love:** Unlike Washu's creations (Ryoko, Kagato), Sheldon was made with apparent affection. No exploitation, no experimentation.

4. **The Purpose:** Sheldon was clearly designed to be a caretaker. His abilities support nurturing, not conquest.

### Washu's Private Assessment
"Whoever made him... they understood something I didn't when I made Ryoko. They understood that creating life is an act of love, not science."

---

## Implications for Story

### Dramatic Irony
Readers know Cosmos created Sheldon. Washu does not.

### Potential Scene
Washu asks Sheldon directly: "Do you know who made you?"
Sheldon: "No. But I know she loved me."
Washu: (pause) "...yes. That's obvious from the work."

### Long-Term Arc
Washu's investigation becomes a subplot spanning centuries. Her eventual meeting with Cosmos (if it ever happens) would be a significant scene.
