# SYSTEM INTERACTION RULES

## Rule 1: Lambda is the Foundation
All other powers flow through the Lambda core. Celestial grants and JumpChain perks are enhanced by Lambda phase.

## Rule 2: Celestial Pack Doesn't Scale
The ~83 grants are fixed in power but their *application* improves with Lambda phase.

## Rule 3: JumpChain Unlocks in Stages
Perks become available as memories unlock. Full access requires full canon recognition.

## Rule 4: Systems Don't Conflict
Cosmos designed the Celestial Pack to complement both Lambda power and JumpChain mechanics. No interference.

## Rule 5: Appearance Lag
Visible power level always lags behind actual power level. Sheldon underplays capabilities.

1. Determine Lambda Phase for Year X
2. All Celestial Pack grants always available
3. Check JumpChain status (locked/partial/full)
4. Apply combined rating from chart
5. Consider circumstance modifiers

## Query 2: How does Sheldon's power appear to Character Y at Year X?
1. Determine what Y knows about Sheldon
2. Check if any grants/abilities revealed to Y
