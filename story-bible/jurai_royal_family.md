## Light Hawk Wings

### What They Are
- Manifestation of Royal Tree power through bonded Juraian
- Can form shields, swords, armor
- Number indicates power level
- Normal maximum: 3 wings

### Tenchi's Anomaly
Tenchi can generate more than 3 wings, suggesting he may be the being the Chousin seek.

### Sheldon's Potential
Lambda power may eventually manifest as Light Hawk Wing equivalent, though from different source.

## Juraian Politics

### The Succession Crisis
- Yosho was Crown Prince, abandoned throne
- Ayeka is current heir
- Tenchi's existence complicates everything
- Multiple factions have preferences

### Seto's Influence
Seto Kamiki controls more actual power than the Emperor:
- Private intelligence network
- Largest personal fleet
- Marriage arrangement authority
- "Devil Princess" reputation

### Earth's Status
Earth is technically "protected territory" due to Yosho's presence. The Juraian Empire monitors but does not interfere.

---

## Cultural Practices

### Marriage
- Political marriages common among royalty
- Multiple spouses permitted
- Children from all marriages have inheritance rights
- Love matches rare but respected

### Longevity
- Royal Tree bond extends lifespan significantly
- Yosho is 700+ years old, appears elderly by choice
- Ayeka is ~720 years, appears young adult
- Natural Juraian lifespan: several hundred years minimum

### Honor Culture
- Formal speech patterns
- Elaborate etiquette
- Dueling traditions
- Family honor paramount

---

## Story Integration

### Phase I Constraints
**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon's POV:**
- Jurai, Juraian
- Royal Tree (except as "the tree")
- Any reference to galactic politics
- Any alien terminology

### Phase III+
- Ayeka and Sasami arrive
- Political implications become subplot
- Tenchi's potential succession becomes issue
- Sheldon navigates alien nobility
