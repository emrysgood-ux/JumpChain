# PART 1: VERIFIED CANON RESEARCH

## 1.1 — Ryoko's Astral Observation (CRITICAL)

**Source:** 101 Secrets of Tenchi Muyo!, Tenchi Muyo FAQ

**Confirmed Facts:**
- Ryoko's astral form CAN observe the shrine grounds while sealed
- She watched Tenchi "all the time" during his childhood
- Tenchi's mother Kiyone deliberately brought young Tenchi near the cave
- Purpose: Allow Ryoko to "experience childhood through Tenchi"
- **Yosho KNEW Ryoko was watching** — this was part of his plan
- Ryoko could project energy: saved Tenchi's cat (Chibi) by keeping it alive
- Her attack on Tenchi in Episode 1 was "mere child's play" — not trying to kill him
- After 700 years of imprisonment ("awake the whole time, feeling damp and cold"), she needed to "let off some steam"

**LOCKED FOR STORY:**
| Fact | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Ryoko observed Sheldon for 12 years (1989-2001) | She knows him before physical release |
| Ryoko watched family dynamics develop | She saw found family being built |
| Ryoko observed cooking, laughter, daily life | She's hungry for that belonging |
| Yosho knew Ryoko was watching | His relationship with Sheldon was observed |
| Ryoko's attack was playful, not lethal | Applies to our version too |

## 1.2 — Washu's Detection Capabilities

**Source:** OVA Episodes, Wiki, Character profiles

**Confirmed Facts:**
- Takes **immediate interest** in anomalies (Tenchi's LHW drew her instantly)
- Can **detect unusual energy sources** even from space (Tenchi in Tokyo)
- Uses **analysis robots** to investigate suspicious entities
- Has **telepathic link** with Ryoko (minds synchronized during imprisonment)
- Creates **inter-dimensional laboratory** beneath house for research
- **Sealed her own goddess powers** in three gems to become mortal
- Generally **trickier to fool** than other household members
- Prefers to solve problems with **reason or technology** rather than innate powers

**Investigation Methods:**
1. Direct scanning with technology
2. Analysis robots deployed covertly
3. Observation over time
4. Consultation with other Chousin (post-OVA 3)

**LOCKED FOR STORY:**
| Fact | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Washu takes immediate interest in anomalies | Will investigate Sheldon quickly |
| She prefers technology over innate powers | May try scientific approach first |
| Her sealed state limits god-perception | Might not immediately recognize Cosmos signature |
| Telepathic link with Ryoko | May learn about Sheldon through Ryoko's memories |

---

## 1.3 — Chousin Nature & Detection Limits

**Source:** OVA 3, Wiki, Character profiles

**Confirmed Facts:**
- Three goddesses: Washu, Tsunami, Tokimi
- Created all of **22-dimensional reality**
- Exist **beyond dimensional space** (hyper-dimensional)
- Were in existence "before time and space began"
- Searching for "a being more powerful than themselves"
- **Cannot prove existence** of being higher than themselves
- Zero (with universe's greatest database) **could not analyze Tokimi** — "registers as not existing at all"
- Even "infinite-dimensional Hilbert Space" insufficient to model Tokimi
- Tenchi manifests as their answer — "Kami Tenchi"

**Critical Implication for Sheldon:**
- Cosmos exists **OUTSIDE** the Tenchi multiverse entirely
- Different cosmic framework (Sailor Moon's cosmology)
- Sheldon might read as **"impossible to categorize"** to Washu's scans
- The Chousin might be **MORE interested in Sheldon than Tenchi**
- Evidence of something outside their creation = evidence of what they seek?

**LOCKED FOR STORY:**
| Fact | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Chousin created this universe | Cosmos didn't — different origin |
| They can't detect entities above them | Sheldon's Cosmos signature may read as "impossible" |
| They seek evidence of higher power | Sheldon could represent that evidence |
| Washu's sealed state limits awareness | Full recognition may require unsealing |

## 1.4 — Zero Infiltration Details

**Source:** OVA Episodes 10-12, Wiki

**Confirmed Facts:**
- Zero given power to duplicate "everything" by Tokimi
- **Could NOT duplicate Ryoko's gems** (contain sealed Chousin power)
- Dr. Clay baffled by this limitation
- Zero **copied Ryoko's emotions** for Tenchi unintentionally
- Emotions **overwrote mission programming**
- Zero defied orders to kill Tenchi

**How Zero was detected:**
1. Washu noticed **Dr. Clay's logo** on Zero's buttocks during bath
2. Physical mark, not energy scanning, revealed the deception
3. Washu was already suspicious due to gem connection (telepathic link)

**Resolution:**
- Zero merged with Ryoko
- Memories of Tokimi erased by D3
- Ryoko became "more honest with her feelings"

**LOCKED FOR STORY:**
| Fact | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Detection came from physical observation | More attentive household might notice faster |
| Emotions overwrote programming | Stable family might accelerate this |
| Gem limitation = Chousin power | Lambda Power might have similar property |
| Merger resolution preserved | Story preserves this outcome |

# PART 2: DECISIONS NEEDED

Based on research, here are the critical decisions with recommended answers:

## 2.1 — Ryoko Release Scene

**Question:** What exactly happens when Ryoko is released?

**Canon Version:**
- Tenchi enters forbidden cave alone
- Breaks seal accidentally
- Ryoko awakens enraged
- Attacks Tenchi; destroys school
- Playful but destructive pursuit
- Tenchi activates Master Key (Tenchi-ken)
- Ryoko cuts short; goes to sleep in his bed

**Key Variables in Our Version:**
| Variable | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Does Sheldon witness release? | Yes/No | **No** — preserves Tenchi's personal awakening |
| Is Sheldon nearby? | Yes/No | **Yes** — at house/shrine, aware something happened |
| Does Yosho intervene faster? | Yes/No | **No** — trusts his plan, waits |
| How does Ryoko react to Tenchi? | Same/Different | **Same initial attack** — she needs the release |
| How does Ryoko react to seeing Sheldon? | Hostile/Curious/Familiar | **Familiar** — she's watched him 12 years |

**RECOMMENDED SCENE:**

Tenchi releases Ryoko → Same initial "playful" attack → Same school destruction → Same pursuit → BUT when Ryoko follows Tenchi home, she sees Sheldon and **recognizes him** from 12 years of observation. This is her first acknowledgment that she's been watching.

**First words to Sheldon could be:** "You're still here." (Acknowledging she watched him arrive and stay)

---

## 2.2 — Sheldon's Role in Kagato Arc

**Question:** Does Sheldon go to Soja? Does he manifest abilities?

**Options:**
| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Observer only | Preserves Tenchi's hero moment | Sheldon feels useless |
| Active support | Shows competence | May overshadow Tenchi |
| Manifests Lambda | Dramatic reveal | Too early? Changes everything |
| Stays on Earth | Protects shrine/Sasami | Removes from action |

**RECOMMENDED DECISION:**

**Sheldon stays on Earth** — specifically to protect Sasami (who stays behind in canon). This:
- Gives Sheldon meaningful role
- Preserves Tenchi's awakening as HIS moment
- Creates parallel scenes: Tenchi confronting Kagato / Sheldon protecting the home
- Allows Washu to encounter Sheldon AFTER Kagato arc, not during

**Lambda manifestation:** NOT during Kagato arc. Too early. Save for Z arc or Shadow arc (original).

---

## 2.3 — Washu Investigation Timeline

**Question:** How quickly does Washu investigate Sheldon? What does she conclude?

**Recommended Timeline:**

| Phase | Timing | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Initial notice | Day 1 of joining household | Senses "something" about Sheldon |
| Passive observation | Weeks 1-4 | Watches without acting |
| First scan | Month 2 | Basic analysis — results anomalous |
| Deeper investigation | Months 3-6 | Multiple approaches, all inconclusive |
| Confrontation | Month 6+ | Direct question to Sheldon |
| Ongoing mystery | Years | Puzzle she never fully solves |

**What Washu Detects:**
1. Power signature doesn't match ANY known classification
2. Not Juraian — wrong frequency
3. Not dimensional traveler — stable presence
4. Divine signature present — but **unfamiliar origin**
5. Conclusion: "Another god's work — but which god?"

**Washu's Investigation Style:**
- Scientific curiosity, not threat assessment
- Treats Sheldon as **puzzle**, not danger
- Respects that he's family before she's investigator
- May share findings with Tsunami (via Sasami link) eventually

---

## 2.4 — Chousin Awareness

**Question:** Do the Chousin notice Cosmos's work?

**Recommended Answer:** **Eventually, yes — but slowly**

| Phase | Awareness Level |
|-------|-----------------|
| Year 14 | Washu notices anomaly, can't categorize |
| Year 15-16 | Washu's investigation ongoing; shares with Tsunami-Sasami |
| Year 17+ (Z Arc) | Chousin formally reunite; discuss Sheldon |
| Post-Z | Chousin aware of "external divine signature" |
| Shadow Arc | Cosmos intervention forces direct acknowledgment |

**Key Principle:** The Chousin don't immediately contact Cosmos. They:
1. Don't know HOW to contact an external entity
2. Are more interested in observing than confronting
3. May see Sheldon as evidence of what they seek (being above them)
4. Eventually recognize they're not alone in creating realities

---

## 2.5 — "Aunt" Dynamic Establishment

**Question:** How does the "aunt" dynamic get established rather than romantic rivals?

**Key Factors:**
1. **Tenchi's different emotional development** — doesn't need validation
2. **Sheldon models healthy relationships** — women see alternative
3. **Existing family structure** — women integrate into family, not competition
4. **Yosho's revealed identity** — complicates Ayeka's romantic expectations

**Recommended Progression:**

| Character | Initial Expectation | Adjustment | Final Role |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| Ryoko | Claim Tenchi | Finds family more appealing | Chaotic Aunt |
| Ayeka | Marry Yosho (or Tenchi) | Discovers Yosho partnered | Proper Aunt (etiquette) |
| Sasami | Be with sister | Finds second family | Little Sister / Cooking Partner |
| Mihoshi | Random arrival | Chaos agent | Ditzy Aunt |
| Washu | Research subject | Family draws her in | Science Aunt |

**Critical Moment:** When Ayeka learns Yosho is alive AND partnered with Sheldon, her entire romantic framework collapses. This is a pivot point for the "aunt" establishment.

---

## 2.6 — Original Arc Placement

**Question:** When does the Shadow Arc occur?

**Previous Discussion Established:**
1. Kagato (canon) - First cosmic threat
2. Dr. Clay/Zero (canon, expanded) - Tokimi hinted
3. Z/Chousin Revelation (canon) - True nature revealed
4. **Shadow Arc (original)** - AFTER Chousin revelation

**Rationale:**
- Z arc establishes Chousin searching for something beyond themselves
- Washu revealed as goddess; Light Hawk Wings have cosmic significance
- Shadow arc can then feature Cosmos intervention with established context
- Creates tension between two cosmic powers (Chousin vs. Cosmos)
- Positions Chousin as potential allies during crisis

**LOCKED:** Shadow Arc occurs post-Z Arc (Year 17+)
