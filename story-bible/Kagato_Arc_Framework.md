# SECTION 2: WHAT CHANGES (DECISIONS)

## Change Assessment Framework

| Element | Canon | Our Story | Reason |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Kagato's arrival** | Same threat | Same threat | His motivation unchanged |
| **Ryoko's capture** | Happens | HAPPENS | Canon event |
| **Pursuit to Soja** | Household goes | Household goes | Same response |
| **Sheldon's participation** | N/A | Goes with household | Family member |
| **Washu's liberation** | Mihoshi accident | Same (Mihoshi accident) | Too good to change |
| **Tenchi's manifestation** | Under extreme duress | Same trigger | Power awakening unchanged |
| **Kagato defeated** | Tenchi wins | Tenchi wins | Canon preserved |

## CRITICAL DECISION: SHELDON'S ROLE

This is the most significant decision point for the Kagato Arc.

### Option A: Sheldon Stays on Earth (Observer)
- Remains at shrine
- Worries from distance
- No direct involvement
- Preserves "normal human" positioning

### Option B: Sheldon Goes to Soja (Participant)
- Accompanies household
- Present during crisis
- Direct witness to cosmic events
- Must justify his presence

### Option C: Sheldon Goes but Limited Role (Background)
- Accompanies household
- Provides support (not combat)
- Witnesses but doesn't influence outcome
- Tenchi still earns victory alone

**LOCKED DECISION:** Option C — Sheldon goes, limited role

**Rationale:**
- Sheldon wouldn't stay behind if family in danger
- His presence doesn't change Tenchi's power awakening
- Creates opportunity for Washu to first notice him
- Maintains Tenchi's hero moment
- More interesting narratively

---

## LOCKED DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Sheldon Accompanies Pursuit

**Rationale:**
- 12 years of family bonding
- Tenchi is effectively his son
- Ryoko has become family (even if recently)
- Sheldon wouldn't passively wait

**Logistics:**
- Ryo-Ohki can accommodate multiple passengers
- Sheldon has no combat capability
- His role is support/witness

**LOCKED:** Sheldon goes to Soja with household.

---

### Decision 2: Sheldon Does NOT Manifest Powers

**Rationale:**
- Lambda Power is dormant (per story bible)
- Activation not triggered by this crisis
- Tenchi MUST be the hero of this arc
- Sheldon's time comes later (Shadow Arc or Z Arc)

**LOCKED:** Sheldon remains unpowered during Kagato Arc.

---

### Decision 3: Sheldon Provides Emotional Support

**Rationale:**
- His role is "foundation" not "warrior"
- Can encourage, steady, support
- Present with non-combatants (Sasami) during battle
- Models calm under extreme pressure

**What He Does:**
- Helps coordinate non-combatants
- Supports Ayeka emotionally when her ship is damaged
- Present when Washu is freed
- Witnesses Tenchi's power awakening
- Provides aftermath support

**LOCKED:** Sheldon's role is support, not combat.

---

### Decision 4: Washu Notices Sheldon Immediately

**Rationale:**
- Washu is the universe's greatest scientist
- She notices anomalies
- Sheldon has "another god's fingerprints"
- She would detect SOMETHING even if she can't classify it

**How She Notices:**
- Fresh from 5,000 years imprisonment
- Scans all new people automatically
- Sheldon's reading is "unusual"
- Files for later investigation (too busy with immediate events)

**LOCKED:** Washu's first impression of Sheldon is "anomalous."

---

### Decision 5: Tenchi's Victory Unchanged

**Rationale:**
- This is Tenchi's story beat
- His Light Hawk Wings manifestation is pivotal
- His defeat of Kagato establishes him as cosmic-level entity
- Sheldon's presence doesn't diminish this

**Canon Preserved:**
- Tenchi manifests 3 Light Hawk Wings
- Single strike destroys Kagato
- Tsunami's intervention happens
- Tenchi's heritage confirmed

**LOCKED:** Tenchi defeats Kagato exactly as canon.

---

### Decision 6: Post-Battle Processing Includes Sheldon

**Rationale:**
- Aftermath involves all survivors
- Sheldon present for conversations
- Helps family process trauma
- First substantive interaction with Washu

**LOCKED:** Sheldon participates in aftermath.
