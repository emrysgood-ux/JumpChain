## KATSUHITO POV — Part 2: Scenes 51-100

**POV:** Masaki Katsuhito (Yosho)  
**Timeline:** 04:44:00 JST — 07:45:00 JST  
**Coverage:** Breakfast Preparation → Tenchi's School Departure → Morning Solitude

---

## SCENE 51
**Time:** 04:44:10 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The kitchen held the accumulated warmth of centuries of meals.

Not literally—the room had been rebuilt twice, the hearth replaced with gas burners thirty years ago—but the feeling persisted. Food had been prepared in this space since before his arrival. The walls remembered the shapes of hands that had worked here, even if the hands themselves had long since turned to dust.

He began breakfast preparations while Tenchi watched from his designated spot by the table.

---

## SCENE 52
**Time:** 04:44:27 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Rice had been soaking since yesterday evening.

He transferred it to the rice cooker—a modern convenience he'd resisted for years before admitting that automation served certain tasks better than attention. The machine hummed to life, beginning its cycle with the particular confidence of devices that performed one function perfectly.

"How long?" Tenchi asked.

"Twenty minutes."

---

## SCENE 53
**Time:** 04:44:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

While the rice cooked, he addressed the other components.

Miso from the crock in the cold storage—the batch he'd prepared last autumn, fermented through winter, now reaching its peak flavor. Tofu from the village cooperative. Wakame seaweed that had been dried when his wife was still alive, preserved in tins that held memories as well as ingredients.

Simple food. Careful preparation. The same meal that had started his mornings for decades.

---

## SCENE 54
**Time:** 04:45:01 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"Can I help?"

Tenchi had asked the same question every morning for two years, since he'd grown large enough to be useful rather than merely present. The offer always carried the same earnest hope—to participate, to matter, to be included in the rhythms that shaped his grandfather's days.

"Set the table."

The task assigned, Tenchi moved with purpose.

---

## SCENE 55
**Time:** 04:45:18 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

He watched the boy work while his hands continued their own tasks.

Bowls from the cabinet. Chopsticks from the drawer. The arrangement that matched what they did every morning—grandfather's place facing the garden, Tenchi's place facing his grandfather, the positions that located them in relation to each other and to the space they shared.

The boy's movements carried increasing confidence. He was learning without being taught.

---

## SCENE 56
**Time:** 04:45:35 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The anomaly stirred again at the edge of his awareness.

Distant still. Not on the mountain yet. But moving, he thought—moving in this direction with something that felt like purpose rather than drift. Whatever was coming, it had orientation now. It knew where it was going.

He returned his attention to the miso. The soup wouldn't make itself.

---

## SCENE 57
**Time:** 04:45:52 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Dashi stock heated in the pot.

He'd made the base three days ago—kombu seaweed and bonito flakes, the traditional foundation that gave Japanese soup its particular depth. The liquid trembled at the edges, approaching the temperature where miso would dissolve without losing its living cultures.

Timing mattered. Timing always mattered.

---

## SCENE 58
**Time:** 04:46:09 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"Ojii-chan, why do you always smell the pot?"

The question came from behind him, where Tenchi had finished his assigned task and now observed with the relentless curiosity that characterized his waking hours.

"To know when it's ready."

"But you have a thermometer."

"Thermometers tell you numbers. Smell tells you truth."

---

## SCENE 59
**Time:** 04:46:26 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Tenchi processed this distinction with visible effort.

The boy lived in a world where numbers held authority—the numbers that told time on clocks, the numbers that measured things on rulers, the numbers that organized school days into periods and activities. The idea that truth might exist in forms numbers couldn't capture was new.

But he would learn. He had time.

---

## SCENE 60
**Time:** 04:46:43 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The miso went into the pot in measured spoonfuls.

He stirred with the worn wooden paddle that had served this purpose for longer than Tenchi had been alive, dissolving the fermented paste into the stock without over-agitating. The soup's color shifted from pale to the rich brown that meant morning and warmth and home.

Behind him, Tenchi sniffed experimentally.

---

## SCENE 61
**Time:** 04:47:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"I smell it changing," the boy announced.

"What do you smell?"

Tenchi's face scrunched with concentration. "Like... the garden when it's wet. And something that's not there anymore."

The description carried accidental poetry. The garden when it's wet—the earthiness of fermentation. Something that's not there anymore—the fish that had become the dashi's soul.

"Good," he said. "That's good."

---

## SCENE 62
**Time:** 04:47:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The tofu went in last.

Cubed and careful, settling into the soup without disturbing its achieved balance. The small squares floated briefly before finding their depths, white against brown, soft against liquid. The soup was complete.

He transferred it to the serving vessel, moving to the table where Tenchi had arranged everything in their proper positions.

---

## SCENE 63
**Time:** 04:47:34 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The rice cooker signaled completion.

The sound carried across the residence—a small beep that marked transition, announcing that one process had ended and another could begin. He retrieved the pot, steam rising as he removed the lid, the particular perfume of properly cooked rice filling the space.

"It smells like morning," Tenchi said.

---

## SCENE 64
**Time:** 04:47:51 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

They settled into their positions.

Tenchi's place setting showed the careful arrangement of a four-year-old trying to meet adult standards—not perfect, but earnest. The asymmetry had its own kind of precision, the precision of effort rather than achievement.

He said nothing about the placement. The corrections could come later.

"Itadakimasu," they said together.

---

## SCENE 65
**Time:** 04:48:08 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Breakfast proceeded in comfortable rhythm.

Rice lifted to mouth in small bites. Soup sipped directly from the bowl in the traditional manner. The pickled vegetables that provided contrast and crunch. Each element doing its work, contributing to the whole without demanding individual attention.

Tenchi ate with the particular focus of a growing child—fuel for the energy that would consume the day ahead.

---

## SCENE 66
**Time:** 04:48:25 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

"Ojii-chan?"

"Mm?"

"Will your visitor come while I'm at school?"

The question carried weight it probably hadn't intended. Tenchi had noticed his earlier comment, had held onto it through prayers and work and the distraction of breakfast preparation. The boy's mind retained information with concerning thoroughness.

"Perhaps. I'm not certain."

---

## SCENE 67
**Time:** 04:48:42 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Tenchi's face showed calculations happening beneath the surface.

"Will you tell me about them? When I get home?"

The request was reasonable. The child lived here, would encounter any visitor who stayed. Hiding information would only generate the anxiety that uncertainty bred in young minds—the imagination filling gaps with fears.

"I will tell you what I can."

---

## SCENE 68
**Time:** 04:48:59 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

"Promise?"

The word carried the particular gravity that children assigned to promises. A promise wasn't just an intention—it was a binding, a contract, a construction of trust that could be broken at terrible cost to the relationship that had built it.

"I promise."

Tenchi nodded, satisfied, and returned to his rice.

---

## SCENE 69
**Time:** 04:49:16 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The meal continued in silence for several minutes.

Outside, the morning had fully arrived. Light filled the garden, birds conducted their territorial negotiations, the temperature rose toward something approaching comfortable. The world did what worlds did, regardless of the small dramas unfolding within its boundaries.

He sensed Funaho's continued attention. The tree was still waiting, still watching.

---

## SCENE 70
**Time:** 04:49:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The anomaly had moved closer.

Not dramatically—not yet within range of specific identification. But the direction had clarified. South and east, somewhere in the flatlands below the mountain. Moving, he thought, though whether under its own power or carried by some vehicle he couldn't determine.

*Soon,* he thought toward Funaho. *We'll know soon.*

---

## SCENE 71
**Time:** 04:49:50 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

"May I be excused?"

Tenchi had finished eating, his bowls emptied with the efficiency of someone who understood food as fuel. The boy would need to change into his school uniform, collect his supplies, complete the small rituals that preceded departure.

"You may. Wash your hands before changing."

"Yes, Ojii-chan."

---

## SCENE 72
**Time:** 04:50:07 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

He watched Tenchi carry his dishes to the kitchen.

The boy moved with purpose now—the scattered energy of morning gathered into direction, focused on the tasks that led toward school. Small hands placed bowls in the basin. Small feet carried him toward the bathroom. Small voice hummed a melody he'd heard somewhere, probably television.

The routine of childhood, proceeding as it should.

---

## SCENE 73
**Time:** 04:50:24 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

He finished his own meal in the sudden quiet.

The residence felt different without Tenchi's presence—not empty, but stilled. The energy that radiated from the boy in constant waves had withdrawn to another part of the building, leaving behind the particular peace of a space no longer required to accommodate motion.

The tea in his cup had cooled. He drank it anyway.

---

## SCENE 74
**Time:** 04:50:41 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

His thoughts returned to the arriving presence.

The energy signature carried characteristics he recognized but couldn't quite place—not Juraian, not from any of the galactic civilizations he'd encountered during his time as prince. Something older, perhaps. Something that predated the empires he knew.

*What are you?* he wondered. *Where did you come from?*

---

## SCENE 75
**Time:** 04:50:58 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Funaho's response arrived as sensation rather than image.

Warmth. Welcome. The particular feeling of a plant turning toward favorable light. Whatever the tree sensed in the approaching presence, it registered as positive rather than threatening—something to be welcomed rather than defended against.

He trusted Funaho's judgment. The tree had protected this mountain longer than he'd lived on it.

---

## SCENE 76
**Time:** 04:51:15 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

Tenchi returned in his school uniform.

The sight never failed to affect him—the small body in formal clothing, the serious expression that tried to match adult dignity, the backpack that seemed too large for the shoulders that carried it. His grandson, preparing to face a world that didn't know what he was.

"Do I look okay?"

"You look ready."

---

## SCENE 77
**Time:** 04:51:32 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The distinction mattered.

"Okay" implied meeting external standards, satisfying the expectations of others. "Ready" implied internal preparation, being equipped for whatever might come. He wanted Tenchi to learn the difference—to understand that his own assessment of himself mattered more than others' approval.

The boy considered the word, then nodded.

"I'm ready."

---

## SCENE 78
**Time:** 04:51:49 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

They walked together to the entrance.

The genkan held the organized chaos of a household with a child—small shoes beside larger ones, umbrellas of varying sizes, the accumulated necessities of lives lived in Japanese convention. Tenchi sat on the raised floor to put on his outdoor shoes, a process that still required concentration.

"Remember to listen to your teacher."

"I always listen."

---

## SCENE 79
**Time:** 04:52:06 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

The statement wasn't entirely accurate, but he let it pass.

Tenchi listened when subjects interested him. Mathematics held his attention. Science generated questions. The stories in Japanese class sparked his imagination. The social rules—the protocols of interaction that school existed partly to teach—those he absorbed more slowly.

"And be kind to Takeshi-kun."

Tenchi's face showed reluctance. "He brought a snake."

---

## SCENE 80
**Time:** 04:52:23 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

"Bringing a snake isn't unkind. It's just... enthusiastic."

The incident had occurred last week. Tenchi had reported it with a mixture of admiration and irritation—admiration for the courage required, irritation that someone else had thought of it first. The snake itself had been harmless. The teacher's reaction had not.

"Maybe," Tenchi allowed. "But the teacher screamed."

"Teachers are allowed to scream sometimes."

---

## SCENE 81
**Time:** 04:52:40 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, entrance

Shoes secured, backpack adjusted, Tenchi stood ready.

The boy barely reached his chest when they stood together—a reminder of how much growing remained, how many years would pass before Tenchi reached anything like adult height. Time moved differently for children. A school day was an eternity. A summer lasted forever.

"Be safe."

"Always."

---

## SCENE 82
**Time:** 04:52:57 JST  
**Location:** Outside shrine residence

They emerged into full morning light.

The walk to the bus stop took fifteen minutes down the mountain path—a distance Tenchi had traveled alone since last spring, when he'd insisted he was old enough to manage. The independence mattered to the boy. The worry it generated in his grandfather was carefully concealed.

"I'll be home at the usual time."

---

## SCENE 83
**Time:** 04:53:14 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, path beginning

The shrine grounds stretched peaceful in the morning sun.

Cherry blossoms drifted occasionally, released by breeze too gentle to feel. The main hall stood solid and patient. Beyond it, barely visible through the forest, Funaho's crown swayed in wind that didn't reach ground level.

Tenchi headed toward the path without looking back.

---

## SCENE 84
**Time:** 04:53:31 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, watching Tenchi

He watched until the boy's form disappeared around the first bend.

The path would carry Tenchi through forest, down the mountain, to the road where the school bus stopped. The route was safe—he'd walked it countless times himself, verified every step, evaluated every potential hazard. But safety was relative when your grandson walked alone.

*Watch him,* he thought toward Funaho. *Like you always do.*

---

## SCENE 85
**Time:** 04:53:48 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, watching path

Warmth answered him. Acknowledgment. The tree's awareness extended throughout the mountain, perceiving through roots and resonance what eyes couldn't see. Tenchi was never truly alone when Funaho watched.

The boy didn't know this. He wouldn't understand if told. But the protection existed regardless of awareness.

He turned back toward the residence.

---

## SCENE 86
**Time:** 04:54:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, returning

The morning's remaining tasks awaited.

Dishes to wash. Rooms to tidy. The shrine grounds to inspect for anything visitors might notice. The thousand small maintenance tasks that kept a sacred space presentable and a household functional. Work that filled time, that gave structure, that prevented the kind of waiting that eroded patience.

He began with the dishes.

---

## SCENE 87
**Time:** 04:54:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Water ran hot over the morning's bowls.

The simple mechanical motion of washing freed his mind for the considerations it wanted to pursue—the approaching presence, its nature, its purpose. Seven hundred years had taught him that unexpected arrivals rarely brought simple answers. Something was coming. Something would change.

He scrubbed rice residue from the cooker pot.

---

## SCENE 88
**Time:** 04:54:39 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The energy signature had clarified further.

Not threatening—he'd become increasingly certain of that. But powerful. More powerful than anything he'd sensed since arriving on this planet. Whatever was coming carried weight, density, the accumulated presence of something significant. A seed falling into prepared soil, Funaho had shown him.

But whose seed? To grow what?

---

## SCENE 89
**Time:** 04:54:56 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

He finished the dishes and dried them with the care he gave to all things.

Each bowl returned to its shelf. Each utensil to its drawer. The kitchen restored to the state that allowed the next meal's preparation to begin without first clearing the last meal's debris. Order maintained. Systems preserved.

The residence waited quietly around him.

---

## SCENE 90
**Time:** 04:55:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The futons needed airing.

He collected them from both bedrooms—his and Tenchi's—and carried them to the engawa where morning sun would warm them. The ritual served practical purpose—moisture released, dust dispelled—but also satisfied something deeper. Care manifested through action. Love expressed through maintenance.

Tenchi's futon smelled like the boy himself. Small and alive.

---

## SCENE 91
**Time:** 04:55:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

He beat the futons with the traditional bamboo paddle.

The rhythm had its own meditation—lift, strike, rotate, repeat. Dust rose in clouds that the breeze carried away. The fabric released tension it had accumulated overnight, relaxing into shapes that would cradle bodies again when darkness returned.

His arms didn't tire. His true form didn't tire of such things.

---

## SCENE 92
**Time:** 04:55:47 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Between strikes, he monitored the approaching presence.

Closer now. Definitely closer. Moving with purpose along routes he could almost predict—the roads that led to this mountain, the paths that terminated at this shrine. Whoever was coming, they knew where they were going.

Or something was guiding them.

---

## SCENE 93
**Time:** 04:56:04 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds

He left the futons to sun and walked the shrine perimeter.

The morning inspection followed a pattern established over centuries—check the main hall, verify the auxiliary buildings, examine the paths for debris or damage, ensure the purification fountain flowed clear. Each step confirmed that the shrine remained as it should.

The cherry blossoms needed sweeping. He collected the broom.

---

## SCENE 94
**Time:** 04:56:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main path

The broom moved in long strokes across the stone.

Pink petals gathered in small drifts, their beauty yielding to the practical need for clear walkways. The blossoms had served their purpose—attracted attention, signaled spring, reminded visitors that time moved regardless of human concerns. Now they could be composted.

The pile grew as he worked his way toward the torii gate.

---

## SCENE 95
**Time:** 04:56:38 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near torii

The gate stood solid against the morning light.

He paused beneath it, looking down the steps that descended the mountain in their numbered procession. Three hundred and twenty. Each one placed with intention, each one worn smooth by generations of climbing feet. The path that connected this sacred space to the ordinary world below.

Somewhere down there, the presence moved closer.

---

## SCENE 96
**Time:** 04:56:55 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near torii

He could almost feel the moment it touched the mountain.

Not physically—the distance was still too great. But the energy registered differently once it entered the territory Funaho's roots defined. The mountain knew. The tree knew. Whatever was coming had entered their awareness fully.

*Can you see them?* he asked.

Funaho's answer came as color: silver against the green of the world.

---

## SCENE 97
**Time:** 04:57:12 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near torii

Silver.

The color carried meaning he couldn't quite parse. Not the silver of metal or age. Something else. A quality rather than a hue. The particular brightness that appeared in things touched by forces beyond ordinary understanding.

He'd seen silver like that only once before. In the light of Jurai's royal ships.

---

## SCENE 98
**Time:** 04:57:29 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, returning to path

He resumed sweeping, his mind continuing to work.

The approaching presence carried cosmic weight—that much was certain. But cosmic didn't necessarily mean Juraian. The universe held powers older than any empire, forces that predated the civilizations he knew. Some of them slept. Some of them watched. Some of them occasionally intervened.

The broom gathered petals. The thoughts gathered possibilities.

---

## SCENE 99
**Time:** 04:57:46 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main path

The pile of petals had grown substantial.

He transferred them to the composting area—a corner of the grounds where organic matter returned to soil, where the cycle of growth and decay played out in miniature. The blossoms would become earth. The earth would feed next year's blossoms.

The universe worked in circles. Even the cosmic ones.

---

## SCENE 100
**Time:** 04:58:03 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, composting area

He stood for a moment among the quiet processes of decay.

The morning had progressed into full daylight. Tenchi would be on the bus by now, heading toward a school day that held the ordinary dramas of childhood—lessons and friends and teachers who screamed at snakes. The boy's world remained intact.

But something was coming that might expand that world considerably.

He returned the broom to its place and prepared to wait.
