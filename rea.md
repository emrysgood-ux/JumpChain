## Origin: The Mystery of Geminar

### What Is Geminar?
Geminar is an alternate dimension connected to the Tenchi Muyo multiverse. It features:
- Medieval-esque technology mixed with bio-mechanical constructs
- Isolated from main universe
- Rare crossings between dimensions

### How Rea Arrived
**CANON:** Kiyone Masaki discovered infant Rea in a field approximately 1984 — before or shortly after Tenchi's birth.

The circumstances:
- No explanation for how a Geminar infant appeared on Earth
- Dimensional rift? Deliberate placement? Unknown
- Kiyone chose NOT to investigate deeply
- She simply took the child in

*📝 Rea's origin remains one of the story's unsolved mysteries.*

---

## Personality

**As Child (1989):**
- Quiet, observant
- Helpful beyond her years
- Attached to household
- Somewhat serious for a child
- Protective of Tenchi

**Core Traits (Developing):**
- Practical competence
- Emotional reserve
- Deep loyalty to family
- Awareness of being "different" without understanding why

---

## Role in the Household

After Kiyone's death (~1987), Rea stepped into a caretaking role:
- Learned cooking from Kiyone, now prepares meals
- Helps maintain the household
- Looks after young Tenchi
- Functions as older sister despite uncertain age

### The Burden
At approximately 5 years old, Rea performs duties expected of someone much older:
- Not forced, but self-imposed
- Filling void left by Kiyone's death
- Nobuyuki and Yosho allow it (perhaps shouldn't)
- She finds purpose in being needed

*📝 Rea's competence at such a young age hints at Geminar heritage — or trauma response.*

## Family Connections

| Relation | Person | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Adopted Mother | Kiyone Masaki | Deceased; found and raised Rea |
| Adopted Brother | Tenchi Masaki | Grew up together |
| Adopted Father | Nobuyuki Masaki | Technically; relationship unclear |
| Adopted Grandfather | Yosho/Katsuhito | Watches over her |

---

## What She Knows

**Rea is aware:**
- She was found, not born to this family
- Kiyone never lied to her about this
- Her origins are mysterious

**Rea does NOT know:**
- She's from another dimension
- "Geminar" as a concept
- Why she was found in that field
- Her true heritage

---

## Relationship with Tenchi

Rea and Tenchi grew up together from infancy:
- She's protective of him (despite being same age or younger)
- He thinks of her as his sister
- Their bond predates his memories of Kiyone
- She carries memories of Kiyone that he doesn't

### The Caretaker Dynamic
Rea often acts as Tenchi's older sibling:
- Reminds him of chores
- Bandages his scrapes
- Warns him about dangers
- Occupies the "responsible one" role

---

## Phase I Integration

**What Sheldon Will See:**
- A quiet, competent child
- Unusually mature for her age
- Devoted to household duties
- Close to Tenchi

**What Sheldon Can Learn:**
- Kiyone found her as a baby
- She's adopted/found family
- Her origins are unknown

**What Sheldon CANNOT Learn (Phase I):**
- Geminar as dimensional origin
- Any cosmic significance
- Connection to larger Tenchi multiverse

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **Phase I (1989):** Rea is present from Day 1. Sheldon encounters her as part of the household — a quiet girl who helps with cooking and watches over Tenchi.

🔮 **SHELDON'S REACTION:** Sheldon, himself placed by cosmic forces, may sense kinship with another "found" child. Their parallel situations create thematic resonance.

📖 **DYNAMIC:** Rea and Sheldon may clash or cooperate over household duties. She's used to being the competent one; his arrival disrupts that.

📖 **MYSTERY:** Rea's origins remain unresolved. The story may never explain exactly how a Geminar child appeared on Earth — or it may become plot-relevant later.

---

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Rea is NOT a servant — she chooses to help, nobody forces her
- Her competence is NOT normal — 5-year-olds don't usually cook and clean
- She is NOT blood-related to the Masaki family
- Her Geminar origin is CANON but unexplained in main timeline

**Connection to War on Geminar:**
The "Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar" spin-off features Kenshi Masaki going to Geminar. Rea represents the reverse — someone from Geminar coming to Earth.
