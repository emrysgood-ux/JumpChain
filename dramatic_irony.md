## PURPOSE

## PHASE I DRAMATIC IRONY STRUCTURE

During Phase I (Years 1-3), the dramatic irony operates on multiple levels:

**Level 1 — Universe Identity:**
- Reader knows: Tenchi Muyo universe
- Sheldon thinks: Generic rural Japan

**Level 2 — Personal Identity:**
- Reader knows: Cosmos reincarnated
- Sheldon thinks: Amnesiac with unusual skills

**Level 3 — Family Secrets:**
- Reader knows: Alien royalty, sealed entities
- Sheldon sees: Eccentric elderly priest, mysterious cave

**Level 4 — Ability Source:**
- Reader knows: Lambda Power manifestation
- Sheldon feels: "Just naturally good at this"

---

## IRONY MAINTENANCE RULES

### NEVER Reveal Prematurely:
1. Sheldon cannot think forbidden words
2. Sheldon cannot consciously perceive supernatural elements
3. Sheldon cannot deduce cosmic truths from evidence
4. Reader hints must be SUBTLE — body language, environment, NOT internal monologue

### Acceptable Tension-Building:
1. Sheldon notices oddities but rationalizes them
2. Reader sees what Sheldon misses
3. Near-misses (almost discovering truth)
4. Other characters' knowing looks (from their POV only)

## REVELATION SCHEDULE

| Phase | What Reader Learns | What Sheldon Learns |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Phase I (Years 1-3) | Deepening family bonds | Normal life skills |
| Phase II (Years 4-12) | Ability awakening signs | "Maybe I'm special" |
| Phase III (Year 13+) | Full cosmic integration | Universe truth |
