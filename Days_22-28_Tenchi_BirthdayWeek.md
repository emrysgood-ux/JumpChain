# DAY 22 - APRIL 24, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **BIRTHDAY! TENCHI IS FIVE!**

---

## MORNING (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-030 | Waking Up Five**
Five!

Tenchi woke up and held up his hand. All five fingers. That was him now. Five whole years old.

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"

Everyone was in the doorway. Grandpa, Papa, Sheldon-san. They were all smiling.

Tenchi laughed and laughed.

---

**SCENE 031-060 | Birthday Breakfast**
Sheldon-san made pancakes. Not regular pancakes—they had a face made of fruit. Banana smile, strawberry eyes, blueberry nose.

"It's ME!"

"Happy birthday, Tenchi."

"Can I eat my face?"

Everyone laughed. Tenchi ate his face and it was delicious.

---

**SCENE 061-100 | Presents!**
No school today because birthday.

Presents were wrapped in pretty paper. Tenchi ripped them open.

From Papa: A new backpack with robots on it. Blue robots!

From Grandpa: A wooden puzzle box with animals carved on it. "It was made by someone who cares about you." Grandpa looked at Sheldon-san.

Sheldon-san made the box? Tenchi held it tight.

"Thank you thank you thank you!"

---

From Sheldon-san: A small tanuki carved from wood. It fit perfectly in his hand.

"He'll protect you."

"What's his name?"

"That's for you to decide."

Tenchi looked at the tanuki's round belly and mischievous face.

"Maru. Because he's round."

"Maru it is."

---

## AFTERNOON (Scenes 101-200)

**SCENE 101-150 | Birthday Games**
They played games in the shrine yard. Tag. Hide and seek. Tenchi won at hiding because he was small enough to fit in places grown-ups couldn't check.

Papa laughed. Really laughed. Tenchi couldn't remember when Papa laughed that hard.

---

**SCENE 151-200 | Cake**
Cake! It was chocolate with white frosting and five candles.

"Make a wish!"

Tenchi closed his eyes. He wished... he wished...

That everything could stay like this forever.

Then he blew. All five candles went out.

Everyone clapped.

---

## EVENING (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-250 | Best Day**
Birthday dinner was Tenchi's favorites. Omurice and karaage and rice and miso soup.

"This is the best day."

"Better than any other day?" Papa asked.

"This day has EVERYONE."

The grown-ups looked at each other. Tenchi didn't know why that was special, but it felt like he'd said something important again.

---

**SCENE 251-299 | Sleeping as Five**
Maru the tanuki sat on Tenchi's pillow. The puzzle box was next to his futon. The robot backpack was ready for tomorrow.

Five years old.

The wish was already coming true. Everyone was still here.

Tenchi slept.

---

# DAY 23 - APRIL 25, 1989 (TUESDAY)

Papa had to go back to Kurashiki tomorrow. But today he was still here.

They walked the mountain paths together. Just Tenchi and Papa.

"Do you like living here?"

"Yes!"

"Even with your grandfather being so... traditional?"

Tenchi didn't know that word. "Grandpa is Grandpa."

Papa smiled. "That he is."

---

"Do you like Sheldon-san?"

"He makes good food and he's nice and he has star-eyes."

"Star-eyes?"

"Little silver sparkles. Like the sky."

Papa was quiet. Then: "You're very observant."

Tenchi didn't know that word either. But it sounded good.

---

# DAY 24 - APRIL 26, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)

**Papa Leaves**

The car went down the mountain. Tenchi waved until it disappeared.

"Will he come back?"

"Of course," Grandpa said.

"When?"

"When his work allows."

Work was something that kept Papa away. Tenchi didn't like work.

---

Sheldon-san was there when Tenchi stopped waving.

"Want to help me in the garden?"

"Okay."

Gardening helped. Doing something helped. Sheldon-san knew when doing something was needed.

---

# DAY 25 - APRIL 27, 1989 (THURSDAY)

Back to school with the new robot backpack. Everyone wanted to see it.

"Where did you get it?"

"My papa gave it to me for my birthday!"

"Lucky!"

Tenchi felt lucky. He had Papa and Grandpa and Sheldon-san and Maru the tanuki.

---

# DAY 26 - APRIL 28, 1989 (FRIDAY)

Sheldon-san was looking at papers with Grandpa. Boring grown-up stuff.

"What are those?"

"Plans for fixing the old house."

"Can I see?"

They showed him. Lines and squares and numbers.

"It's a puzzle."

"That's exactly what it is," Sheldon-san said.

---

# DAY 27 - APRIL 29, 1989 (SATURDAY)

A new man came. Nishida-san. He walked all over the sad house with Sheldon-san and Grandpa.

"This will take time," he said.

"How much time?"

"A year. Maybe two."

Two years was forever. But Sheldon-san nodded like that was okay.

"We'll do it right."

---

# DAY 28 - APRIL 30, 1989 (SUNDAY)

The last day of April.

Sheldon-san had been here for almost a whole month.

"Will you be here for May?"

"I'll be here."

"June?"

"Yes."

"July August September October November December?"

The man laughed. "Yes to all of those."

Tenchi grinned. A whole year of months. That was a lot of good food and star-eyes and help.

"Good."
