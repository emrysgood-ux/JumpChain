**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Shrine residence → Tsukino House (work site) → Village (supply run) → Shrine residence  
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 19°C high, 11°C low, light afternoon breeze  
**Sunrise:** 5:34 AM | **Sunset:** 6:36 PM

## SCENE 1: SECOND SUNDAY
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Two weeks.

The realization arrived with morning light filtering through shoji screens that had become familiar. Fourteen days since waking in a chrysanthemum field with no memory of arrival. Fourteen days of learning a life that shouldn't be his but increasingly felt like it might become so.

The guest room showed more signs of habitation than it had a week ago. The notebook had gained companions: a pencil, a small dictionary, construction notes from Yamada's explanations. The photograph of his grandmother had been joined by the one Uncle Kiyoshi sent—two women from the same family, decades apart, both looking at cameras with expressions that suggested patience and stubbornness in equal measure.

He dressed without hurrying. Sunday meant no kindergarten for Tenchi, which meant the boy would likely appear at breakfast with plans that required adult participation. The pattern had established itself: children's days off became opportunities for supervised exploration, for questions that adults couldn't always answer, for the slow accumulation of shared experiences that built toward something neither party had explicitly named.

---

## SCENE 2: SUNDAY BREAKFAST
**Time:** 07:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Katsuhito had already started cooking.

The priest moved through his kitchen with the economy of someone who had performed these tasks ten thousand times—rice measured by feel rather than cup, vegetables cut with strokes that wasted nothing, the choreography of meal preparation reduced to its essential motions.

"You're earlier than usual," Sheldon observed.

"Sunday visitors. The shrine receives more attention when workers have time to pay it." Katsuhito didn't look up from his cutting. "People bring offerings, ask for blessings, remember that the mountain holds more than trees."

"Should I make myself scarce?"

"Should you?" The question reflected back, as Katsuhito's questions often did. "You're a resident now, temporary or otherwise. Residents don't make themselves scarce in their own home."

The framing carried implications Sheldon wasn't sure he'd earned. Nine days of sleeping under this roof didn't constitute residence in any legal sense. But Katsuhito operated by frameworks older than legal categories—belonging measured in different currencies than occupancy.

"I could help with the preparations."

"You could. The vegetables need washing."

---

## SCENE 3: TENCHI'S MORNING
**Time:** 07:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

The boy arrived with energy that belied the early hour.

"Grandfather, can we go to the waterfall today?"

Katsuhito's expression suggested this request was neither new nor unexpected. "The waterfall is a four-hour round trip. Do you have four hours of walking in you?"

"Yes." Tenchi's confidence was immediate. "I walked all day yesterday and I wasn't tired."

"You walked within the property. The mountain trail is different."

"I can do it." The insistence carried the particular certainty of children who hadn't yet learned the limitations of their own bodies.

Sheldon watched the negotiation unfold, recognizing patterns from his own childhood—the push for independence, the adult calibration of what was actually possible, the compromise that usually satisfied neither party completely.

"Perhaps," Katsuhito said, "when you're five."

"That's only eight more days."

"Then you have eight days to wait."

---

## SCENE 4: SUNDAY VISITORS
**Time:** 09:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main approach

The first visitors arrived while Sheldon was helping stack ceremonial supplies.

An elderly couple from the village—he recognized them vaguely from his walks, faces seen but not yet connected to names. They climbed the steps with the measured pace of people who had made this journey hundreds of times, their bodies knowing exactly how much effort each step required.

Katsuhito met them at the torii gate, his priestly robes a transformation from the practical clothes he wore for household tasks. The greeting followed forms Sheldon couldn't follow—formal language, ritualized exchanges, the compressed communication of people who shared a lifetime of context.

The visitors glanced at Sheldon with curiosity that politeness prevented from becoming stares. The new resident. The inheritor of Etsuko's house. The stranger who had appeared without warning and integrated himself into the mountain's rhythms.

He bowed—the general-purpose bow Katsuhito had taught him, appropriate for most social situations—and received nods in return. Acknowledgment without judgment. The village's assessment remained ongoing.

---

## SCENE 5: OBSERVATION
**Time:** 10:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, secondary structure

From a distance, Sheldon watched Katsuhito perform his duties.

The priest moved through ritual with precision that suggested deep familiarity—gestures that had been practiced until they required no thought, words pronounced with exactly the right intonation, the choreography of sacred space maintained through bodies that remembered what minds might forget.

The visitors stood in appropriate positions, their postures suggesting their own long familiarity with these forms. They had been coming to this shrine for decades, perhaps generations. The rituals connected them to ancestors who had stood in the same places, made the same requests, received the same blessings.

Sheldon's grandmother had been one of these people once. Before America, before marriage, before the ocean crossing that had separated her from this mountain. She had climbed these steps, made these offerings, received blessings from priests whose line led eventually to Katsuhito.

The continuity stretched across time in ways that made his own insertion into the timeline feel less arbitrary. He wasn't a disruption. He was a return.

---

## SCENE 6: CONSTRUCTION ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 11:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Yamada worked even on Sundays.

"The wood doesn't know what day it is," the carpenter explained when Sheldon arrived. "Treatment continues regardless of calendar."

The house showed two weeks of progress. The northeast roof section had been fully stripped, damaged members replaced, new wood treated and fitted into place. The east side followed a similar trajectory, perhaps two-thirds complete. Tarps covered sections awaiting attention, blue polyethylene standing guard against weather that had mostly cooperated.

"How much longer?"

"For the structural work? Three more weeks, if conditions hold." Yamada wiped his hands on a cloth that had seen better days. "Then tile replacement. Then finishing. Call it five weeks total from today."

The timeline had stretched from the original estimate, but not unreasonably. Hidden damage required hidden repairs. The house had needed more than anyone had known.

"The foundation?"

"Stable, for now. I've consulted with Tanaka—he recommends monitoring rather than immediate intervention. If the settling continues after the roof is secure, we'll address it then. If not, the stone supports have found their new position and will hold."

---

## SCENE 7: VILLAGE SUPPLY RUN
**Time:** 13:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Village commercial district

Tenchi insisted on accompanying the supply run.

"Grandfather said I could go if Sheldon-san supervises." The boy had negotiated his own permission, apparently, leveraging the day's earlier disappointment about the waterfall into a smaller concession.

They walked down the mountain together, the path now familiar enough that Sheldon's feet found their own way. Tenchi pointed out landmarks with the proprietary knowledge of childhood—the tree where a tanuki had been spotted last summer, the rock that looked like a sleeping bear, the bend where the path split toward the lower village.

The village center—such as it was—consisted of perhaps twenty buildings clustered around a single intersection. A general store. A sake shop. A small restaurant that served lunch to workers from the surrounding farms. A post office that probably handled mail for the entire mountain.

"What do we need?" Tenchi asked, assuming his role as assistant.

"Rice. Vegetables. Fish if they have it fresh."

"Takeda-san usually has fish on Sundays. His son goes to the river early."

The local knowledge children carried—who had what, when things were available, the rhythms of commerce in a community small enough to know everyone's habits.

---

## SCENE 8: THE GENERAL STORE
**Time:** 13:25:00 JST  
**Location:** Village general store

Nakamura-san ran the store with the efficiency of someone who had been doing it for forty years.

"Tsukino-san." The greeting came without surprise—word traveled fast in small communities. "And young Masaki. What brings you down the mountain?"

"Weekly supplies." Sheldon consulted the mental list Katsuhito had provided. "Rice, daikon, cabbage, onions. Miso if you have a good batch."

"The Yamamoto miso just arrived. Better than last month's." She began gathering items with the confidence of someone who knew her inventory by heart. "I heard about your house. Bad luck about the termites."

"Better to find them now than after the roof failed."

"True enough. Etsuko-san was always too stubborn to ask for help until things went past fixing. At least you're letting Yamada do it properly."

The observation carried the weight of village history Sheldon was still learning. Etsuko's reputation—proud, stubborn, self-sufficient to a fault—emerged in fragments from conversations like this one. The woman who had maintained a house alone for decades, refusing assistance until the assistance became mandatory.

"She did her best with what she had."

"She did. And now you'll do better, with what she left you."

---

## SCENE 9: TENCHI'S DETOUR
**Time:** 14:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Village, small shrine

The boy pulled him toward a structure Sheldon hadn't noticed before.

A small shrine—miniature compared to Katsuhito's domain—stood at the edge of the village center. Weathered wood, simple construction, the accumulated maintenance of generations who had kept it standing through indifference and devotion alike.

"This is where the village kami lives," Tenchi explained with the authority of someone sharing essential knowledge. "Grandfather says every village has one. They protect the people who live there."

"Different from the mountain shrine?"

"Different domain." The word came out carefully, practiced. "Grandfather's shrine serves the mountain. This one serves the village. They're... related, but not the same."

The theology of local spirits, explained by a four-year-old with the confidence of someone who had grown up inside a worldview rather than learning it from outside. Tenchi didn't question the existence of kami because the question had never occurred to him. They simply were, like trees and rivers and the old man who maintained their house.

"Do you come here often?"

"Sometimes. When we visit the village. Grandfather always pays respects, so I do too."

Tenchi approached the small offering box, produced a five-yen coin from his pocket—prepared for this moment, apparently—and deposited it with the careful attention of ritual properly observed.

---

## SCENE 10: THE WALK HOME
**Time:** 15:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Mountain path, ascending

The supplies made the climb heavier but not unmanageable.

Sheldon carried most of the weight, but Tenchi insisted on transporting a small bag of his own—vegetables light enough for small arms, contribution made material through shared burden. They walked in companionable silence, the rhythm of ascent requiring breath that conversation would steal.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Yes?"

"When your house is fixed, will you still eat dinner with us?"

The question contained implications beyond its surface. Would the repair create distance? Would separate residence mean separate lives? The concerns of a child processing changes he couldn't fully control.

"That depends on your grandfather. But I'd like to, if I'm welcome."

"You're welcome." The statement carried certainty children possessed before they learned to doubt. "Grandfather likes you. I can tell."

"How can you tell?"

"He teaches you things. He only teaches people he likes."

The observation landed with surprising weight. Katsuhito's willingness to explain, to correct, to guide—these had felt like hospitality. Tenchi's interpretation suggested something more deliberate.

---

## SCENE 11: EVENING RHYTHM
**Time:** 18:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Dinner preparation had become collaborative.

Sheldon washed, Katsuhito cut, Tenchi set the table with the careful attention he brought to tasks he considered important. The kitchen moved around them—water running, knives working, the quiet efficiency of people who had learned to share space without colliding.

"The village shrine," Sheldon said. "Tenchi showed it to me."

"Ah." Katsuhito's knife didn't pause. "The Inari shrine. Older than this one, in some ways. The village existed before the mountain shrine was established."

"He said they're related but not the same."

"He listens well." A slight smile. "The mountain shrine serves larger purposes—the kami of this peak, the spirits that predate the village. The village shrine serves daily needs. Protection of crops, blessing of children, the small requests of ordinary lives."

"And your responsibilities extend to both?"

"Formally, no. Practically, yes. The village priest retired years ago and no one has replaced him. I perform the essential rites when asked. It's not ideal, but—" He shrugged. "The kami understand constraints."

---

## SCENE 12: NIGHT CONVERSATION
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

Stars again. The mountain's darkness made them visible in ways urban life had hidden.

"Two weeks," Katsuhito said, echoing Sheldon's morning observation without having heard it. "How do you find your new life?"

"Strange. Becoming less strange. I'm not sure which concerns me more."

"Why would decreasing strangeness concern you?"

"Because it might mean I'm forgetting what normal used to be. Or accepting what shouldn't be acceptable."

Katsuhito considered this. Tea cooled in cups neither had touched for several minutes. The evening had turned cool but not cold—spring settling into its middle phase, neither the chill of early April nor the warmth of approaching May.

"You assume there's something unacceptable about your presence here."

"I appeared out of nowhere with a fabricated history. That's definitionally abnormal."

"Fabricated by whom?"

The question stopped Sheldon's response before it formed. He had assumed fabrication—documents created, memories implanted, a past constructed by whatever force had placed him here. But the assumption contained implications he hadn't examined.

"I don't know."

"Then how do you know it was fabricated? Perhaps—" Katsuhito's voice carried the careful neutrality of someone offering a possibility rather than asserting a truth. "Perhaps it was discovered. Or recovered. Or was always true, waiting for you to arrive and inhabit it."

---

## SCENE 13: BEFORE SLEEP
**Time:** 21:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The futon accepted him with familiar give.

Fourteen days. Two weeks of a life that might be fabricated, discovered, or something else entirely. The categories blurred when examined closely—what was any life but a story told after the fact, shaped by memory and interpretation?

His grandmother had lived in this village. That was documented, verifiable, confirmed by photographs and letters and the memories of people still living. His mother had been born here, had left, had married an American, had raised a son who became the person lying in this room.

The insertion point was strange. Everything else—the family, the history, the house, the connections—those were real. They had existed before him and would continue after him. He had simply been... added. Like a new thread woven into existing fabric, finding its place in a pattern already established.

The presence at sleep's edge felt closer tonight. Not intrusive—never intrusive—but present in ways that suggested attention.

*Rest now*, something offered. *Tomorrow continues the work.*

He slept.
