# Grounding Son of Cosmos in 1989 Rural Okayama

The **320 steps to Tarojinja Shrine are real**—this detail from your story matches the actual shrine exactly. Located in Asaguchi City's Kamitake district, this small hillside shrine dedicated to the goddess of revelry became an unlikely anime pilgrimage site after inspiring Masaki Shrine in Tenchi Muyo. What follows is a comprehensive reference for authentic period details, from the exact timing of bath rituals to the specific vegetables harvested in early April.

## Tarojinja Shrine stands exactly as described

The shrine sits at GPS coordinates 34.559°N, 133.626°E in Okayama Prefecture, about 22 minutes by car from Kamogata Interchange. Visitors face **approximately 320 stone steps** spanning 300 meters of steep ascent—the latter half becomes particularly challenging. Stone torii gates with Edo-period inscriptions mark the path, alongside weathered komainu guardian statues and moss-covered lanterns.

The haiden (worship hall) measures **5 ken by 3 ken** (roughly 9m × 5.4m), featuring distinctive hip-and-gable irimoya-zukuri architecture with elegant dragon and eagle carvings in the entrance canopy. The honden (main sanctuary) is constructed entirely of zelkova wood in the rare single-bay Hiyoshi style, topped with green-patinated copper roofing.

The enshrined deity is **Ame-no-Uzume-no-Mikoto**, goddess of dawn, mirth, and performing arts—she who danced so provocatively that Amaterasu emerged from hiding to restore light to the world. A secondary deity, Kunado-no-kami, protects travelers and crossroads. This combination makes the shrine associated with *yakuyoke* (warding off misfortune), safe childbirth, and success in artistic endeavors.

Critically for your story: **Tarojinja has no resident priest**. Chief Priest Kuwano (77 years old as of 2016) manages it alongside other shrines. This means realistic depictions might show the shrine grounds quiet during ordinary hours, with ceremonial activities occurring only during scheduled festivals or when visitors request formal prayers.

## April in Okayama brings changeable weather and cherry blossoms

Early April temperatures swing dramatically: **highs around 17°C, lows near 8°C**. Characters would dress in layers—sweaters during the day, light jackets for evening. The 10°C temperature differential means mornings feel genuinely cold while afternoons turn pleasantly warm. Cherry blossoms typically reach peak bloom around April 3rd, with petals falling by mid-month.

Okayama earns its nickname "The Sunny Country" (*Hare no Kuni*) through relatively low rainfall, though April still brings approximately 92mm across 15 rainy days. Humidity sits at 60%—the year's lowest. Sunrise occurs around 5:50 AM, sunset at 6:25 PM, giving farmers roughly 13 hours of daylight.

The atmospheric details matter: morning mist rising from rice paddies that haven't yet been flooded, cherry petals drifting onto stone shrine steps, the particular quality of spring light filtering through cedar forests. By late April, farmers begin "awakening the fields" (*ta okoshi*), and the countryside shifts from winter dormancy to planting preparation.

## Village life runs on sirens and seasonal rhythms

Rural Okayama villages of this era typically held **1,500-5,000 residents**, though mountain settlements could be smaller. Population skewed elderly—the average farmer was 51 years old, twelve years older than industrial workers. Two-thirds of households farmed part-time, combining agriculture with factory or office work. Young people had largely migrated to cities for education and employment.

Three sirens structured daily village life:
- **6:00 AM**: Wake-up signal
- **12:00 PM**: Lunch break from fields
- **5:00 PM**: End of workday

Community bonds remained strong through shared duties: public cleaning several times yearly, rotating festival management between families, radio announcements about weather warnings and local news. The **irori** (sunken hearth) served as the traditional gathering point in farmhouses—the beating heart of family and village life where cooking, eating, warming, and gossip all converged.

The **JA agricultural cooperative** functioned as village hub. Every farmer belonged. JA provided banking, insurance, gas stations, fertilizer, pesticides, machinery sales, and rice marketing. The local JA branch was effectively a community center where farmers gathered, conducted business, and shared information.

## ¥3,400 bought a substantial amount in 1989

The consumption tax was brand-new (introduced April 1, 1989, at 3%), and Japan's asset bubble had reached its peak. Rural prices ran 5-10% lower than Tokyo.

**What ¥3,400 could purchase at a rural shop:**
- A **5kg bag of rice** (¥2,500-3,000—rice was expensive due to government price controls)
- Approximately **five or six meals** at a local restaurant
- A week's basic groceries for one person (¥4,000-5,000 total)

Individual item prices (1989 estimates): bowl of ramen ¥400-600, basic *teishoku* set meal ¥500-700, tofu block ¥50-80, fresh fish ¥200-400, ten eggs ¥150-200, miso paste ¥200-300. A gyudon beef bowl cost roughly ¥300-400. Train fare from rural stations to Okayama City ran ¥500-800 for medium distances.

## Phones were landlines, heat came from kerosene

By 1989, rural homes had **individual landlines** (party lines were eliminated in Japan by the late 1980s). Standard rotary or push-button phones sat on small tables in hallways. Public green phones dotted bus stops and train stations—local calls cost ¥10 per minute. Phone cards in ¥500 and ¥1,000 denominations could be purchased at vending machines. Remote mountain shrines **likely lacked phone service**; residents would travel to nearby villages to make calls.

Heating deserves particular attention for atmosphere:

**Kerosene heaters** (*sekiyu stove*) dominated—81% of households used kerosene as primary heat. The distinctive smell pervaded winter homes. Portable units required refilling from 18-liter tanks purchased at gas stations for ¥800-1,200. You could heat a kettle or warm food on the top surface. Important detail: kerosene heaters required periodic ventilation, meaning windows opened briefly even in cold weather.

**Kotatsu** (heated tables with quilted covers) served as family gathering points. By the late 1980s, electric kotatsu had replaced charcoal versions in most homes. Families ate, watched television, did homework, and even slept around the kotatsu. Traditional homes **lacked central heating and good insulation**—unheated hallways and bathrooms were genuinely cold. You could see your breath in winter in rooms without heaters.

Television reception in mountain areas was poor with standard antennas. NHK's satellite service (begun 1987) specifically targeted remote regions, but many rural families still dealt with fuzzy reception.

## The shrine residence follows strict spatial hierarchy

A shrine priest's residence (*shamusho* or adjacent quarters) follows traditional Japanese house layout with clear boundaries between public and private space:

**Public/ceremonial spaces:**
- **Genkan** (entryway): 20-40cm step up where shoes are removed
- **Zashiki** (formal guest room): 6-8 tatami mats with tokonoma alcove displaying seasonal scroll and flower arrangement

**Semi-private:**
- **Hiroma** (main living room): 8-10 tatami mats, possibly with irori hearth

**Private:**
- **Nando** (bedrooms)
- Kitchen area with traditional kamado stove
- **Engawa** (wooden veranda) connecting rooms to garden

A **kamidana** (home altar) sits in a prominent position. The priest offers fresh rice, salt, and water daily. Fusuma (sliding paper doors) separate rooms; shoji screens filter light from the engawa. Futon bedding stored in oshiire closets during daytime, laid directly on tatami at night.

## Meals and bathing follow precise schedules

**Meal timing:**
- Breakfast: **6:30-7:30 AM**
- Lunch: **12:00-2:00 PM**
- Dinner: **6:00-7:30 PM**

Traditional breakfast follows *ichiju sansai* (one soup, three dishes): steamed rice, miso soup with tofu and wakame, grilled fish (often mackerel), rolled omelet, pickled vegetables, perhaps natto. Green tea throughout. The rice cooker would be set the night before with a timer; miso soup made fresh each morning.

**Critical dietary restriction**: Shrine priests traditionally avoided animal meat, especially before rituals. Blood-shedding was considered impure. Before festivals, priests abstained from meat for 1-3 days minimum. Daily offerings to kami included rice, sake, salt, water, vegetables, and fish—but **never animal meat**.

**Bathing customs** provide rich scene-setting opportunities:

Evening bathing occurs **7:00-10:00 PM**, after dinner but before bed. The purpose is relaxation and washing away the day's fatigue—not primarily hygiene. Water temperature runs **40-41°C** (hot by Western standards).

**Bathing order follows strict hierarchy:**
1. Guests (offered first bath as honor)
2. Grandfather
3. Father
4. Sons
5. Grandmother
6. Mother
7. Daughters

Crucially: **everyone uses the same bathwater**. Bathers wash completely outside the tub (seated on a small stool, using bucket or shower), rinse thoroughly, then enter the tub to soak. Water stays clean because no one washes in it. Between bathers, a lid keeps water warm—**15-30 minutes between each person**. The same water often gets recycled for laundry the next day.

By 1989, most homes had gas-heated systems, though some remote mountain houses retained wood-fired baths. A guest would be offered yukata (cotton robe) after bathing.

## April shrine activities center on spring festivals and planting prayers

The **Haru Matsuri** (Spring Festival) runs late March through April, when priests conduct *Toshigoi-no-Matsuri*—prayers for successful rice planting and harvest. Full priestly dress is required: white *jōe* robe, black *eboshi* hat, formal *hakama*. Ceremonies involve purification (*harae*), food offerings, *norito* prayers, and sometimes *kagura* sacred dance.

**A priest's April daily rhythm:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:30-6:30 | Wake, morning purification, sweep grounds |
| ~7:00 | Morning offering ceremony to kami |
| 6:30-7:30 | Breakfast |
| 8:00-17:00 | Receive visitors, administrative duties, festival preparation |
| ~17:00 | Evening offering ceremony |
| 18:00-19:30 | Dinner |
| 19:00-21:30 | Bath (guest first, then family) |
| 22:00-23:00 | Bedtime |

Cherry blossom season brings increased visitors for hanami viewing. The 1st and 15th of each month are traditional visiting days with higher foot traffic. Parents bring children for prayers at school entrance season.

## Okayama-ben gives characters distinctive speech

The Okayama dialect belongs to the Chūgoku group, related to but distinct from Kansai-ben. The accent sits closer to standard Japanese than strong Kansai intonation, but certain features mark speakers immediately:

**Most distinctive:** The sentence-ending particles **けん (ken)** or **けぇ (kee)** meaning "because"—locals describe this as sounding "wild but pretty."

**Key grammatical differences:**

| Feature | Okayama-ben | Standard Japanese |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Copula ("is/are") | **じゃ (ja)** | だ (da) |
| "Because" | **けん (ken)** | から (kara) |
| Progressive action | **-よる (-yoru)** | -ている (-te iru) |
| Completed action | **-とる (-toru)** | -ている (-te iru) |

Examples: "太郎は勉強**しよる**" (Tarō is studying—ongoing) versus "太郎は勉強**しとる**" (Tarō has studied—completed). "そう**じゃ**" instead of "そうだ" for "That's right." "行く**けん**" instead of "行くから" for "because I'm going."

Elderly villagers would use stronger dialectal forms; younger speakers mixed dialect with standard Japanese absorbed through television.

## Rice farming in April means seedbed work, not planting

This timing matters for authenticity: **transplanting occurs in late April to mid-May**, not early April. In early April, farmers are:

- Selecting heavy rice grains for nursery trays
- Sowing seeds in greenhouse trays (JA often handled this by the 1980s)
- Beginning *ta okoshi* ("awakening the fields")—the first plowing as cherry blossoms fall

Paddies get **flooded in late April**, just before transplanting. The actual *taue* (transplanting) typically aligns with Golden Week (late April-early May)—the holiday period was intentionally created to give farmers transplanting time.

**Okayama's signature rice varieties:**
- **Asahi**: Native variety, ancestor of Koshihikari, valued for refreshing sweetness and quality when cold (sushi chefs prize it). Tall, difficult to cultivate, harvests late (November-December).
- **Omachi**: Premium sake-brewing rice, native to Okayama since 1859. Extremely tall (120-150cm), challenging to grow.

The region is called "The Fruit Kingdom" for its famous **Hakuto white peaches** (harvested July-August) and Muscat grapes (September-October). In April, peach farmers thin buds to concentrate nutrients; grape farmers prune vines.

## Farmers drive kei trucks and wake before dawn

The ubiquitous **kei truck** (軽トラ) defined rural transportation. In 1989, regulations limited engines to 550cc (changed to 660cc in March 1990).

**Popular 1989 models:**
- **Suzuki Carry** (8th generation): Round headlights, F5A 543cc engine, most common overall
- **Daihatsu Hijet**: "Jumbo Cab" option offered extra legroom, available supercharged
- **Honda Acty**: Mid-engine "NSX of the farm" with "Attack" version featuring differential lock for paddy fields
- **Subaru Sambar**: Rear-engine layout, excellent traction

All featured 4WD options, 5-speed manual transmissions, 350kg bed capacity, and 40+ mpg efficiency. Farmers loaded them with tools, seedlings, and harvested crops. A new kei truck cost approximately ¥600,000-900,000.

**Farmer schedules:**
- Wake: **4:30-5:00 AM** year-round
- Start fieldwork: **5:00-6:00 AM** (especially summer, before heat)
- Lunch: **12:00 PM**
- Finish: **4:00-6:00 PM** depending on season
- Bedtime: **9:00 PM**

The traditional **yui** (結) mutual-aid system persisted, though mechanization reduced its necessity. Neighbors still gathered for rice planting, exchanging labor rather than money. Women called *saotome* had central roles; traditional *taue-uta* songs accompanied the work. By 1989, one person with a transplanter could complete in an hour what once took days of cooperative labor—but social bonds remained.

## Concrete details for scene-building

**Sensory palette:** Kerosene heater smell, steam rising from outdoor baths, clatter of kei truck engines, sliding wooden doors, cold drafts in unheated hallways, green phone chirping when accepting coins, distant train echoes through mountain valleys.

**Visual markers:** Telephone poles with tangled black wires crossing the sky, terraced rice paddies (not yet flooded in early April), stone shrine steps with moss in the cracks, cherry petals on gravel paths, blue-gray smoke from kerosene vents, elderly farmers in practical work clothes.

**Time anchors:** 6 AM village siren, 12 PM lunch siren, 5 PM end-of-work siren, 6:30 AM Radio Taiso exercise broadcast, evening bath steam rising between 7-9 PM.

The 320 stone steps to Tarojinja are real. The goddess of revelry waits at the top. And in April 1989, the cherry blossoms would have been falling as farmers awakened their fields and shrine priests offered morning rice to the kami.
