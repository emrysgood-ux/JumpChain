## The Mihoshi Paradox

Mihoshi appears to be a ditzy, clumsy, incompetent officer. This is BOTH true and misleading:

**Surface Level:**
- Forgetful
- Clumsy
- Easily confused
- Falls asleep at inappropriate times
- Causes collateral damage

**Hidden Truth:**
- Unnaturally lucky (possibly reality-bending)
- Stumbles into correct solutions
- Subconsciously brilliant tactical mind
- Washu suspects something anomalous about her luck patterns

*📝 Mihoshi's "incompetence" consistently produces better outcomes than planned competence.*

## Family Connections

| Relation | Person | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Great-Great-Grandmother | Washu | Secret lineage through Kuramitsu family |
| Relation to Ryoko | Distant cousin | Through Washu connection |
| Grandfather | Minami Kuramitsu | Grand Marshal of Galaxy Police |
| Brother | Misao Kuramitsu | GP officer, overprotective |

*📝 The Washu connection means Mihoshi has latent abilities she doesn't understand.*
