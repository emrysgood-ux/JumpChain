## Washu's Investigation (Year 13+)

Within moments of release, Washu's sensors detect Sheldon's anomalous energy signature.

- Energy type: UNKNOWN (not Juraian, not Masu, not standard cosmic)
- Pattern: Extremely ordered, almost mathematical
- Comparison: Nothing in 20,000-year database matches

**Chousin Conference Result:**
- WASHU: "Someone else has been playing in our sandbox."
- TSUNAMI: "I sense... kinship? But not from us."
- TOKIMI: "This is outside our experiment parameters."

**Verdict:** Sheldon classified as "Protected Anomaly" — observe but do not interfere
- WASHU: "I claim first investigation rights. This could take centuries."
