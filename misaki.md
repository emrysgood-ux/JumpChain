**CANON NOTE:** In OVA 3, there's a complex plot element where a "Counter-Actor" entity somehow merges with Misaki. This is advanced canon that occurs well after our story's timeframe.

## 4. STORY RELEVANCE (Pre-Canon Period)

### 4.1 — 1989 Status

- Active as Second Queen on Jurai
- Daughters (Ayeka/Sasami) are with her
- Does NOT know about Tenchi
- Grieving Yosho's absence in her own way

### 4.2 — Story Integration

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon's POV (Phase I):**
- Misaki
- Queens of Jurai
- Juraian royal family details

**When She Becomes Relevant:**
- Only after Year 13+ events
- Would visit with daughters
- Would notice and investigate Sheldon
- Would likely adopt him into "family"

## 5. CANON NOTES

### 5.1 — The OVA 3 Complexity

The Counter-Actor subplot involving Misaki is complex OVA 3 material. For our story purposes:
- This occurs AFTER Year 13
- Sheldon would learn about it later
- It doesn't affect pre-canon characterization

### 5.2 — Common Errors to Avoid

| Error | Correct Information |
|-------|-------------------|
| Misaki is just a gentle queen | She's a FIERCE warrior AND gentle mother |
| Misaki is weak | She's one of Jurai's best fighters |
| Misaki is politically naive | She inherited Seto's strategic mind |
