- "My hands just... know"

- "Something I picked up" (vague)

### About Katsuhito
- "The old priest"

## PHASE TRANSITIONS

### Day 366 (After Full Revelation)
Sheldon MAY now think:
- Cosmos (her name)
- Lambda (his power source)
- JumpChain (the framework)
- Perks (his abilities)

Sheldon still CANNOT think:
- Tenchi-universe terms he hasn't learned on-page
- Character names he hasn't heard spoken

### Year 13 (Canon Events Begin)
As characters arrive and are NAMED ON-PAGE:
- Ryoko → permitted after she's named
- Ayeka → permitted after she's named
- Etc.

```

```
