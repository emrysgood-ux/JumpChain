# CANONICAL SOURCE: SAILOR COSMOS & LAMBDA POWER

## Overview

This document catalogs all known powers and abilities associated with Sailor Cosmos, the Cosmos Crystal, and Lambda Power from the Sailor Moon manga (Stars arc). This serves as the canonical foundation for developing Sheldon's non-JumpChain power progression.

**Critical Distinction:** This document covers powers derived from Sheldon's nature as Cosmos's son and bearer of a Cosmos Seed. The Martial Development Track covers JumpChain grants and trained abilities. These two systems interact but are sourced differently.

---

## 1.2 The Cosmos Crystal (Cosmos Seed)

### Nature

The Cosmos Crystal is:
- The Sailor Crystal of the Galaxy Cauldron itself
- Protected by Guardian Cosmos
- The source of Lambda Power
- An octahedron shape, silver with circular rainbow aura
- Eventually becomes Sailor Cosmos's personal Sailor Crystal

### Core Properties

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Ultimate Regenerative Power** | When awakened, releases Lambda Power capable of recreating/rebirthing an entire galaxy's worth of Sailor Crystals |
| **Universal Scale** | Power operates at cosmological level; references the Cosmological Constant (Λ) |
| **Static Creation** | Can create a "static universe" — opposing entropy, maintaining eternal stability |
| **Sailor Crystal Hierarchy** | Highest tier in the crystal hierarchy: above Silver Crystal, Pink Moon Crystal, Golden Crystal |

### Relationship to Other Crystals

| Crystal | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| **Silver Crystal** | Protects Moon Kingdom → Cosmos Crystal protects entire galaxy |
| **Golden Crystal** | Protects Earth → Cosmos Crystal protects all celestial bodies |
| **Sailor Crystals** | Individual → Cosmos Crystal is source/apex of all |

---

## 1.3 Lambda Power — Detailed Analysis

### Etymology & Meaning

**Lambda (Λ)** — The eleventh letter of the Greek alphabet. In cosmology, Λ represents the **Cosmological Constant** — a term Einstein added to his General Theory of Relativity to create a force opposing gravity, theoretically maintaining a static, eternal universe.

### Thematic Significance

Lambda Power represents:
- **Rebirth over destruction** — The power to restore rather than annihilate
- **Order over chaos** — The antithesis of Chaos's entropy
- **Static eternity** — Opposing universal heat death
- **Healing as cosmic force** — Not passive, but actively reordering reality

### Canonical Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Scale |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Universal Restoration** | Restored reality from Chaos's corruption | Cosmological |
| **Multi-Dimensional Repair** | Fixed damage across multiple dimensions including Sailor Pluto's underworld | Multi-dimensional |
| **Mass Revival** | Revived all Sailor Senshi killed in Galaxia war; sent them to rebirth | Galaxy-wide |
| **Cauldron Purification** | Purified the Galaxy Cauldron from Chaos contamination | Creation-source |
| **Existence Preservation** | Allowed Senshi to survive in Galaxy Cauldron in civilian forms | Conceptual |

### How Lambda Power Activates

Per manga: Lambda Power awakens when all of the galaxy's Sailor Crystals are combined into one power and focused through the Cosmos Crystal. Usagi achieved this by gathering the power of all Sailor Crystals in herself.

---

## 1.4 Guardian Cosmos

### Nature

Guardian Cosmos is:
- The guardian of the Cosmos Crystal in the Galaxy Cauldron
- A few inches tall; wears sheer beaded dress; carries glowing staff
- Possibly the Sailor Power Guardian of Sailor Cosmos
- May have existed since universe creation
- Connected to Queen Serenity and Princess Serenity's birth

### Powers/Role

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cosmos Crystal Protection** | Guards the Cosmos Seed within the Cauldron |
| **Sailor Crystal Selection** | Decides which Star Seeds become Sailor Crystals |
| **Rebirth Authority** | Can grant rebirth or restoration to those in the Cauldron |
| **Wisdom Bestowal** | Lambda Power users gain "wisdom of the universe" |
| **Creation Oversight** | Oversees the Galaxy Cauldron's function |

---

# PART 2: SHELDON'S COSMOS SEED — THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

## 2.1 What Is Sheldon's "Cosmos Seed"?

Sheldon does not possess the Cosmos Crystal itself. That crystal belongs to the Galaxy Cauldron and eventually to Sailor Cosmos.

Instead, Cosmos has created something new: a **derivative Cosmos Seed** — a nascent crystal structure patterned after the original, implanted in Sheldon when she remade him as her son.

### Key Properties

| Property | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **Derivative, not original** | Not the Galaxy Cauldron's crystal; a created copy/offspring |
| **Nascent/immature** | Starts dormant; matures over centuries |
| **Tied to Sheldon's existence** | Functions as his "Star Seed" equivalent |
| **Lambda-potential** | Contains the seed of Lambda Power; not immediately accessible |
| **Growth-oriented** | Designed to develop with him, not grant instant power |

### What This Means for Power Progression

Sheldon's powers don't start at Cosmos-tier. They start at **seed-tier** — potential without expression — and mature through:
1. Time (centuries of natural growth)
2. Emotional development (love, bonds, family)
3. Crisis activation (threats triggering dormant capabilities)
4. Cosmos's intervention (she can accelerate/unlock as needed)
5. Training and cultivation (conscious development)

---

## 2.2 Power Categories

Sheldon's Cosmos-derived powers fall into categories based on manifestation timing:

### Passive/Inherent (Present from Day 1)
Powers that are "always on" — part of his remade nature.

### Reactive (Crisis-Triggered)
Powers that activate automatically in response to threat or need.

### Developmental (Mature Over Time)
Powers that require growth, training, or time to manifest.

### Unlockable (Cosmos's Choice)
Powers Cosmos can activate when she judges he's ready or needs them.

### Ultimate (Millennium-Scale)
Powers that require centuries of maturation to access.

---

# PART 3: POWER PROGRESSION BY ERA

## 3.1 Phase I: Dormant Seed (Years 1-12)

### What's Active

**Passive/Inherent:**
| Power | Effect | Observable As |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Perfected Vessel** | Body maintained at physical prime; won't degrade | "Good health" |
| **Longevity Anchor** | Aging halted at prime; won't die of old age | Unnoticeable yet |
| **Disease Immunity** | Star Seed-level resilience to illness | "Never gets sick" |
| **Recovery Enhancement** | Heals faster than normal humans | "Good constitution" |
| **Cosmic Resilience** | Resistant to reality-warping, mind control baseline | Unnoticeable |

**Reactive:**
| Power | Trigger | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Danger Sense** | Threat to self or loved ones | Gut feeling; unease |
| **Protective Instinct** | Family in danger | Knows something's wrong |

### What's Dormant

- Lambda Power (completely sealed)
- Energy projection
- Conscious barrier creation
- Temporal abilities
- Long-range detection
- All offensive capabilities

### Observable Behavior

Sheldon appears to be a healthy, lucky human with excellent instincts. Nothing overtly supernatural. The village might notice he never gets sick and injuries heal quickly, but attributes this to "strong body" or "good fortune."

---

## 3.2 Phase II: Awakening (Years 13-50)

**Trigger:** Ryoko's release; Kagato crisis; household chaos

### New Activations

**Reactive (Crisis-Triggered):**
| Power | Trigger | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Lambda Surge** | Life-threatening danger to family | Burst of enhanced physical capability |
| **Healing Touch (Minor)** | Loved one injured | Accelerates their healing through contact |
| **Barrier Instinct** | Direct attack incoming | Unconscious partial barrier (weak) |
| **Threat Detection** | Hostile presence nearby | Knows direction and rough magnitude |

**Developmental (Beginning to Manifest):**
| Power | Effect | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Energy Sensing** | Can feel power levels and intent | Confusing at first; clarifies over time |
| **Lambda Core Awareness** | Knows the seed exists inside him | Feels warmth/presence during meditation |
| **Emotional Resonance** | Family bonds strengthen his powers | More capable when protecting loved ones |

### What Remains Dormant

- Conscious Lambda projection
- Temporal abilities
- Long-range powers
- Reality manipulation
- Full barrier generation
- Cosmic-scale capabilities

### Observable Behavior

Sheldon is noticeably more capable than a normal human. He can hold his own in supernatural situations. His family starts to realize he's "special" but can't quantify how. He himself doesn't understand his powers — they manifest without his control.

---

## 3.3 Phase III: Development (Years 50-200)

**Context:** Established in cosmic community; married to Yosho; raising children

### New Activations

**Developmental (Maturing):**
| Power | Effect | Control Level |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Lambda Projection** | Can consciously project healing/restorative energy | Basic |
| **Barrier Generation** | Can create protective barriers deliberately | Moderate |
| **Energy Channeling** | Can channel Lambda through objects/weapons | Basic |
| **Recovery Sharing** | Can extend his healing to others directly | Moderate |
| **Long-Range Sensing** | Can detect disturbances at planetary scale | Basic |

**Unlockable (Cosmos activates):**
| Power | Effect | Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Crisis Amplification** | Temporarily accesses higher power tier | Extreme danger |
| **Lambda Shield** | Full-strength protective barrier | First time family nearly dies |
| **Restoration Burst** | Mass-healing of multiple people | Major battle aftermath |

### What Remains Dormant

- Temporal abilities
- Reality manipulation
- Universal-scale powers
- Direct Lambda Power (full expression)
- Cosmos Crystal synchronization

### Observable Behavior

Sheldon is now unambiguously superhuman. He can protect his family from most threats. He's learning to control abilities that previously manifested randomly. He's still nowhere near Cosmos-tier, but he's a genuine player in supernatural conflicts.

---

## 3.4 Phase IV: Mastery (Years 200-500)

**Context:** Elder of extended family; centuries of experience; significant cosmic involvement

### New Activations

**Developmental (Mastered):**
| Power | Effect | Control Level |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Lambda Projection** | Full healing/restoration projection | Mastered |
| **Barrier Generation** | Can create barriers at city-block scale | Mastered |
| **Energy Channeling** | Lambda flows through all actions | Integrated |
| **Dimensional Stability** | Resistant to dimensional manipulation | High |
| **Long-Range Detection** | Can sense disturbances across solar system | High |

**Unlockable (Cosmos activates):**
| Power | Effect | Timing |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Temporal Resistance** | Cannot be erased from timeline | Year ~300 |
| **Lambda Domain** | Creates area of accelerated healing/protection | Year ~400 |
| **Cosmic Communication** | Can reach Cosmos across dimensional barriers | Year ~500 |

### What Remains Dormant

- Full Lambda Power expression
- Universal-scale restoration
- Time manipulation (active)
- Reality restructuring
- Cosmos Crystal full synchronization

### Observable Behavior

Sheldon is among the most powerful beings in the local region. He can affect outcomes at planetary scale. He's a known quantity in cosmic politics — people factor him into their calculations. He's still not Cosmos-tier, but he's comparable to high-tier Tenchi Muyo characters.

---

## 3.5 Phase V: Transcendence (Years 500-1000)

**Context:** Ancient; approaching cosmic tier; existential questions; legacy-building

### New Activations

**Ultimate (Millennium-Scale):**
| Power | Effect | Year Accessed |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Lambda Power (Full)** | Can access the restoration/rebirth aspect of Lambda | ~600 |
| **Dimensional Travel** | Can move between dimensions through will | ~700 |
| **Cosmic Awareness** | Senses disturbances across the galaxy | ~800 |
| **Reality Anchoring** | Can stabilize reality in his presence | ~900 |
| **Cosmos Synchronization** | Full connection to his mother's power | ~1000 |

**Theoretical Ceiling:**
| Power | Effect | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Universal Restoration** | Could restore damage at universal scale | Requires full Lambda |
| **Static Field** | Could create a zone of eternal stability | Cosmos-tier power |
| **Mass Revival** | Could theoretically revive the dead | Would require Cosmos's direct involvement |

### Observable Behavior

Sheldon is now genuinely cosmic-tier. He's not Sailor Cosmos — he's her son, with derivative rather than original power — but he operates at a scale that would have been inconceivable to his younger self. He's lived a millennium. He's protected his family through generations. He's earned this.

# PART 4: DETAILED POWER DESCRIPTIONS

## 4.1 Core Lambda Abilities

### Lambda Healing

**What It Is:** The signature power of Lambda — restoration, not destruction.

**How It Works:**
- Projects golden-silver energy that restores targets to their "true" state
- Heals physical wounds, cures disease, removes corruption
- Can purify negative energy/corruption
- Does not work through force — the subject must accept the healing or be unable to resist

**Progression:**
| Era | Capability |
|-----|------------|
| Year 1-12 | Dormant |
| Year 13-50 | Unconscious; healing touch accelerates others' natural recovery |
| Year 50-200 | Conscious; can actively heal injuries through focused effort |
| Year 200-500 | Mastered; can heal multiple people simultaneously |
| Year 500-1000 | Transcendent; can heal at conceptual level (restore what was lost) |

**Limitations:**
- Cannot resurrect the dead (only Cosmos herself can do this)
- Cannot heal what the subject doesn't want healed
- Cannot undo time (restoration is to "true state," not "previous state")
- Draining at higher levels; requires rest after major use

### Lambda Barrier

**What It Is:** Protective barriers generated from Lambda energy.

**How It Works:**
- Creates a field that repels/absorbs incoming attacks
- Stronger against negative/chaotic energy than physical force
- Can be projected around self or others
- Scales with emotional investment in what's being protected

**Progression:**
| Era | Capability |
|-----|------------|
| Year 1-12 | Dormant |
| Year 13-50 | Reactive; unconscious partial barriers in crisis |
| Year 50-200 | Conscious; can create barriers deliberately |
| Year 200-500 | Mastered; city-block scale; indefinite duration |
| Year 500-1000 | Transcendent; planetary scale possible; conceptual protection |

**Limitations:**
- Physical attacks partially penetrate (better against energy)
- Draining to maintain large barriers
- Emotional state affects strength (fear weakens, love strengthens)
- Cannot protect against everything simultaneously

### Lambda Projection

**What It Is:** Direct projection of Lambda energy for various purposes.

**Applications:**
- Energy blasts (rare — Lambda prefers restoration over destruction)
- Weapon enhancement (channeling through sword/staff)
- Environmental purification (cleansing corrupted areas)
- Power boosting (temporarily enhancing allies)

**Progression:**
| Era | Capability |
|-----|------------|
| Year 1-12 | Dormant |
| Year 13-50 | Reactive; uncontrolled bursts in crisis |
| Year 50-200 | Conscious; basic projection and channeling |
| Year 200-500 | Mastered; precise control; multiple applications |
| Year 500-1000 | Transcendent; cosmic-scale projection possible |

---

## 4.2 Sensory Abilities

### Energy Sensing

**What It Is:** The ability to detect power levels, intent, and supernatural presences.

**How It Works:**
- Perceives energy signatures as a "sixth sense"
- Can estimate power levels (rough, not precise)
- Detects hostile intent before action
- Recognizes familiar energy signatures (family, friends, known threats)

**Progression:**
| Era | Range | Precision |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Year 1-12 | Immediate area | Vague feelings |
| Year 13-50 | Local (kilometers) | Direction and magnitude |
| Year 50-200 | Planetary | Signature recognition |
| Year 200-500 | Solar system | Detailed analysis |
| Year 500-1000 | Galactic | Cosmic awareness |

### Protective Awareness

**What It Is:** Specific awareness of threats to loved ones.

**How It Works:**
- Knows when family members are in danger
- Feels direction/distance to endangered person
- Urgency scales with severity of threat
- Can distinguish between danger types (physical, spiritual, emotional)

**Note:** This power is always active once established. Sheldon will always know when his family is threatened, regardless of distance or barriers.

---

## 4.3 Defensive Abilities

### Cosmic Resilience

**What It Is:** Inherent resistance to supernatural effects.

**Protects Against:**
- Mind control and mental intrusion
- Reality warping and timeline manipulation
- Dimensional displacement
- Corruption and negative energy contamination
- Existence erasure (at higher levels)

**Progression:**
| Era | Resistance Level |
|-----|------------------|
| Year 1-12 | Baseline (resistant to casual attempts) |
| Year 13-50 | Moderate (difficult to affect; requires effort) |
| Year 50-200 | High (only strong beings can affect him) |
| Year 200-500 | Very High (mostly immune to indirect effects) |
| Year 500-1000 | Near-Absolute (can only be affected by cosmic-tier beings directly) |

### Regeneration

**What It Is:** The ability to recover from injury.

**How It Works:**
- Heals from wounds faster than normal
- Can regenerate from severe damage given time
- Resistant to permanent injury
- At higher levels, can survive normally-fatal damage

**Progression:**
| Era | Recovery Rate |
|-----|---------------|
| Year 1-12 | 3x normal human |
| Year 13-50 | 10x normal; can survive critical wounds |
| Year 50-200 | Near-instantaneous for minor wounds; hours for major |
| Year 200-500 | Minutes for major wounds; can regrow limbs |
| Year 500-1000 | Conceptual regeneration; survives existence-level damage |

---

## 4.4 Advanced Abilities (Late Development)

### Temporal Resistance

**Unlocks:** ~Year 300

**What It Is:** Protection against timeline manipulation.

**Effects:**
- Cannot be erased from history
- Remembers across timeline changes
- Resistant to temporal attacks
- Maintains existence even if "past self" is attacked

### Lambda Domain

**Unlocks:** ~Year 400

**What It Is:** Creates an area of Lambda influence.

**Effects:**
- Within domain, healing is accelerated for all
- Negative energy is suppressed
- Allies receive defensive boost
- Sheldon is significantly stronger inside his domain

**Range:** Starts at household scale; grows to city-block by Year 600

### Cosmic Communication

**Unlocks:** ~Year 500

**What It Is:** The ability to reach Cosmos across dimensions.

**Effects:**
- Can call to his mother even across dimensional barriers
- Receives guidance/information from Cosmos
- In extreme crisis, Cosmos may respond directly

**Limitation:** One-way communication mostly; Cosmos responds when she chooses.

---

# PART 5: POWER INTERACTIONS

## 5.1 Lambda + JumpChain Grants

Sheldon has two power sources: his inherent Cosmos Seed and his JumpChain grants. These interact.

### Synergies

| Lambda Power | JumpChain Grant | Combined Effect |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lambda Healing | Accelerated Recovery | Healing compounds; near-instant recovery |
| Lambda Barrier | Mountain's Heart | Barriers become nearly immovable |
| Energy Sensing | Danger Sense | Comprehensive threat awareness |
| Protective Awareness | Guardian's Art | Absolute protection of loved ones |
| Cosmic Resilience | All defensive grants | Stacked resistances |

### Priority

When Lambda powers and JumpChain grants could both apply, Lambda takes precedence — it's the more fundamental power. JumpChain grants enhance and specialize; Lambda provides the foundation.

---

## 5.2 Lambda + Emotional State

Lambda Power is heavily influenced by Sheldon's emotional state.

### Enhancers

| Emotion | Effect on Lambda |
|---------|------------------|
| Love | Significantly stronger; protective powers amplified |
| Determination | More focused; better control |
| Hope | Healing powers enhanced |
| Peace | Barriers more stable; domain effects stronger |

### Inhibitors

| Emotion | Effect on Lambda |
|---------|------------------|
| Fear | Powers weaken; barriers become permeable |
| Despair | Healing powers diminish |
| Rage | Control suffers; power becomes wild |
| Isolation | All powers weakened; Lambda responds to connection |

### Implication

Sheldon's power is directly tied to his family bonds. He's strongest when protecting people he loves. He's weakest when alone or emotionally disconnected. This is a feature, not a bug — Cosmos designed it this way.

---

## 5.3 Lambda + Tenchi Muyo Power Systems

How Lambda interacts with the native powers of the Tenchi universe:

### Juraian Power (Light Hawk Wings, Royal Trees)

- Lambda and Juraian power are compatible
- Both derive from cosmic-tier sources
- Sheldon can be boosted by Juraian techniques
- His children (with Yosho) may manifest hybrid abilities

### Ryoko/Washu Power

- Lambda can heal Ryoko's gem-based injuries
- Washu's technology can analyze but not replicate Lambda
- Lambda barriers can contain Ryoko's energy attacks
- No fundamental conflict between systems

### Chousin Power

- Lambda is below Chousin-tier
- Cosmos operates at similar level to Chousin
- Sheldon's Lambda Seed is derivative; not directly comparable
- The Chousin would recognize Lambda as significant but not threatening

---

# PART 6: NARRATIVE APPLICATIONS

## 6.1 When Lambda Powers Matter

### Daily Life

- Healing Touch: Sheldon can help injured family members recover faster
- Protective Awareness: He always knows when something's wrong
- Recovery Enhancement: He bounces back from illness/injury quickly

### Combat Situations

- Lambda Barrier: Protects family during attacks
- Energy Sensing: Knows when enemies are coming
- Lambda Surge: Can match supernatural threats temporarily

### Crisis Events

- Full Lambda Access: In dire situations, accesses higher power tiers
- Restoration: Can heal major damage after battles
- Cosmic Communication: Can call for Cosmos's help (rarely)

## 6.2 When Lambda Powers Don't Matter

### Canon Events

- Tenchi is still the protagonist
- Lambda powers don't solve Kagato/Ryoko/etc. — they help survive them
- Sheldon supports rather than supplants canonical solutions

### Character Conflicts

- Lambda can't heal emotional wounds
- Powers don't prevent arguments, misunderstandings, relationship struggles
- Being strong doesn't make him wise (that comes from experience)

### Everyday Problems

- Lambda doesn't help with cooking (well, maybe a little)
- Can't use cosmic power to fix a leaky roof
- Being Cosmos's son doesn't make bureaucracy easier

## 6.3 The Core Limitation

**Lambda Power is restoration, not creation.**

Sheldon can heal what's broken. He can protect what exists. He can restore what was lost.

He cannot:
- Create new life (only Cosmos/Galaxy Cauldron can do this)
- Resurrect the truly dead (above his tier)
- Undo choices or rewrite history
- Force outcomes through power alone

His mother gave him the power to protect and heal because that's who he is. She didn't make him a god — she made him a guardian.

| Year 13-50 | Reactive surges, healing touch, weak barriers | Low Superhuman |
| Year 50-200 | Conscious projection, solid barriers, planetary sensing | High Superhuman |
| Year 200-500 | Mastered Lambda, temporal resistance, domain creation | Planetary |
| Year 500-1000 | Full Lambda access, cosmic awareness, reality anchoring | Cosmic |

## 7.2 Comparison to Canon Characters

| Character | Sheldon Match Point | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Tenchi (full power) | Never | Tenchi is special; different category |
| Yosho (prime) | Year ~200 | Different strengths; complementary |
| Ryoko | Year ~100-150 | Comparable; different styles |
| Ayeka | Year ~50 | Exceeds in direct power; she has other strengths |
| Washu | Never | Different domains entirely |
| Kagato | Year ~100 (if alive) | Could have matched |
| Z | Year ~500 | Uncertain; Z is anomalous |
| Chousin | Never directly | Lambda is derivative of Cosmos-tier, not Chousin-tier |

## 7.3 Mother-Son Power Comparison

| Ability | Sailor Cosmos | Sheldon (Peak) |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Lambda Power | Original; full access | Derivative; significant but not complete |
| Universal Restoration | Can restore universe | Can restore region/planet |
| Time Travel | Full control | Resistance only; no active travel |
| Cosmos Crystal | Wielder | Bearer of Seed (derivative) |
| Immortality | Type 1, 3, 4, 8 | Type 1, 3 (lesser); no resurrection |
| Reality Manipulation | Full access | Anchoring/stability only |

# APPENDIX B: DESIGN NOTES

## Why This Framework?

Sheldon needs powers that:
1. **Scale with the setting** — Tenchi Muyo has cosmic-tier threats
2. **Grow over time** — A millennium allows gradual development
3. **Match his character** — Protective, restorative, not destructive
4. **Support the narrative** — Enables family protection without overshadowing canon
5. **Derive from established lore** — Sailor Moon provides rich canonical foundation

## What Cosmos Wants

Cosmos isn't trying to make Sheldon into another Sailor Guardian. She's giving her son the tools to:
- Survive in a dangerous universe
- Protect the family he builds
- Grow into his own power over time
- Eventually connect with her on something like equal terms

She gave him Lambda — the power of healing and restoration — because that reflects who he is and what she hopes for him.
