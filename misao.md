## The Overprotective Brother

- Views her as fragile (she isn't)

## Galaxy Police Career

### Achievements
- Commanded the Choubimaru (massive battleship)
- Rose to significant rank
- Generally competent leadership

### Failures
- Let obsession with Mihoshi cloud judgment
- Attempted to destroy Earth to "save" Mihoshi (GXP arc)
- Nearly caused interstellar incident
- Required intervention to stop

---

## The Earth Incident (GXP Era)

**CANON:** Misao became convinced that Mihoshi was being held against her will on Earth. His response:
1. Mobilized the Choubimaru
2. Planned to destroy Earth if necessary
3. Was stopped by combination of forces
4. Survived only due to family connections

This incident demonstrates:
- The danger of his obsession
- His fundamental inability to understand Mihoshi is HAPPY
- The power of Kuramitsu family to shield failures

---

## Relationship with Mihoshi

**What Misao Believes:**
- Mihoshi is helpless and needs protection
- Everyone around her is a threat
- She would be safer away from Earth
- He knows what's best for her

**The Reality:**
- Mihoshi is genuinely content
- Her "luck" protects her better than he ever could
- His interference causes more problems
- She loves him but wishes he'd relax

---

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon POV:**
- The name "Misao"
- Any reference to Mihoshi having a brother
- Any reference to Kuramitsu family drama

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **GXP ERA:** Misao's attempted attack on Earth may become relevant if GXP events are integrated. The household would need to deal with a battleship aimed at their planet.

🔮 **THEMATIC FUNCTION:** Misao represents protective love gone wrong. His arc warns against trying to control those we love "for their own good."

📖 **CONTRAST WITH SHELDON:** Both are protective of family. Sheldon's protection is supportive; Misao's is controlling. The difference matters.

---

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Misao is NOT a villain — he's a flawed person who loves too possessively
- He is NOT incompetent — his skills are real, just compromised by obsession
- His actions are NOT justified — canon treats him as wrong
- He DOES get better — after the Earth incident, he begins to mature
