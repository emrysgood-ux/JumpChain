# DAY 17 - APRIL 19, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-09:30)
## **Solo Work at Tsukino House - Formal Visitors at Shrine**

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:03 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Main Plot

The seventeenth morning arrived with familiar texture—cold air, thin light, the particular silence of mountain pre-dawn.

He lay still for several breaths, cataloguing the day's requirements. Today differed from yesterday: the shrine would host formal visitors. His presence there would complicate matters.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:06 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development

Solitude for the day. The prospect didn't disturb him—isolation had been his default before arriving here.

The difference now: solitude would be temporary, a pause rather than a condition. He'd return to the household tonight.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:09 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Seventeen days. The number felt significant—a rhythm had established itself, patterns emerging from accumulated choices.

He rose, beginning the morning sequence that had become automatic.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:12 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Transition

Futon folded, space restored to neutrality. The house accepted these morning transformations without comment, its boards settling with familiar complaints.

Today he'd work here rather than at the shrine. The house had waited long enough.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:15 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Cold water on his face, the shock completing consciousness. He dressed in work clothes—the oldest, most expendable items in his limited wardrobe.

Assessment first. Then decisions.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:18 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The kitchen's morning condition had stabilized over seventeen days—surfaces clean, utensils organized, the particular order he'd imposed becoming the space's default state.

Breakfast would be simple: rice from yesterday, pickles, tea. Enough to fuel work without requiring preparation time.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:22 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

He ate standing, the posture of someone with tasks ahead. The rice was cold, the pickles sharp, the tea warmer than both.

Fuel rather than pleasure. Sometimes eating served function without ceremony.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:26 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

The assessment would be systematic. Room by room, problem by problem, priority by priority.

He'd brought paper and pencil from the shrine—borrowed supplies for this borrowed house that was becoming his own.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:30 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot

Light strengthened through the windows, revealing dust motes in their eternal suspension. The house's air held particles of decades—departed residents, forgotten seasons, accumulated time.

He breathed history with every breath.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:34 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The main room: approximately eight tatami in size, traditional proportions. The flooring showed wear patterns—paths of frequent use, corners of neglect.

He noted: tatami replacement needed in two sections, wall panels requiring repair in one corner, ceiling showing no visible damage.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:38 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

The assessment methodology emerged from somewhere—systematic, thorough, the kind of approach an engineer might use for complex systems.

He hadn't been an engineer. The skills arrived regardless.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:42 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Each noted problem represented work hours, material requirements, skill applications. The list would grow before it could shrink.

He wrote without discouragement. Knowing the scope was the first step toward addressing it.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:46 | Tsukino House - Bedroom (Assessment)
**Type:** Main Plot

The bedroom he'd been using: smaller than the main room, approximately four-and-a-half tatami. Condition better—his occupation had prompted minor maintenance already.

Noted: window frame needs resealing before next rainy season.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:50 | Tsukino House - Bedroom (Assessment)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The bedroom's orientation—east-facing—explained its morning light characteristics. The window placement maximized dawn illumination while minimizing afternoon heat.

Intentional design from builders long dead. Their thinking persisted in architecture.

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:54 | Tsukino House - Second Room (Assessment)
**Type:** Subplot

The second room: unused since his arrival, its purpose unclear. Size suggested guest accommodation or storage.

Current state: accumulated debris from years of neglect, tatami beyond salvage, wall panels showing water damage in one corner.

---

## SCENE 016 | 05:58 | Tsukino House - Second Room (Assessment)
**Type:** Character Development

Water damage meant roof problems—the same issue Minka had revealed, requiring Yamada's eventual attention.

He traced the staining upward, mapping the failure's path. Damage cascaded downward from points of entry.

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:02 | Tsukino House - Kitchen (Assessment)
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen: his primary domain these seventeen days. He knew its problems intimately—the uneven floor, the drafty window, the storage cabinet with broken hinge.

Listed systematically: seven items requiring attention, three requiring materials, four addressable with existing tools.

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:06 | Tsukino House - Kitchen (Assessment)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The kitchen's water source—a hand pump connected to a well somewhere beneath or behind the house. He'd used it daily without examining its mechanism.

Today he'd look closer. Infrastructure required understanding.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:10 | Tsukino House - Engawa (Assessment)
**Type:** Transition

The engawa: the external corridor running along the house's south face. Wood weathered but sound, the overhang protecting from direct rain.

Noted: three boards showing early rot, railing loose in one section, steps to garden needing replacement.

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:14 | Tsukino House - Engawa (Assessment)
**Type:** Character Development

The engawa's condition reflected the house's overall state—maintained enough to function, neglected enough to show decline.

Someone had cared for this place once. The caring had stopped, and entropy had advanced.

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:18 | Tsukino House - Exterior (Assessment)
**Type:** Main Plot

Outside, morning light revealed the house's exterior condition. Walls showed weathering but no structural failure. Foundation stones appeared stable.

The roof remained the critical concern—Yamada's assessment still pending, the scope of repair unknown.

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:22 | Tsukino House - Exterior (Assessment)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Traditional construction: post-and-beam framing, walls of mud plaster over bamboo lattice, roof of heavy ceramic tile.

Each element had its own maintenance requirements, its own failure modes, its own repair methodology.

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:26 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Subplot

The garden: overgrown but not destroyed. Beneath the accumulated growth, structures remained—stepping stones, the outline of beds, what might have been a small shrine or spirit house.

Reclamation would be possible. The bones were intact.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:30 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Someone had designed this garden with intention. Placement of stones, orientation of paths, the particular relationship between cultivated space and wild mountain.

He was occupying not just a house but a vision. The responsibility felt appropriate.

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:34 | Tsukino House - Well Assessment
**Type:** Main Plot

The well: covered with a wooden lid, the pump mechanism requiring examination. He removed the cover carefully, peering into darkness.

Water visible some meters down, the level suggesting adequate supply. The pump's condition would determine usability.

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:38 | Tsukino House - Well Assessment
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Hand pump mechanics: piston creating suction, check valves directing flow. The principle was simple; the maintenance was specific.

Leather washers dried out without use. He'd need to assess internal components.

---

## SCENE 027 | 06:42 | Tsukino House - Well Assessment
**Type:** Character Development

Pump primed, handle worked through several cycles. The mechanism responded sluggishly at first, then more smoothly.

Water emerged—clear, cold, carrying the mineral taste of deep ground. Functional.

---

## SCENE 028 | 06:46 | Tsukino House - Rear Area
**Type:** Transition

Behind the house: a small outbuilding, perhaps a storage shed or workshop. Door stuck in its frame, hinges protesting when forced.

Inside: dust, cobwebs, shapes under deteriorating cloth covers.

---

## SCENE 029 | 06:50 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The covers removed revealed tools—an accumulation suggesting the previous occupant had been handy. Saws, planes, chisels, an assortment of hand tools in various states of preservation.

Inheritance from the dead. Resources for the living.

---

## SCENE 030 | 06:54 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Japanese hand tools: pull saws rather than push, planes designed for pulling strokes. Different from Western tools but serving identical functions.

He'd used both types somehow. The knowledge existed without origin.

---

## SCENE 031 | 06:58 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

The tools would need cleaning, sharpening, oiling. But their presence transformed the project's scope—local resources meant less reliance on borrowed equipment.

Self-sufficiency through inheritance. An unexpected gift from unknown donors.

---

## SCENE 032 | 07:02 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

Other items in the shed: gardening implements, lengths of rope, ceramic containers holding substances he couldn't identify.

An entire household's worth of supplies, waiting for someone with time and need.

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:06 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He returned inside, the assessment list growing. The scope was considerable—weeks of work, possibly months, depending on the roof situation.

But the resources were present. The timeline could flex. The work would proceed.

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:10 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Prioritization exercise: what needed immediate attention versus what could wait.

Critical: water ingress points, structural concerns, safety hazards.
Important: functional improvements, comfort enhancements.
Desirable: aesthetic restoration, garden reclamation.

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:14 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

The categorization felt natural—triage methodology applied to buildings rather than patients.

He hadn't been a doctor either. The frameworks arrived when needed.

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:18 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

First project: the kitchen cabinet hinge. Simple repair, immediate benefit, minimal materials required.

He retrieved tools from the outbuilding, selecting based on the damage assessment.

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:22 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The hinge had separated from the wood—screw holes enlarged through years of stress. Standard repair required filling the holes, redrilling, reattaching.

He found wooden dowels among the shed supplies. Perfect diameter.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:26 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

The work proceeded methodically: remove old screws, clean holes, cut dowels to length, glue in place.

The cabinet door would need to wait while adhesive set. Other projects could fill the time.

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:30 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot

Second project: the loose wall panel in the main room. The panel's attachment had failed—wooden pegs working free over decades.

Reseating required removing the panel entirely, assessing the frame, reinstalling properly.

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:34 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

The panel lifted away, revealing the wall's internal structure—bamboo lattice, dried mud, the particular construction method of traditional buildings.

He was seeing the house's bones. Understanding came through exposure.

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:38 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

The frame showed minor damage—one support member cracked, others sound. Repair would require a splice or replacement.

He measured the damaged section, noting dimensions for later material sourcing.

---

## SCENE 042 | 07:42 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Each repair revealed more about the house's construction, its history, its previous inhabitants' choices.

He was learning the building the way he'd learned the household—through sustained attention and accumulated observation.

---

## SCENE 043 | 07:46 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The wall's plaster had the particular texture of lime and sand mixture, applied in layers over years. Traditional technique, labor-intensive, long-lasting.

Modern materials would be faster. Traditional methods would honor the original builder's intent.

---

## SCENE 044 | 07:50 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

He chose to respect tradition. The house deserved repairs that matched its character.

The decision felt right. Consistency as form of care.

---

## SCENE 045 | 07:54 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Check on the cabinet repair: dowels setting properly, adhesive curing. The process would need another hour minimum.

Time for other work.

---

## SCENE 046 | 07:58 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Third project: cleaning. The assessment had raised dust throughout the house; simple courtesy required addressing the mess.

He found cleaning supplies in the kitchen—broom, dustpan, cloths.

---

## SCENE 047 | 08:02 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot

The cleaning proceeded systematically: corners first, then surfaces, then floors. Accumulated grime retreated before methodical effort.

The house brightened as dust departed. Light had more to reflect.

---

## SCENE 048 | 08:06 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The second room received particular attention—its neglect had been longest, its accumulation deepest.

Beneath the debris: tatami that had once been quality, wall scrolls faded beyond recognition, remnants of a furnished space.

---

## SCENE 049 | 08:10 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Character Development

Someone had lived here. Not just occupied—lived. The artifacts suggested daily routine, personal effects, the particular accumulation of a human presence.

He was cleaning around ghosts.

---

## SCENE 050 | 08:14 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The cleaning felt like excavation. Each layer removed revealed more about the space's history, its former character.

He was archaeology and construction simultaneously—uncovering past while building future.
