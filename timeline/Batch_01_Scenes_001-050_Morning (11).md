# DAY 6 - APRIL 8, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-10:00)

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:31 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room, waking

Saturday woke him later than weekdays—the body recognizing the absence of school routine, granting itself additional rest. Sheldon lay in the grey pre-dawn light and noticed the difference: no urgency, no countdown to the bus.

Weekends had their own rhythm. He was learning this one.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:35 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Guest room

The playdate occupied his morning thoughts. Today he would escort Tenchi to Keiko's house, meet her family, navigate social territory he had only glimpsed from the bus stop.

Guardian duty. The role still felt new.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:39 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Guest room

The futon folding went quickly—hands moving through the sequence without conscious direction, the motion compressed by six days of practice. What had taken ten minutes now took two.

Small efficiencies accumulated into substantial time.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:43 | Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Corridor

The house held weekend stillness—Katsuhito already at the shrine, probably, performing morning rituals that didn't pause for Saturday. Tenchi still asleep, storing energy for the day's anticipated activities.

Sheldon moved quietly, respecting the quiet.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:47 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Bathroom

Cold water on his face carried the mountain's temperature—lower today, a cold front having moved through overnight. His body accepted the shock with practiced equanimity.

Adaptation was complete for this particular challenge. Other challenges remained.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:51 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The kitchen fire was not yet lit—another sign of weekend schedule. Sheldon began the process himself: kindling arranged, match struck, the small ritual of coaxing flame from possibility.

Self-sufficiency. Another skill the shrine was teaching.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:56 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

The fire caught and established itself. Sheldon added larger wood, adjusted the draft, performed the small calibrations that transformed potential heat into actual warmth.

The physics of combustion was universal. The practice of fire-tending was local.

---

## SCENE 008 | 06:01 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen, preparing tea

Water for tea. The kettle's weight was familiar now—approximately four liters, enough for the morning's needs. His muscles had calibrated to this specific burden.

The body learned measurements the mind didn't consciously track.

---

## SCENE 009 | 06:06 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

The playdate invitation replayed in his mind—Keiko's mother's careful approach, the protocol of asking through the correct channel. Village social dynamics operated on rules he was still learning.

Today would provide more data. Today would teach.

---

## SCENE 010 | 06:11 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The kettle began to steam. Sheldon prepared the teapot, measured leaves by eye, performed the small ceremony that began each morning. Six days had made this sequence automatic.

Tea was ready. The day could properly begin.

---

## SCENE 011 | 06:16 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito arrived from the shrine, his morning rituals complete. The old man's expression held the particular calm that followed communion with whatever the shrine contained.

"You started the fire."

"It seemed necessary."

"It was. Thank you."

---

## SCENE 012 | 06:20 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

The acknowledgment was minimal but significant. Katsuhito didn't praise casually—each recognition was earned, each approval measured against standards Sheldon was still discovering.

"You started the fire" meant more than the words suggested.

---

## SCENE 013 | 06:24 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen, breakfast preparation

Breakfast would be simpler on weekends—the schedule didn't demand early completion, the rhythm was looser. Katsuhito moved through preparation with reduced urgency.

Even sacred time contained variation. The shrine breathed with the calendar.

---

## SCENE 014 | 06:29 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Hallway, checking on Tenchi

Sheldon checked Tenchi's room. The boy slept still, one arm flung across the futon, his face slack with the particular peace of childhood rest.

Let him sleep. The playdate wasn't until afternoon.

---

## SCENE 015 | 06:33 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Keiko's family," Sheldon said, testing the territory. "What should I know about them?"

Katsuhito considered. "Tanaka Hiroshi runs the sake shop. His wife, Yumi, manages most things. Keiko is their only child. They are... traditional."

---

## SCENE 016 | 06:37 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Traditional. The word carried weight in this context—respect for hierarchy, attention to propriety, expectations about how a guest should behave.

Sheldon filed the information. The preparation had begun.

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:42 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

"The sake shop has been in their family for four generations," Katsuhito continued. "They supply several shrines in the region, including this one. The relationship is old."

Business and religion intertwined. The village economy visible in its connections.

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:47 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Should I bring something? A gift?"

"Tea. The good tea, from the sealed tin. A small amount is sufficient. They will understand its meaning."

The ritual of gift-giving. Another layer of social navigation.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:52 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

The exchange of information felt deliberate—Katsuhito preparing Sheldon for an encounter that carried weight beyond a child's playdate. The Tanaka family was connected, respected. First impressions mattered.

"Thank you for telling me."

"The village requires preparation. You are learning to prepare."

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:57 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen, during breakfast

Breakfast was rice and pickles, miso soup with tofu—the familiar components arranged with weekend simplicity. Sheldon ate with attention, storing energy for the day's social demands.

Physical and social labor both required fuel.

---

## SCENE 021 | 07:03 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Tenchi's room doorway

Tenchi was stirring—the particular movements of a child approaching wakefulness, consciousness returning in stages. Sheldon waited in the doorway, allowing the process its natural pace.

"Good morning," he said when Tenchi's eyes opened.

"Is it time? Is it time for Keiko's house?"

---

## SCENE 022 | 07:06 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Tenchi's room

"Not yet. This afternoon. First, breakfast and morning chores."

The disappointment flickered across Tenchi's face, then resolved into acceptance. Children learned to wait. The lesson was ongoing.

"Okay. But we're still going?"

"We're still going. I promised."

---

## SCENE 023 | 07:10 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tenchi's room

Promises. Sheldon had made several now—to be present, to accompany, to keep the boy safe. Each promise was a thread binding him to this household, this child, this life.

The binding felt appropriate. The binding felt chosen.

---

## SCENE 024 | 07:15 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Bathroom

Morning hygiene for a weekend—slightly more thorough than weekday rushing, the leisurely attention to cleanliness that Saturday permitted. Tenchi's face-washing was theatrical, splashing that served expression as much as function.

Children found joy in mundane activities. Adults had forgotten how.

---

## SCENE 025 | 07:20 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen, with Tenchi

Tenchi ate with the distracted intensity of someone counting hours until an anticipated event. Each bite brought him closer to the playdate, the mathematics of time transformed into consumption.

"Slowly," Katsuhito reminded. "The food doesn't change whether you eat quickly or slowly. Only your enjoyment changes."

---

## SCENE 026 | 07:26 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"What will you play at Keiko's house?" Sheldon asked.

"Whatever we want! She has dolls and I have... I don't have anything." Tenchi's face fell. "I should bring a toy."

"Perhaps your grandfather has suggestions."

---

## SCENE 027 | 07:30 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito considered. "The wooden blocks. They are simple but versatile. Children find many uses for simple things."

The advice was practical and, Sheldon suspected, philosophical. Simplicity as foundation for complexity.

---

## SCENE 028 | 07:35 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Tenchi's room, gathering blocks

The wooden blocks lived in a cloth bag in Tenchi's closet—handmade, probably, each piece slightly irregular in the way that handwork produced. Sheldon helped gather them while Tenchi bounced with anticipation.

"These will be perfect. Keiko doesn't have blocks. I can show her how to build."

---

## SCENE 029 | 07:40 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Tenchi's room

Teaching as gift. Tenchi's instinct was to share capability rather than merely possess objects. The boy had learned generosity somewhere—from his grandfather, from his absent father, from his dead mother.

Good instincts survived their teachers.

---

## SCENE 030 | 07:45 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main courtyard

The morning's remaining hours would be devoted to shrine work—not for Sheldon today, but for Katsuhito. Weekend visitors sometimes arrived for informal consultations. The priest needed to be available.

"I can manage Tenchi," Sheldon offered. "Until the playdate."

"Good. The candlesticks can wait until Monday."

---

## SCENE 031 | 07:51 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Near the worship hall

Tenchi wanted to show Sheldon his favorite places on the shrine grounds—the rock that looked like a turtle, the tree with the lowest climbable branch, the corner where mushrooms sometimes grew.

"This is where I found a beetle last summer. A huge one."

---

## SCENE 032 | 07:56 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Eastern garden

The eastern garden revealed itself differently through a child's tour. Tenchi pointed out features Sheldon had overlooked—a crack in a stone that held water for birds, a particular moss that was soft enough to touch, the angle where morning light made the gravel sparkle.

Children saw what adults filtered.

---

## SCENE 033 | 08:02 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Near Funaho tree

Tenchi approached the great tree with reverence that seemed instinctive rather than taught. The boy didn't touch the trunk, didn't climb the accessible lower branches. He simply stood and looked up.

"Grandpa says this tree is the oldest thing here."

"Older than the shrine?"

"Older than everything."

---

## SCENE 034 | 08:07 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Near Funaho tree

The tree—Funaho, Katsuhito had nearly called it before redirecting—dominated this section of the grounds. Its branches spread in patterns that suggested intention, each limb positioned to receive maximum light.

Trees didn't have intention. And yet.

---

## SCENE 035 | 08:12 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Near Funaho tree

Tenchi slipped his hand into Sheldon's. "The tree watches. Grandpa told me. It watches everything that happens at the shrine."

The claim was impossible. The claim felt true.

"What does it see?"

"I don't know. But it sees."

---

## SCENE 036 | 08:17 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Forest edge

The tour continued to the forest edge, where the boundary between shrine and wild began its negotiation. Tenchi pointed out the path to the cave—sealed, forbidden, the subject of stern warnings.

"I'm not allowed to go there. Ever."

"Why not?"

"Grandpa says something dangerous lives there. Something sleeping."

---

## SCENE 037 | 08:22 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Forest edge, near cave path

The casual revelation struck Sheldon with unexpected force. Something dangerous. Something sleeping. The cave that was sealed and forbidden, containing whatever Katsuhito guarded against.

The shrine's mysteries multiplied. Each answer spawned new questions.

---

## SCENE 038 | 08:27 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Forest edge

He didn't press Tenchi for details—the boy had shared what he knew, which was probably less than the full truth. Katsuhito controlled information carefully. A four-year-old would receive only what was appropriate.

"That sounds scary."

"It's not scary. It's just... not allowed. Like the road without looking."

---

## SCENE 039 | 08:32 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Secondary shrine structure

They passed the forest boundary structure—the secondary shrine Sheldon had discovered during his fence work. Tenchi approached it with less reverence than the main complex, but still with care.

"This is for the forest. So the forest stays happy."

---

## SCENE 040 | 08:37 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Secondary shrine

Happy forests. Dangerous sleeping things. A tree that watched. Tenchi's cosmology was incomplete but consistent—the world was alive with presence, some benevolent, some dangerous, all requiring appropriate respect.

The child's understanding might be closer to truth than academic frameworks allowed.

---

## SCENE 041 | 08:42 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Kitchen approach

The tour concluded near the kitchen, where the smell of additional tea suggested Katsuhito had anticipated their return. Morning had advanced without urgency—the particular gift of weekends.

"Are you tired?" Sheldon asked Tenchi.

"No! I could walk forever!"

---

## SCENE 042 | 08:46 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

They sat together at the low table, tea and simple snacks between them. Katsuhito was absent—at the shrine, probably, attending to whatever weekend duties called.

"Tell me about Keiko," Sheldon said.

Tenchi launched into enthusiastic description: Keiko was the best at drawing. Keiko shared her lunch. Keiko's hair was really long.

---

## SCENE 043 | 08:52 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

The friendship was uncomplicated in the way childhood friendships could be—built on proximity and shared activity rather than compatibility testing. Keiko was nearby. Keiko was kind. Therefore Keiko was friend.

Adults complicated such things unnecessarily. Children knew what mattered.

---

## SCENE 044 | 08:58 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Her house has a garden too," Tenchi continued. "But it's different. There are flowers but no vegetables. Her mom likes flowers."

Different priorities. Different aesthetics. The village held multiple ways of being, each family expressing its values through space.

---

## SCENE 045 | 09:04 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

"What time should we leave?" Sheldon asked.

Tenchi's face scrunched with effort. "After lunch. Keiko's mom said after lunch."

"Then we have the whole morning to prepare."

The boy's expression suggested that preparation was less interesting than arrival, but he accepted the timeline.

---

## SCENE 046 | 09:10 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main room

The morning stretched ahead with relative freedom—no shrine work assigned, no specific obligations until the playdate. Sheldon found himself uncertain how to fill the time.

Structure had become comfortable. Unstructured time felt strange.

---

## SCENE 047 | 09:15 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room

"We could practice characters," Sheldon suggested.

Tenchi's enthusiasm dimmed slightly—homework on Saturday was not optimal—but he nodded. "A little. Then we can play?"

"Then we can play."

---

## SCENE 048 | 09:20 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main room, character practice

The character for "friend" today. Sheldon guided Tenchi's brush through the strokes, the meaning embedded in the practice.

"Yuu," Tenchi said, pronouncing the character. "Friend."

"That's right. Like Keiko."

---

## SCENE 049 | 09:26 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main room

The practice went quickly—Tenchi's attention span was limited on weekends, the pull of anticipated play competing with educational focus. After ten iterations, Sheldon declared success.

"Good work. Now we can play."

The boy's relief was palpable.

---

## SCENE 050 | 09:31 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room, playing with blocks

The wooden blocks became a tower, then a bridge, then something Tenchi called a "monster castle." Sheldon participated as assistant architect, following the boy's direction.

Play had its own logic. Adults who imposed adult structure missed the point.
