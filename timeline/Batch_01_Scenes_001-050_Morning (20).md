## **Yamada Wheel Pickup - Tanuki Carving Begins**

---

## SCENE 001 | 04:53 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Main Plot

Day nineteen arrived with distinct purpose: collect the wheel from Yamada, begin the tanuki carving.

Two days until Tenchi's birthday. The deadline focused everything.

---

## SCENE 002 | 04:57 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development

He'd slept at the Tsukino house, arriving late from the shrine to reduce morning travel time.

The houses had become interchangeable bases. Home was wherever he worked.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:01 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The tanuki carving waited. The wood selected, the tools purchased, the design visualized.

Today it would begin taking physical form.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:05 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Morning routine: cold water, stretching, the minimal breakfast that fueled early labor.

The shrine expected him by six. Time moved regardless of readiness.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:09 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The workshop called before the shrine. The tanuki wouldn't carve itself; every available moment mattered.

He retrieved the wood block and carving tools, examining them in the growing light.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:13 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The wood: hinoki cypress, softer than the puzzle box material, appropriate for detail work.

The tools: basic carving set from the village store, adequate for simple forms.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:17 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

He'd never carved before. The certainty of this fact sat alongside uncertainty about what would happen when tools met wood.

The pattern suggested capability would emerge. He trusted the pattern.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:21 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

First cut. The blade entered wood, revealing the lighter material beneath the weathered surface.

The motion felt... not wrong. Not masterful, but not wrong.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:25 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

The tanuki's basic form needed to emerge from the block. Round belly, distinct head, small pointed ears.

He began removing bulk material, working toward the shape hidden inside.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:29 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Carving was sculpture—revealing form rather than adding material. The inverse of construction.

The discipline felt familiar despite being new. The principles translated.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:33 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

Shavings accumulated as the form emerged. The belly's curve appeared first, the most prominent feature.

His hands found a rhythm. The wood responded to consistent attention.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:37 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The tanuki's proportions: belly prominent, head tilted with characteristic mischief, short limbs suggesting capability rather than elegance.

Folklore character captured in wood.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:41 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

Thirty minutes of work had established the basic shape. Details would require finer tools, more time.

Enough progress for the morning. The shrine awaited.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:45 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

He set the partially carved figure aside, hiding it with the puzzle box components.

The secret accumulated. Both items would appear together on birthday morning.

Quick cleanup, clothes changed to presentable condition. Sawdust brushed away, evidence concealed.

The Tsukino house kept its secrets.

The forest accepted his passage with familiar indifference.

The number had become mantra. The climbing, meditation.

Two days until the birthday. Two days until the gift revealed.
