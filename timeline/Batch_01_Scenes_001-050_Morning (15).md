# DAY 16 - APRIL 18, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-10:00)

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:03 | Guest Room
**Type:** Character Development

Sleep released him gradually, like a hand unclenching one finger at a time. No jolt. No disorientation. Just the slow return of ceiling beams, tatami smell, the particular stillness of pre-dawn mountain air pressing against paper screens.

Tuesday. His sixteenth day.

The wheel waited in the cart shed. Yamada waited in the western village. The day had purpose before his eyes finished opening.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:06 | Guest Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Sixteen days since he'd opened his eyes in a chrysanthemum field with no memory of arrival. Sixteen days of learning how his body moved through this world—how it climbed stairs without protest, how it lifted loads that should have challenged him, how it recovered from labor overnight instead of accumulating damage.

He'd stopped waiting for the debt collector. Whatever this gift cost, the bill hadn't come due yet.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:10 | Guest Room
**Type:** Character Development

His hands found the futon's edge in the darkness. Palms rougher than two weeks ago. Calluses forming in new patterns—gripping shovel handles, cart wood, rope. The physicist's hands becoming something else entirely.

Dorothy Mae had always said you could read a man's work in his hands. She'd approve of these changes, he thought. Labor made visible.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:14 | Guest Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The room held its own temperature—cooler than the shrine's main house but warmer than outside air. Spring mornings in Okayama straddled discomfort. Not cold enough for heating, not warm enough for windows open.

He'd learned to dress in layers. Remove one at midday, add it back at dusk. The simple physics of mountain living.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:18 | Guest Room
**Type:** Transition

He pushed himself upright, bare feet finding tatami. The straw mat gave slightly under his weight, familiar now. His first morning here, he'd nearly fallen—muscle memory expecting hardwood or carpet, finding something that shifted and breathed.

Now his body knew without thinking. Another small calibration complete.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:22 | Guest Room
**Type:** Character Development

His clothes waited where he'd folded them last night. Work pants, cotton shirt, the canvas jacket Katsuhito had provided from somewhere. Practical clothes for practical labor.

He dressed by feel, fingers finding buttons and seams without light. Another skill acquired. The accumulated expertise of sixteen mornings.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:26 | Guest Room - Window
**Type:** Worldbuilding

He slid open the shoji screen slightly. Pre-dawn gray filtered through, carrying the scent of damp earth and something floral—azalea blooms just beginning to open on the shrine grounds. 

The sky showed that particular luminescence that preceded sunrise by perhaps forty minutes. His body had learned to read this light, to calculate time without watches.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:29 | Guest Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Today's task sequence organized itself in his mind without effort. Prepare breakfast. See Tenchi to his bus. Transport the wheel to Yamada's workshop. Learn whatever the carpenter chose to teach.

Simple. Clear. The kind of day that made sense even when larger questions remained unanswered.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:33 | Path to Main House
**Type:** Transition

The stone path between guest quarters and main house glistened with overnight moisture. He moved carefully, testing each step's grip before committing weight. A twisted ankle now would complicate the wheel transport considerably.

Sixteen days had taught him mountain paths required respect regardless of apparent simplicity.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:37 | Path to Main House
**Type:** Worldbuilding

A spider had constructed an elaborate web between two azalea branches overnight—geometric precision spanning the gap like an architect's blueprint. He ducked beneath it rather than destroy the work.

The mountain accommodated multiple projects simultaneously. His presence was one thread in a larger weaving.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:40 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen held its overnight coolness when he entered through the side door. Familiar now—the clay stove's bulk, the arrangement of implements on their hooks, the particular way morning light would eventually angle through the high window.

His kitchen, functionally. The place where his usefulness took concrete form.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:43 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

He moved through preparation with acquired efficiency. Rice from the bin to the pot. Water measured by the second knuckle method Grandmother had taught forty years ago. The kettle filled and positioned on the stove.

Each action carried the weight of repetition. Sixteen mornings of the same sequence had transformed effort into reflex.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:47 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The clay stove required specific attention—kindling arranged in the pyramid structure that promoted airflow, larger wood positioned to catch once flames established. Matches struck against their box, that particular sulfur smell.

Fire-starting remained satisfying. The transformation of potential into actual heat, visible and useful.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:51 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Yesterday's gravel work had depleted their nearest supply. Three more days of hauling would exhaust the accessible deposit entirely, and the eastern location Katsuhito had mentioned remained unexplored.

Another task to schedule. Another thread in the growing web of responsibilities.

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:55 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The wheel transport presented its own logistical challenges. The removed wheel weighed perhaps thirty kilograms. The distance to Yamada's workshop—twenty minutes by direct path, perhaps thirty with a burden.

He'd carried heavier. But carrying heavy objects while maintaining balance on uneven terrain required planning, not just strength.

---

## SCENE 016 | 05:58 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Yamada had agreed to examine the wheel, to assess whether repair was possible or replacement necessary. A simple transaction on its surface—service for compensation, skill for currency.

But the carpenter had also offered something else. Teaching. Wood identification. The accumulated knowledge of a lifetime spent understanding grain and strength and purpose.

That gift had no clear price. Which made it more valuable, not less.

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:02 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The rice pot began its quiet bubbling, steam escaping around the lid's edge. He adjusted the fire—less heat now, letting moisture absorb rather than boil away.

Timing mattered. Too high for too long produced scorched bottoms. Too low produced undercooked centers. The physics remained constant; only attention varied.

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:06 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

He prepared miso soup while the rice finished. Dashi stock from yesterday's batch, warmed gently. Wakame seaweed measured by pinch. Tofu cut into uniform cubes—his knife skills had improved considerably since that first uncertain morning.

Simple food, made correctly. The foundation of everything more complex.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:10 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

Footsteps on the engawa outside—Katsuhito's particular rhythm. Unhurried, deliberately audible. The old man announced his presence rather than surprising anyone.

Courtesy or strategy? Perhaps both. Sixteen days hadn't yet revealed where consideration ended and calculation began in the priest's behavior.

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:13 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

"The kettle sings," Katsuhito observed from the doorway. "A pleasant sound to wake to."

"Good morning, Katsuhito-san." He removed the kettle from heat, preparing the old man's preferred hojicha. "The rice should be ready in fifteen minutes."

"Adequate time for morning prayers." The priest moved toward the shrine hall, a pattern as predictable as sunrise.

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:17 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

Alone again, he continued preparation. Pickled vegetables from the stone crock. Grilled fish—mackerel from yesterday's village supply. Each element simple, combined into something greater.

His grandmother had cooked this way. Making do with what existed. Finding completeness in limitation rather than abundance.

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:21 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The morning routine had become meditation of a sort. His hands moved, his mind drifted. Plans formed and refined without conscious direction.

Transport the wheel. Learn from Yamada. Return before afternoon's end. Cook dinner. Repeat tomorrow with variations.

The structure of days accumulated into the structure of a life.

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:25 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Light strengthened through the kitchen window—proper dawn arriving. The mountains to the east would be catching first sun now, their forested slopes shifting from gray to green.

He'd watched that transformation many mornings since arriving. It never quite repeated. Same mountains, same sun, different atmosphere each time.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:28 | Hallway - Tenchi's Room
**Type:** Relationship

Small sounds from Tenchi's room indicated waking—the particular rustle of a child's restless stirring, blankets pushed aside, feet hitting floor.

Tuesday meant kindergarten. Which meant school uniform, packed lunch, the yellow bus that climbed the mountain road at 7:45 precisely.

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:32 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

He began assembling Tenchi's bento—rice packed into the bottom compartment, yesterday's leftover chicken arranged on top, pickled vegetables in their separate section. The ritual of school lunch preparation, learned by observation and correction over the past weeks.

The boy had preferences. No bitter vegetables. Plenty of rice. Everything cut small enough to eat without struggle.

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:36 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

A physicist preparing bento boxes. A theoretical researcher assembling children's lunches with the care others might give to experimental apparatus.

The disconnect should have felt absurd. Instead it felt appropriate. Both activities required precision, attention, the application of knowledge to practical ends.

---

## SCENE 027 | 06:39 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

Tenchi appeared in the kitchen doorway, hair flattened on one side, school uniform half-buttoned. The particular dishevelment of a four-year-old who'd dressed himself without mirror or assistance.

"Good morning, Sheru-ji."

The nickname still warmed something in his chest each time. "Good morning, Tenchi-kun. Your buttons are uneven."

---

## SCENE 028 | 06:43 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

The boy looked down at his shirt, counting buttons to buttonholes. His face scrunched in concentration, then cleared as he identified the error.

"I started in the wrong place," Tenchi diagnosed.

"Easily fixed." He knelt, bringing himself to the child's level. "May I help?"

---

## SCENE 029 | 06:47 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

Small fingers fumbled with buttons while he waited. Tenchi wanted to do it himself—had insisted on that independence since Sheldon arrived—but the boy glanced up periodically, confirming the adult remained available if needed.

The dance of childhood autonomy. Wanting help nearby, wanting not to need it.

---

## SCENE 030 | 06:51 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

"Done," Tenchi announced, the shirt now properly aligned. Pride straightened his small shoulders.

"Well done." He stood, moving back to the stove. "Breakfast will be ready soon. Did you wash your face?"

The boy's expression answered before words could.

---

## SCENE 031 | 06:54 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Tenchi retreated toward the washroom, footsteps pattering on wood floors. The main house was small but efficiently arranged—kitchen, common room, two sleeping rooms, the washroom that Katsuhito maintained with military precision.

Water systems remained on his list to understand. Where the well drew from. How pipes connected. What required seasonal maintenance.

---

## SCENE 032 | 06:58 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Main Plot

He set the low table for breakfast—three places, three sets of chopsticks, the arrangement that had become standard. Katsuhito's spot faced the tokonoma alcove. Tenchi's seat had the best light. His own position completed the triangle.

Geometry of daily intimacy. Where you sat defined relationships as clearly as words.

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:02 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Relationship

Katsuhito returned from morning prayers, settling into his spot with the ease of decades. The old man moved differently in this space—more relaxed, less ceremonial. Private face rather than public mask.

"The wheel is ready for transport?"

"Yes. I was thinking late morning, after Tenchi's bus."

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:05 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Subplot

"Yamada-san is particular about his workspace," Katsuhito observed. "He prefers guests to enter through the side gate. The front is for customers."

Information that would have been discovered eventually. Offered now as a gift of foresight. The old man's way of smoothing paths without demanding credit.

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:09 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Tenchi emerged from the washroom, face damp, hair now aggressively combed. He crossed to his seat with the determined stride of someone who had accomplished morning requirements and expected recognition.

"I used the comb," he announced, settling cross-legged.

"I can tell. Very thorough."

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:13 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Breakfast proceeded through its comfortable sequence. Soup first—Tenchi drank his quickly, always. Then rice, fish, pickles. The boy ate with four-year-old enthusiasm, chopstick technique still developing but recognizably correct.

Katsuhito ate slowly, savoring. The contrasts of age made visible in meal consumption.

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:17 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He ate while observing, a habit that hadn't faded. The interplay of grandfather and grandson. The unspoken communications that passed between them—a raised eyebrow, a small smile, an adjustment of posture.

Family language that predated words. He was learning to read it, not yet fluent but no longer entirely foreign.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:21 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Relationship

"Sheru-ji," Tenchi said around a mouthful of rice, "where are you going today?"

"To see a carpenter about a wheel."

The boy processed this information. "Can I come?"

"You have school, Tenchi-kun. Perhaps another time."

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:25 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Character Development

The disappointment flickered across Tenchi's face, quickly schooled. A four-year-old learning that some activities required patience, that interesting things happened without him.

Sheldon recognized the expression. He'd worn it himself at that age, wanting to follow his father to the garage, being told the same words: another time.

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:29 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Subplot

"The carpenter has a cat," Katsuhito offered into the silence. "Perhaps Tenchi could visit when the work is complete. To see the wheel repaired."

The boy's face brightened. A promise made. A future excursion to anticipate.

"May I, Sheru-ji?"

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:33 | Main House - Common Room
**Type:** Relationship

"If Yamada-san agrees and your grandfather approves." Conditional acceptance, teaching the boy that permissions came in layers.

Tenchi nodded seriously, already calculating whose favor to cultivate. A child's politics, learning how cooperation functioned.

---

## SCENE 042 | 07:37 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Breakfast concluded with the customary gratitude—gochisosama deshita—and Sheldon collected dishes while Katsuhito retreated to dress for the day's shrine duties. Tenchi grabbed his bento box with both hands, treating it like precious cargo.

School bag. Hat. Shoes. The checklist of departure.

---

## SCENE 043 | 07:40 | Main House - Entrance
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The school bus arrived at the mountain road's curve at 7:45. The walk from the shrine took precisely five minutes at Tenchi's pace—short legs moving at approximately double adult stride frequency.

They'd calibrated this timing during the first week. Left at 7:40, arrived with margin for distraction.

---

## SCENE 044 | 07:43 | Shrine Steps - Upper
**Type:** Relationship

Tenchi chattered as they descended—about a friend at school who had a new pencil case, about the teacher's promise to read a story about dragons, about whether beetles could really fly or only hop.

The stream of consciousness that defined four-year-old communication. He listened, responded where expected, let the words wash over him like music without demanding meaning.

---

## SCENE 045 | 07:47 | Mountain Road - Bus Stop
**Type:** Main Plot

The yellow bus appeared around the curve precisely on schedule, its engine laboring against the grade. Other children waited at lower stops; Tenchi was the highest pickup, the first passenger each morning.

The door opened with a pneumatic wheeze. The driver—Yamamoto-san—nodded recognition.

---

## SCENE 046 | 07:49 | Mountain Road - Bus Stop
**Type:** Relationship

"Bye, Sheru-ji!" Tenchi scrambled up the bus steps, lunch box clutched protectively.

"Have a good day, Tenchi-kun."

The boy didn't look back—already focused on finding his preferred seat, on the day ahead, on the adventures school might provide.

---

## SCENE 047 | 07:52 | Mountain Road - Bus Stop
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He watched the bus disappear around the next curve, exhaust trailing in the morning air. The silence it left felt larger than its departure warranted.

Strange, how quickly a child's presence had become expected. How absence registered as vacancy rather than normalcy.

---

## SCENE 048 | 07:56 | Shrine Steps - Lower
**Type:** Character Development

He began the ascent back to the shrine, legs no longer protesting the 320 steps. Cardiovascular adaptation, muscle development—his body had reconfigured for this terrain over sixteen days.

The stairs that had challenged him on arrival now felt merely routine. Progress made physical.

---

## SCENE 049 | 08:12 | Cart Shed
**Type:** Main Plot

The wheel waited where he'd left it, leaning against the shed wall. Oak wood, iron banding, spoke construction that had served the cart for decades before something had stressed it beyond tolerance.

He examined the damage in better light. Hairline fractures along one spoke. Slight warping of the rim's alignment. Repairable? That was Yamada's determination to make.

---

## SCENE 050 | 08:18 | Cart Shed
**Type:** Subplot

He fashioned a carrying harness from rope, positioning the wheel on his back like an awkward pack. Thirty kilograms distributed across shoulders and hips, the iron band pressing through canvas jacket.

Twenty minutes to Yamada's workshop. Time to think, time to observe, time to practice carrying burdens without complaint.

The morning stretched ahead, full of purpose.

*Continuing to Batch 2 (Scenes 051-100)*
