# DAY 16 - APRIL 18, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 3: Scenes 101-150 (12:30-16:00)

---

## SCENE 101 | 12:32 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Rice steamed while miso reheated. Simple lunch—practical after a morning of walking and learning. He assembled two portions, adding pickled vegetables from the earthenware crock that never seemed to empty.

Katsuhito's footsteps approached from the main room.

---

## SCENE 102 | 12:35 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

"Yamada was helpful?"

"Very. Three days for the wheel. He'll let Tenchi visit to watch."

Katsuhito accepted the information with a slight nod, something like approval moving behind his eyes. "Good. The boy should learn how things are made."

---

## SCENE 103 | 12:38 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

They ate at the low table, afternoon light filtering through the shoji screens. The rice had cooked properly this time—he was learning the ratios, the timing, the particular patience Japanese cooking required.

Each grain separate but connected. The metaphor kept presenting itself.

---

## SCENE 104 | 12:42 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"This afternoon," Katsuhito said between bites, "I have a project. The shrine walkway has damaged boards. Winter damage—ice in the grain."

A question disguised as information. He recognized the pattern now.

"I could help."

---

## SCENE 105 | 12:45 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Subplot

"You have experience with wood repair?"

"Some." Not quite true. His hands remembered tools, but the memories felt borrowed. "Yamada explained how the wood reacts to seasons. I understand the principle."

Understanding principles and executing repairs were different things. But how would he know unless he tried?

---

## SCENE 106 | 12:48 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Character Development

The priest studied him—that careful assessment that never felt intrusive but missed nothing. Whatever he saw in Sheldon's face satisfied something.

"After lunch, then. The tools are in the shrine storage. We'll see what the boards need."

---

## SCENE 107 | 12:52 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

He finished his rice, conscious of the afternoon ahead. Carpentry. Actual construction work on a centuries-old shrine.

The responsibility felt appropriate. This place had welcomed him. Contributing to its maintenance seemed like repaying debt with labor rather than words.

---

## SCENE 108 | 12:56 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Dishes cleared and washed, the kitchen restored to its proper order. Katsuhito had disappeared toward the shrine, leaving him to follow when ready.

He dried his hands on the cloth by the sink. His fingers tingled slightly—anticipation, not anxiety.

---

## SCENE 109 | 13:02 | Shrine Grounds - Path
**Type:** Main Plot

The path to the shrine proper wound past the main house, through a small garden, under a wooden torii that marked the transition from domestic to sacred space.

He'd walked this path dozens of times now. Each time revealed new details—a stone he hadn't noticed, a moss pattern on a particular tree.

---

## SCENE 110 | 13:05 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The damaged section became obvious once Katsuhito pointed it out—three boards near the shrine's main entrance, their surfaces warped and splitting. The grain had lifted in places, creating hazards for bare feet or sandals.

"Winter water," Katsuhito confirmed. "Seeps in, freezes, expands."

---

## SCENE 111 | 13:08 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

The priest crouched, running his fingers along the damaged wood. His touch was diagnostic, reading information from texture that Sheldon couldn't yet perceive.

"The underlying structure is sound. Only the surface boards need replacement."

---

## SCENE 112 | 13:12 | Shrine Grounds - Storage
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The shrine storage held tools organized by function—cutting, measuring, joining, finishing. Each category occupied specific wall sections, the arrangement so logical it required no explanation.

Generations of shrine keepers had refined this system. He was merely the latest to benefit from their accumulated wisdom.

---

## SCENE 113 | 13:15 | Shrine Grounds - Storage
**Type:** Main Plot

"Saw. Plane. Measuring square. Chisels." Katsuhito handed each tool with deliberate care, naming them as he passed them across. "The wood is in the covered pile by the south wall. Cypress, already seasoned."

---

## SCENE 114 | 13:18 | Shrine Grounds - Storage
**Type:** Character Development

The tools felt familiar in his hands. Weight distributed correctly. Balance suited to their purpose. He adjusted his grip on the plane without thinking, finding the position that would give maximum control.

Muscle memory he shouldn't possess. The pattern continued.

---

## SCENE 115 | 13:22 | Shrine Grounds - Wood Storage
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The wood pile held boards of varying lengths, all cypress, all cut years ago and left to season under cover. He selected three that matched the walkway's existing dimensions—width, thickness, grain direction.

Yamada's morning lesson proved immediately useful. Same species, but boards from different trees showed different characters.

---

## SCENE 116 | 13:26 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

Katsuhito demonstrated the removal of the first damaged board—pry bar positioned to minimize stress on surrounding structure, leverage applied gradually rather than suddenly.

"The shrine has stood four hundred years. We don't rush."

---

## SCENE 117 | 13:30 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Subplot

The damaged board came free with a sound like a long exhale. Underneath, the supporting beams showed good condition—dark with age but solid, no rot, no insect damage.

Relief he hadn't known he was holding. The bones of this place remained strong.

---

## SCENE 118 | 13:34 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Character Development

He removed the second board himself, following the priest's technique. Pry bar positioned. Pressure applied. The wood resisted, then released.

His hands knew this work. The knowledge felt less borrowed now, more integrated. As if the skills had been waiting for context.

---

## SCENE 119 | 13:38 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

Third board. Faster now, the pattern established. He was working ahead of conscious thought, letting his body execute while his mind observed.

Katsuhito watched without comment. The silence felt like approval.

---

## SCENE 120 | 13:42 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The measuring square aligned against the replacement board, marking cut lines. He calculated twice before touching the saw—habit from a different life, where measurement errors cascaded into larger failures.

Here, the failure would be visible. A miscut board on a shrine walkway, testament to carelessness.

---

## SCENE 121 | 13:46 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The saw bit into cypress with a whisper. Proper sawing was about rhythm, not force—letting the teeth do their work while the arm provided guidance.

He'd never been taught this. Yet his stroke found the correct angle immediately.

---

## SCENE 122 | 13:50 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Character Development

The cut completed. Edge clean, angle precise. He examined the result with standards he couldn't explain, finding it acceptable.

Not perfect. Perfect would require years of practice. But acceptable for functional repair.

---

## SCENE 123 | 13:54 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Subplot

Katsuhito approached to examine the cut. His inspection was thorough—checking angle, examining grain exposure, testing the edge with his thumb.

"You've done this before."

Statement, not question. But the inflection invited explanation.

---

## SCENE 124 | 13:58 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Character Development

"Not that I remember." The truth, technically. His previous life had involved equations and laboratory equipment, not woodworking. Yet his hands disagreed with his memory.

"Perhaps it runs in the family," Katsuhito offered. "The Tsukinos were craftsmen, generations back."

---

## SCENE 125 | 14:02 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

A reasonable explanation. Genetic predisposition toward manual skills, dormant until activated by circumstance. He'd read papers on similar phenomena—muscle memory encoded beyond conscious experience.

Except he'd never met the Tsukinos. The fabricated history didn't include them.

---

## SCENE 126 | 14:06 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Second board measured and marked. The saw found its rhythm faster this time, the motion becoming automatic.

His mind wandered while his hands worked. Dangerous, perhaps, but the work continued without interruption.

---

## SCENE 127 | 14:10 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The plane smoothed the cut edge, removing saw marks and creating the chamfer that would prevent splinters. Each stroke lifted a thin curl of cypress, the wood releasing its scent with every pass.

Different from oak. Lighter, cleaner, with an almost citrus undertone.

---

## SCENE 128 | 14:14 | Shrine Grounds - Work Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Third board completed. Three replacement pieces, sized and finished, ready for installation. The work had taken less time than he'd estimated.

Katsuhito's slight nod confirmed the quality met requirements.

---

## SCENE 129 | 14:18 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

Installation began with the first board—fitting it into the gap, checking alignment against the surrounding structure. The wood needed minimal adjustment.

"Snug but not forced," Katsuhito advised. "The wood will move with seasons. It needs room to breathe."

---

## SCENE 130 | 14:22 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Character Development

He understood intuitively. Thermal expansion, moisture absorption, the natural cycles that would make a too-tight fit buckle or a too-loose fit rattle.

Physics applied to materials. His domain, translated into new medium.

---

## SCENE 131 | 14:26 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The wooden pegs that secured shrine construction required their own technique—pre-drilled holes, precise diameter, insertion angle calculated to distribute stress. Metal nails would rust, would damage the surrounding wood, would eventually fail.

Wood joining wood lasted centuries.

---

## SCENE 132 | 14:30 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

First board secured. He stepped back to assess the result—new wood paler than the surrounding weathered cypress, but grain direction matched, surface level flush.

Time and weather would blend the colors. Function mattered more than immediate appearance.

---

## SCENE 133 | 14:34 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Subplot

"The boy who built this shrine," Katsuhito said, watching him position the second board, "was perhaps your age when he learned. He made many mistakes before achieving skill."

Boy implied young. Your age implied similar years. The priest's casual timeline didn't quite resolve.

---

## SCENE 134 | 14:38 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Four hundred years. The shrine had stood four hundred years. The "boy" who built it had lived in an entirely different Japan, under shoguns, before Western contact, before electricity.

Yet the skills transcended eras. Wood remained wood. Joints remained joints.

---

## SCENE 135 | 14:42 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

Second board secured. The rhythm of work had become meditative—measure, cut, fit, fasten. Each step leading to the next, each decision bounded by the requirements of the task.

His mind quieted in ways it rarely did otherwise.

---

## SCENE 136 | 14:46 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Character Development

This was what he'd missed in his previous work. Laboratory physics was abstract—numbers representing reality, equations describing behavior no one could directly observe.

Carpentry was immediate. Success or failure visible in every cut.

---

## SCENE 137 | 14:50 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

Third board. Final piece. He worked with particular care, aware that completion approached. The last board required the most precision—it had to fit the remaining gap exactly, no tolerance for error.

He measured three times. Cut once.

---

## SCENE 138 | 14:54 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Subplot

The fit was precise. Not lucky precise—calculated precise. He'd accounted for saw width, planing reduction, seasonal swelling.

Katsuhito's eyebrows lifted fractionally. The priest's version of surprise.

---

## SCENE 139 | 14:58 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Main Plot

Pegs driven. Board secured. The walkway was whole again, three pale rectangles in a field of weathered gray.

He stood back, tools still in hand, examining the work with the critical eye he couldn't suppress.

---

## SCENE 140 | 15:02 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Character Development

"Acceptable work." Katsuhito's assessment came after his own inspection—walking the repaired section, testing for flex, examining the joins.

Acceptable. From the priest, high praise. Excellence took decades. Acceptability after a single afternoon suggested aptitude.

---

## SCENE 141 | 15:06 | Shrine Grounds - Walkway
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He cleaned the tools methodically, removing wood shavings, checking edges for damage. The borrowed skill had served well, but questions remained.

Where did these abilities come from? Genetic inheritance explained some things. This felt like more.

---

## SCENE 142 | 15:10 | Shrine Grounds - Storage
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Each tool returned to its designated place, the storage room's order maintained across generations. Someone—many someones—had cared enough to establish and preserve this system.

He was now part of that chain. A link in continuity he hadn't asked for but couldn't refuse.

---

## SCENE 143 | 15:14 | Shrine Grounds - Path
**Type:** Transition

The afternoon had shifted while he worked. Light came from a different angle now, shadows lengthened, the shrine's atmosphere changed from bright to contemplative.

Tenchi would return from school soon. The day's rhythm continuing.

---

## SCENE 144 | 15:18 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Main Plot

Katsuhito had settled on the engawa with tea, a second cup already poured, waiting. The invitation was silent but clear.

He sat, accepting the cup, letting the afternoon's work settle into his muscles and his mind.

---

## SCENE 145 | 15:22 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Relationship

"Yamada will be interested to hear about your work today."

A statement that connected morning and afternoon—the wheel craftsman and the shrine repair, different applications of similar principles.

"He mentioned bringing Tenchi to watch the wheel repair."

---

## SCENE 146 | 15:26 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Subplot

"Good." The priest sipped his tea, gaze directed at the garden rather than Sheldon. "The boy should see how things are made. How they're maintained. This knowledge fades with each generation."

A lament disguised as observation. The old man mourning skills being forgotten.

---

## SCENE 147 | 15:30 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The garden showed signs of careful tending—no weeds, plants positioned for aesthetic effect, stones placed with deliberate randomness that was actually precise composition.

Another craft. Another skill set developed over centuries, transmitted through demonstration and practice.

---

## SCENE 148 | 15:34 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He thought about his grandmother's hands. Rough with work, gentle with children. She'd known things—how to grow food, how to preserve it, how to mend clothing and fix tools.

Knowledge he'd dismissed as outdated was proving essential here.

---

## SCENE 149 | 15:38 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Character Development

The tea cooled as he held it, warmth fading from ceramic to palm. He'd accomplished something today. Tangible, visible, useful.

More satisfying than any equation he'd ever solved. The thought surprised him with its certainty.

---

## SCENE 150 | 15:42 | Main House - Engawa
**Type:** Transition

Distant sounds from the road below—the school bus arriving, children's voices dispersing toward homes. Tenchi would appear soon, full of the day's events, eager to share.

He finished his tea and stood. Time to prepare for the afternoon's next phase.

---
