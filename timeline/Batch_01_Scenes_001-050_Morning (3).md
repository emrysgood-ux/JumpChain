# DAY 14 - APRIL 16, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-10:00)

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:04 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Guest room, waking

Fourteen days. The number arrived with consciousness, carrying the weight of two weeks survived, adapted, transformed. Today would bring the house—his house, the inheritance he still didn't fully understand.

Light pressed against the paper screen. Sunday morning. No alarms, no schedules, only the day's own rhythm.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:08 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room

The body rose without the protests of earlier mornings. Two weeks of physical labor had reshaped him—not dramatically, but noticeably. The stiffness was gone. The soreness had become strength.

He folded the futon in eighty-seven seconds. Progress measured in saved time.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:12 | Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Corridor

The corridor's morning chill had become familiar background, no longer demanding attention. His body had recalibrated its expectations. Cold was context, not assault.

Sunday's particular silence held the house—no bus to catch, no routines to observe. The day waited for its inhabitants to define it.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:16 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Bathroom

Morning rituals proceeded without thought. Face, teeth, the systematic preparation of a body that would meet its inheritance today. The Tsukino house waited somewhere on the eastern slope, patient as any house, holding whatever Kiyoshi had left behind.

The mirror showed a face that was becoming unfamiliar through familiarity. He knew this face now. He was growing into it.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:21 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The fire needed building. Sheldon knelt before the stove and arranged kindling with the competence of two weeks' practice—airflow first, then structure, then the match that would bring heat from potential into actuality.

The flame caught. The morning began properly.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:26 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito appeared while the water was still heating—the old man's timing uncanny as always, his presence registering before his footsteps had announced him.

"You're awake early."

"The house," Sheldon said. "I couldn't sleep past dawn."

"Anticipation or anxiety?"

"Both."

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:30 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito accepted this honesty with a nod. "Houses reveal themselves slowly. The first visit will show the surface. The deeper truth takes time."

"How much time?"

"As much as the house requires. Some reveal themselves in days. Some take years."

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:35 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

Years. The timeline stretched before Sheldon—not days or weeks but years of learning what the Tsukino house contained, what Kiyoshi had built, what he was being asked to continue.

"My uncle lived there alone?"

"For nearly four decades after your grandmother passed. The house knew only him."

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:40 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

Four decades of solitary habitation. The house had absorbed Kiyoshi's presence, his habits, his particular way of being in the world. Sheldon would be entering not just a building but a memorial.

"Did he have visitors?"

"Rarely. Kiyoshi preferred his garden and his solitude. The village respected this."

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:45 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The kettle sang. Sheldon poured water over tea leaves and watched the color bloom—the same ritual, the same sequence, but today carrying different weight. Today he would see where his blood came from.

"After breakfast," Katsuhito said. "The path is easier in morning light."

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:50 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Breakfast was rice and pickles, the simplest configuration of morning food. Sheldon ate without tasting, his mind already walking paths he had never walked, opening doors he had never seen.

The house waited. He could feel it waiting.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:55 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main room

Tenchi appeared in the doorway, still soft with sleep, his hair disordered. "Is today the house day?"

"Today is the house day."

"Can I come?"

"Not this time," Katsuhito answered. "First meetings require privacy."

---

## SCENE 013 | 06:00 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Main room

The boy's disappointment was visible but brief—Katsuhito's explanations carried authority that didn't require argument. Tenchi accepted and redirected.

"Will you tell me about it after?"

"Everything I can describe," Sheldon promised. "Every room, every corner."

---

## SCENE 014 | 06:05 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen, finishing breakfast

The meal concluded. Sheldon washed his dishes with the attention the task demanded, the routine steadying nerves that had begun to fray.

"Ready?" Katsuhito asked.

No. "Yes."

---

## SCENE 015 | 06:10 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Entrance area

Shoes. The simple act of putting on shoes felt significant—crossing the threshold from known space into unknown, from the shrine that had sheltered him into the world that waited.

"The path is not difficult," Katsuhito said. "But attention is required."

---

## SCENE 016 | 06:15 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main entrance

The shrine grounds glowed with Sunday morning's particular light—unhurried, generous, the sun giving rather than demanding. The great tree stood sentinel as always, its presence a constant Sheldon had learned to lean against.

They turned not toward the steps but toward a smaller path Sheldon hadn't noticed before.

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:18 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Eastern path entrance

"The eastern way," Katsuhito said. "It connects the shrine to what was here before. Your family's land."

The path was narrow, marked by stones that had clearly been placed with intention. Ancient intention, the placement predating the shrine's current form.

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:22 | Forest Trail - Eastern Path
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Eastern path

The forest accepted them differently here—older trees, less undergrowth, a sense of walking through space that had been cleared and maintained for longer than Sheldon could calculate.

"This path," he said. "How old?"

"The Tsukino family has lived on this mountain for over four centuries. Draw your own conclusions."

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:26 | Forest Trail - Eastern Path
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Eastern path

Four centuries. His blood had walked this specific path for four hundred years. The thought was disorienting—his new life connecting to lineage that predated nations he'd studied, histories he'd consumed.

He was not new here. His name had been here for generations.

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:30 | Forest Trail - Eastern Path
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Eastern path, climbing

The path climbed gradually, following the mountain's contour rather than fighting it. Whoever had laid these stones understood terrain—not the brutal efficiency of modern construction but something older, more collaborative.

"The path was built by the Tsukino family?"

"Built, maintained, rebuilt. Each generation adds to what the previous established."

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:35 | Forest Trail - Eastern Path
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Eastern path, marker stone

A stone appeared at the path's edge—carved with characters Sheldon couldn't read, worn by weather that had polished it for centuries. Katsuhito paused.

"The boundary marker. Beyond this, you are on Tsukino land."

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:38 | Forest Trail - Eastern Path
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Boundary marker

Sheldon stood at the marker and felt something shift. Not physically, not visibly, but some internal boundary adjusting itself. He was entering territory that was his—legally, historically, by blood he now carried.

"I feel it," he said, surprising himself.

"The land knows its own."

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:42 | Tsukino Land - Eastern Path
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Tsukino territory

The path beyond the marker was different—better maintained, despite no one living to maintain it. Or perhaps the land itself preserved what belonged to it.

"Who has been keeping this clear?"

"The path maintains itself. The family's intention persists."

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:46 | Tsukino Land - Eastern Path
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tsukino territory

The trees here were marked—subtle notches in bark, nearly invisible unless you knew to look. Sheldon noticed them because he had learned to notice over two weeks of observation.

"Property markers?"

"Memory markers. Each notch commemorates something. Births, deaths, significant events."

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:50 | Tsukino Land - Eastern Path
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Approaching house

The path curved, and through a gap in the trees, a structure became visible—not the house itself but something smaller. A shed, perhaps. An outbuilding.

"The tool shed," Katsuhito confirmed. "Kiyoshi's garden required equipment."

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:54 | Tsukino Land - Tool Shed
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Near tool shed

The shed was well-built—cedar construction, traditional joinery, the same craftsmanship Sheldon had learned to recognize at the shrine. It sat at the edge of what appeared to be a cleared area, waiting.

"The garden?"

"What remains of it. Four years of neglect have taken their toll."

---

## SCENE 027 | 06:58 | Tsukino Land - Garden Edge
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kiyoshi's garden perimeter

The garden revealed itself gradually—not the cultivated order Sheldon expected but something wilder, plants reclaiming space that human intention had once contained. The bones of design were visible beneath the overgrowth.

"He died four years ago?"

"In this garden. Working, as he preferred."

---

## SCENE 028 | 07:02 | Tsukino Land - Garden
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kiyoshi's garden

Sheldon stepped into the garden's edge and felt vegetation brush his ankles. Waist-high in places, chest-high in others, the plants had followed their own logic in Kiyoshi's absence.

But the paths were still there. The stones still showed where feet should fall.

---

## SCENE 029 | 07:06 | Tsukino Land - Garden
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kiyoshi's garden

"This will need work," Sheldon said.

"Yes. But the foundation remains. What Kiyoshi built can be restored if someone is willing."

The implicit question hung between them. Was he willing?

---

## SCENE 030 | 07:10 | Tsukino Land - Garden
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kiyoshi's garden

Sheldon walked deeper into the overgrowth, following stone paths that his uncle had laid decades ago. The plants weren't aggressive—they were simply alive, following their nature in the absence of guidance.

"I'm willing," he said.

---

## SCENE 031 | 07:14 | Tsukino Land - Garden
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kiyoshi's garden

Katsuhito's expression shifted—something that might have been relief, might have been approval. "Kiyone will teach you about cultivated gardens. This garden requires different knowledge."

"What knowledge?"

"The knowledge of wild things that want to be tamed. Of order that emerges from patience."

---

## SCENE 032 | 07:18 | Tsukino Land - Garden
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kiyoshi's garden, deeper

The garden's depth was surprising—larger than the shrine's grounds, extending into forest that had been shaped rather than cleared. Sheldon could see where trees had been placed, where water had been directed, where stone had been positioned.

"How big is this?"

"Three acres at Kiyoshi's death. More, now that the forest is reclaiming edges."

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:22 | Tsukino Land - House Approach
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Path to house

The path led through the garden toward a structure that had been invisible until they were nearly upon it. The house sat in a clearing, its roof visible now through thinning vegetation.

Traditional construction. Two stories. Cedar and tile. Home.

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:26 | Tsukino Land - House Exterior
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** House exterior

The house was larger than Sheldon had expected—not grand, but substantial. Traditional minka design, adapted for mountain climate. The engawa wrapped the visible sides, its wood weathered but solid.

"Built when?"

"The current structure is perhaps two hundred years old. It replaced an older house that fire claimed."

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:30 | Tsukino Land - House Exterior
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** House exterior, surveying

Two hundred years of habitation, of births and deaths, of meals prepared and futures planned. The house had held Tsukino lives through changes that Sheldon could barely imagine—feudal Japan, Meiji restoration, world wars, modernity.

And now it would hold him.

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:34 | Tsukino Land - House Entrance
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** House entrance

The entrance faced south, sheltered by the mountain's slope, positioned to catch winter sun and shed summer heat. Katsuhito produced a key—old iron, worn smooth by hands that had used it for generations.

"Kiyoshi left this in the shrine's keeping. Now it passes to you."

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:37 | Tsukino Land - House Entrance
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** House entrance

The key's weight in his hand was surprising—heavier than modern keys, substantial in a way that suggested intention. This object had opened this door for perhaps two centuries.

Sheldon inserted it into the lock. The mechanism turned with unexpected smoothness.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:40 | Tsukino House - Entry
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** House entry (genkan)

The door opened onto darkness—not the darkness of abandonment but the particular dimness of a house that had been closed, waiting. The smell was cedar and dust and something else, something that might have been memory.

He stepped inside and felt the house acknowledge him.

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:43 | Tsukino House - Entry
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** House entry

The genkan was traditional—a step down where shoes were removed, a step up into the living space. Slippers waited in a row, dusty but intact, patient as any object that knew its purpose.

Sheldon removed his shoes. The house deserved that respect.

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:46 | Tsukino House - Entry
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** House entry

Katsuhito remained at the threshold. "The first walk through should be yours alone. I will wait in the garden."

"You're not coming in?"

"The house is meeting you. That meeting requires privacy."

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:49 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Main room (ima)

Sheldon stepped up from the genkan into the main room. Tatami mats, faded but intact. A household shrine in one corner, its altar closed. Low furniture covered in white cloths, protected against dust and time.

The house exhaled around him. He could feel it adjusting to his presence.

---

## SCENE 042 | 07:53 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room

Light filtered through papered windows, softened by accumulated dust, creating the particular glow of spaces that had held time inside themselves. Sheldon stood in the center of the room and let the house show itself.

Kiyoshi had sat here. Had eaten here. Had lived and eventually died here.

---

## SCENE 043 | 07:57 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main room, examining

The white cloths protected more than furniture—Sheldon lifted one to find a table of remarkable quality, dark wood polished to depth that seemed to hold light rather than reflect it.

"You cared about beauty," he said to the absent Kiyoshi. "You surrounded yourself with things that were beautiful."

---

## SCENE 044 | 08:01 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen (daidokoro)

The kitchen was through a sliding door—separate from the main room but connected, the traditional layout that kept cooking smells contained while allowing food to flow outward.

A stove, similar to the shrine's. A sink with a hand pump. Storage cabinets of surprising depth.

---

## SCENE 045 | 08:05 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

This was where Sheldon would cook—where his abilities would find their application, where the skills he was developing at the shrine would have a permanent home.

He touched the stove's surface. Cold, waiting, ready to heat when life returned.

---

## SCENE 046 | 08:09 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

The storage cabinets held dishes—ceramic bowls and plates, some chipped, most intact. Different styles from different eras, the accumulation of a household that had existed for generations.

He would eat from these. The thought carried weight.

---

## SCENE 047 | 08:13 | Tsukino House - Hallway
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Central hallway

A hallway connected the front rooms to whatever lay behind. The wood creaked under his weight—not complaint but acknowledgment, the house registering his passage.

Doors opened on either side. Rooms waiting to reveal themselves.

---

## SCENE 048 | 08:17 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Master bedroom

The first door revealed what must have been Kiyoshi's bedroom. A futon cabinet, closed. A low desk near the window. A simple room, functional, containing only what was necessary.

This was where his uncle had slept for forty years.

---

## SCENE 049 | 08:21 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Master bedroom

Sheldon stood in the doorway and let the room's presence settle around him. Kiyoshi had woken here each morning, had seen light through these windows, had risen to begin days that accumulated into a life.

Now different mornings would begin here. Different light through the same windows.

---

## SCENE 050 | 08:25 | Tsukino House - Storage Room
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Storage room

The next room was storage—tools, materials, the accumulated objects of household maintenance. Sheldon could see rope, canvas, metal implements whose purposes weren't immediately clear.

The house had been self-sufficient. Kiyoshi had kept what he needed.
