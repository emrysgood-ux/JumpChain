# DAY 18 - APRIL 20, 1989 (THURSDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (04:45-09:00)
## **Puzzle Box Construction Begins - Tenchi's Birthday Gift**

---

## SCENE 001 | 04:48 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Main Plot

Day eighteen arrived with purpose already formed. Four days until Tenchi's birthday. The gift required beginning.

He'd dreamed of interlocking pieces, sliding panels, hidden compartments. The design had clarified during sleep.

---

## SCENE 002 | 04:52 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development

A puzzle box. The idea had surfaced during yesterday's reflections—something made rather than purchased, something requiring thought to reveal its secrets.

Appropriate for a child who loved discovering how things worked.

---

## SCENE 003 | 04:56 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The design existed complete in his mind: three sliding panels, each movement enabling the next, the center compartment opening only when the sequence completed correctly.

He'd build something else to go inside. A small carving, perhaps.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:00 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Morning routine proceeded on automatic—water, stretching, the cold splash that confirmed consciousness.

Today would split between shrine duties and secret construction. The balance required planning.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:04 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Breakfast assembled from remaining supplies: rice, pickles, the last of the dried fish. He'd need to replenish from the shrine's stores.

Eating provided fuel for what the morning required.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:08 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The puzzle box design refined itself as he ate. Dimensions appropriate for small hands. Complexity calibrated to challenge without frustrating.

Wood selection would be critical—tight grain, smooth working, no splinters.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:12 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

He hadn't built puzzle boxes before. The certainty of this fact conflicted with the certainty of knowing how.

The pattern repeated. Skills arrived when circumstances required them.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:16 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The tool shed in pre-dawn darkness, lantern casting limited light. He searched for appropriate wood among the stored materials.

Scrap from the walkway repair—cypress, well-seasoned, exactly what the project required.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:20 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Cypress for the box body. Its natural oils resisted decay; its grain accepted precise work. Traditional choice for items meant to last.

The pieces selected, he measured and marked initial cuts.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:24 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

The tanuki carving would serve as the box's hidden treasure. The raccoon dog's folklore significance—luck and mischief combined—suited a child's gift.

A separate piece of wood, softer for carving detail.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:28 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

The saw moved through cypress with the particular sound of sharp teeth meeting dense wood. Each cut followed lines he'd marked, precision built into the motion.

His hands knew this work. They proceeded without requiring conscious direction.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:32 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Making something for someone. The activity felt different from repair work—not restoring what existed but creating what hadn't.

The distinction carried emotional weight he hadn't anticipated.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:36 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The box's outer panels cut: six pieces, precise dimensions, edges waiting for the joinery that would connect them.

Japanese puzzle boxes used no glue, no nails. Fit alone held them together.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:40 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The joinery type: rabbeted edges creating channels for sliding panels. The tolerances had to be exact—too tight prevented movement; too loose allowed rattling.

He'd cut test joints first, refining technique before committing to final pieces.

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:44 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

Test cuts in scrap wood, checking fit, adjusting blade angle. The chisel work for channel creation required particular attention.

The learning happened through doing. Each cut taught the next.

---

## SCENE 016 | 05:48 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Transition

Dawn light began supplementing the lantern's glow. The shed's interior emerged from shadow, tools and materials becoming fully visible.

Workable conditions for precision tasks.

---

## SCENE 017 | 05:52 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The chisel sliced thin layers, creating the channel that would guide the first sliding panel. The depth had to be consistent—uniform resistance throughout the panel's travel.

Patience governed the work. Rushing would ruin precision.

---

## SCENE 018 | 05:56 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The box would contain multiple secrets: the sequence that opened it, the tanuki hidden inside, the fact of its handmade origin.

Layers of meaning within a simple object. The thought pleased him.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:00 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

Channel completed on the first piece. He tested with a scrap panel—smooth movement, no binding, appropriate resistance.

The technique worked. He could proceed to final assembly components.

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:04 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

Time check: six o'clock. The shrine would expect him for morning duties. The construction would continue in evening hours.

He cleaned the workspace, securing partially completed pieces.

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:08 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Transition

Quick change from work clothes to presentable attire. The sawdust brushed away, evidence of secret project removed.

The gift's construction required secrecy. Surprise improved reception.

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:12 | Path to Shrine - Start
**Type:** Main Plot

The walk to the shrine began, morning light strengthening with each minute. His mind continued working on the puzzle box design, refining details for evening's work.

Physical presence at the shrine; mental presence with the project.

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:16 | Path to Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The forest showed continued spring advancement. Birdsong had increased in variety and volume—species returning from southern migrations, establishing territories.

The mountain's calendar proceeded independent of human concerns.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:20 | Path to Shrine - Stream
**Type:** Character Development

The stream crossing executed without conscious attention. His body had memorized the stone positions, the footing requirements.

Three weeks had converted deliberate navigation to automatic response.

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:24 | Shrine Steps - Lower
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Three hundred twenty steps. The count had become background rhythm rather than active monitoring.

Eighteen days of climbing had transformed challenge into routine.

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:32 | Shrine Steps - Upper
**Type:** Main Plot

The steps completed with breath to spare. The improvement from day one remained remarkable—then, he'd arrived gasping; now, merely warm.

Adaptation continued its quiet work.

---

## SCENE 027 | 06:36 | Shrine Grounds - Entry
**Type:** Transition

Through the torii, onto maintained grounds. The transition from wild to ordered, from path to destination.

The shrine waited with its morning requirements.

---

## SCENE 028 | 06:40 | Shrine Grounds - Main Path
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Dew still clung to grass and stone, the particular moisture of mountain mornings. It would burn away within hours, but now it freshened the air, sharpened the light.

Morning's blessing before day's heat.

---

## SCENE 029 | 06:44 | Main House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

The house showed signs of waking—smoke from the kitchen stove, sounds of movement within.

He entered through the genkan, announcing his presence through the familiar sounds of arrival.

---

## SCENE 030 | 06:48 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Relationship

Tenchi appeared immediately, the child's internal alarm apparently set to Sheldon's arrival time.

"You came from your house!"

"I did. The walk is pleasant this time of morning."

---

## SCENE 031 | 06:52 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

The boy's energy already operated at full capacity—the particular wakefulness of childhood that preceded caffeine dependency.

"Can we have eggs for breakfast?"

"If we have eggs, yes."

---

## SCENE 032 | 06:56 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen received him, its morning state awaiting transformation. Eggs confirmed present—eight in the cold storage, enough for the household with surplus.

Breakfast planning engaged.

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:00 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Tamagoyaki again, the rolled omelette that Tenchi favored. The technique had become reliable through repetition—layered cooking, careful rolling, the particular texture that resulted.

Comfort in competence.

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:04 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Katsuhito's preferences were simpler—miso soup, rice, pickles. The priest required less elaborate preparation, his attention directed toward other matters.

Feeding different needs from the same kitchen.

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:08 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The rice had been started—Katsuhito's contribution to morning routine, the task he'd performed for years before Sheldon's arrival.

Division of labor, established through practice.

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:12 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Eggs cracked, beaten, seasoned. The pan heated to precise temperature—too hot scorched, too cool prevented the layers from setting properly.

His hands found the rhythm, the sequence of pour-cook-roll repeating.

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:16 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Four days until Tenchi's birthday. The puzzle box construction would require careful scheduling—evening hours after the household settled, hidden work in the Tsukino outbuilding.

The secret added excitement to the gift.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:20 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Tamagoyaki completed, cooling on cutting board. Miso soup assembled from prepared components. The meal approached readiness.

"Tenchi, call Ojii-san for breakfast."

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:24 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Three settings, three people, the familiar configuration. Food arranged with the attention that had become standard.

"Itadakimasu."

The meal began.

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:28 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Relationship

"Four days until my birthday," Tenchi announced, the countdown apparently requiring daily verbal confirmation.

"Four days," Sheldon agreed. "Are you excited?"

"Very excited. Papa is coming."

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:32 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Character Development

Nobuyuki's visit for the birthday. The household would expand temporarily, the dynamics shifting with the additional presence.

He'd meet Tenchi's father. The prospect created mild anxiety.

---

## SCENE 042 | 07:36 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

"Your father works in Kurashiki?" Sheldon confirmed what he'd gathered from various conversations.

"He builds buildings. Important buildings that don't fall down."

"An architect. That's skilled work."

---

## SCENE 043 | 07:40 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Subplot

Katsuhito ate in his usual measured fashion, contributing silence rather than conversation. The priest observed without intruding, his attention distributed across multiple streams.

The household's anchor, present without demanding.

---

## SCENE 044 | 07:44 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"Can Sheldon-san meet Papa?"

The question addressed to the room at large, seeking permission that didn't strictly require asking.

"Of course," Katsuhito replied. "Sheldon is household. Family meets family."

---

## SCENE 045 | 07:48 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

"Sheldon is household." The priest's phrasing carried weight—not visitor, not guest, but household. A category with different implications.

The designation settled into him like the others had: quietly, persistently.

---

## SCENE 046 | 07:52 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Character Development

Meeting Nobuyuki would require... what? Explanation of his presence? Account of his background?

The questions couldn't be answered honestly. He'd have to navigate with partial truths.

---

## SCENE 047 | 07:56 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Transition

The meal concluded with satisfied sounds. Tenchi's enthusiasm for the day already building, his energy seeking outlet.

"Kindergarten soon," Katsuhito reminded. "Prepare yourself."

---

## SCENE 048 | 08:00 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Cleanup began, the morning routine's final phase. Sheldon washed while Tenchi prepared for his school day, the parallel activities filling the house with productive sound.

Routine as comfort. Structure as stability.

---

## SCENE 049 | 08:04 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Relationship

Tenchi reappeared, backpack secured, ready for the walk to the village kindergarten.

"Are you walking me today?"

"If Ojii-san agrees."

"I agree," came from elsewhere in the house. Permission granted without requiring visible presence.

---

## SCENE 050 | 08:08 | Shrine Grounds - Main Path
**Type:** Transition

The walk to school began—Tenchi's hand finding Sheldon's naturally, the contact established without discussion.

The village waited below. The day's responsibilities waited with it.
