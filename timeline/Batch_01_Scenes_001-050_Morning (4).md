# DAY 13 - APRIL 15, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-10:00)

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:02 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room, waking

Thirteen. The number arrived with consciousness, carrying cultural weight he'd learned to recognize. Western superstition's unlucky number, Japanese building floors that skipped it for different reasons.

His eyes opened to the familiar ceiling beam. Saturday waited.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:05 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Guest room

Saturday light was different—unhurried, permission granted for slower rising. The weekend had its own quality, perceptible even before fully waking. The shrine's rhythm adjusted for days without school obligations.

Tenchi would sleep late. The morning belonged to work.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:09 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Guest room

The flower project waited. Three different flowers, drawings required, Monday deadline. Tenchi's first real homework assignment that required more than practice—observation, selection, representation.

The shrine's gardens would provide. They always provided.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:13 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room, futon folding

The futon folded itself through his hands—automatic now, the sequence requiring no thought. Thirteen days had made this motion as natural as breathing. His body knew this task without his mind's participation.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:17 | Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Corridor

The hallway held Saturday's particular silence—deeper than weekday quiet, the absence of impending departure creating spaciousness. Sheldon walked toward the bathroom with steps that didn't need to hurry.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:21 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Bathroom

Cold water. Tooth powder. The morning rituals unchanged by the day's designation. Weekends didn't alter the body's needs, only the schedule for meeting them.

His reflection showed the changes thirteen days had wrought—sharper angles, harder planes, the architecture of a body reshaping itself for labor.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:26 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito was present as always, the old man's rhythms independent of calendar. Tea waited. The fire crackled. The pattern held regardless of what the week called this day.

"The gravel first," Katsuhito said. "Two loads before Tenchi wakes."

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:29 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

Sheldon accepted tea and the assignment in the same motion. Two loads before a child's waking—perhaps two hours of work, perhaps less as his efficiency improved.

"The path will be ready for visitors?"

"Nearly. Today's work should complete the base layer."

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:33 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

The base layer. Beneath what visitors would see, the foundation they'd never notice. The work that made the visible work possible. Maintenance existed mostly in invisible spaces.

His academic career had been the opposite—visible achievements, invisible rot.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:37 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"The flower project," Sheldon said. "After the gravel?"

"After the gravel. Tenchi should participate in choosing." Katsuhito's tone held something—amusement, perhaps. "He has opinions about flowers."

"He's four."

"Four-year-olds have the strongest opinions."

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:41 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen, quick breakfast

Breakfast was abbreviated—rice, soup, enough to fuel the morning's first efforts. Sheldon ate with practical attention, his body's needs taking precedence over appreciation.

Work waited. The gravel wouldn't carry itself.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:46 | Tool Shed - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tool shed

The wheelbarrow emerged from its place with the familiarity of thirteen days. Sheldon's hands knew this tool now—the grip angle, the balance point, the optimal posture for sustained carrying.

Tools became extensions. He was extending.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:51 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Shrine steps, descending

The descent to the gravel pile had become routine—each step predictable, the rhythm established, the body knowing before the mind directed. Sheldon let gravity assist while his thoughts wandered.

Saturday morning. Flower projects. A child waiting to wake.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:58 | Village - Shrine Base
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Shrine base

The gravel pile had diminished significantly. Sheldon assessed what remained—perhaps twenty loads, maybe fewer. Two days more of sustained effort would complete the transport.

The end was visible. Completion approached.

---

## SCENE 015 | 06:02 | Village - Shrine Base
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Shrine base, loading

First load of the day. The shovel bit into gravel, the sound familiar now—a particular frequency of metal meeting stone that he'd learned to anticipate.

Forty kilograms. The weight no longer surprised him.

---

## SCENE 016 | 06:06 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Shrine steps, ascending

The climb began. Step by step, the wheelbarrow's weight pulling backward, his body compensating through angles he'd discovered over thirteen days.

His muscles remembered. His lungs knew the demand.

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:13 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Shrine steps, lower section

The forest watched his passage—that sense of attention he'd learned to accept without analysis. Something noted his labor, his persistence, his becoming.

He climbed. The watcher didn't interfere.

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:20 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Shrine steps, middle section

Halfway point. Sheldon paused without setting down the wheelbarrow—the pause itself a measure of progress. Two weeks ago, this point would have required extended rest.

Now it required only a breath adjustment.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:26 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Shrine steps, upper section

The final push. His muscles operated beyond complaint now, in that territory where effort continued because stopping was more difficult than proceeding.

The southern path's gravel pile waited to receive another contribution.

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:32 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Southern path, depositing

First load deposited. The pile had grown substantial over three days' work—a visible mound of material that would become path, that would carry visitors, that would serve the shrine's purposes.

His labor made tangible.

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:36 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Shrine steps, descending

The descent was relief, as always. Empty wheelbarrow, gravity assisting, the body's respite from ascent's demands. Sheldon counted steps automatically—320, a number that had become as familiar as his own heartbeat.

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:43 | Village - Shrine Base
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Shrine base, second load

Second load. The rhythm established itself—shovel, fill, grip, climb, deposit, descend. The cycle that had been novel was now simply how Saturday mornings proceeded.

The gravel pile shrank by another forty kilograms.

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:47 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Shrine steps, ascending

The village was beginning to stir below—early risers, Saturday rhythms, the sounds of a community waking without urgency. Sheldon climbed above it all, ascending toward the shrine's quieter territories.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:54 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Shrine steps, reflecting

His academic colleagues were sleeping now, probably—or finishing late nights in their labs, or reviewing papers on laptop screens. A different world, operating on different rhythms.

He didn't miss it. The realization was complete and simple.

---

## SCENE 025 | 07:01 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Southern path, depositing

Second load deposited. The pile's growth was measurable—he could see yesterday's layer beneath today's additions. Stratification of effort, geology of labor.

Tenchi would be waking soon.

---

## SCENE 026 | 07:05 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Southern path

Katsuhito appeared with timing that suggested awareness beyond coincidence. The old man assessed the gravel pile, nodded once, and offered tea from the ceramic he carried.

"Two loads before breakfast. Good."

"The boy will be up soon."

---

## SCENE 027 | 07:09 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Southern path

"The flower project matters to him," Katsuhito said. "Not the homework itself—the doing of it. With you."

The observation landed precisely. Tenchi cared about the activity, not the assignment. The relationship, not the task.

---

## SCENE 028 | 07:13 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen, returning

They returned together to find Tenchi already present—the boy in pajamas, hair wild from sleep, eyes bright with Saturday's particular excitement.

"You're awake early," Sheldon said.

"It's flower day!"

---

## SCENE 029 | 07:16 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Flower day. The boy had renamed Saturday according to its primary purpose. The assignment had become an event, the homework transformed into adventure.

Children's perception shaped reality. This reality was acceptable.

---

## SCENE 030 | 07:20 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen, breakfast preparation

"Breakfast first," Sheldon said. "Then we find flowers."

"Three flowers," Tenchi confirmed. "Different kinds. The teacher said spring flowers are best."

"The shrine has spring flowers. Many kinds."

---

## SCENE 031 | 07:24 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

Breakfast expanded to accommodate Saturday's pace—rice, soup, pickles, plus grilled fish left from yesterday's catch. The meal was more substantial, the morning more leisurely.

Tenchi ate with impatient attention, fueling the adventure ahead.

---

## SCENE 032 | 07:30 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Which flowers will you choose?" Sheldon asked.

"I don't know yet. I have to see them first." The boy's logic was unassailable. Choice required options. Options required observation.

"Then we'll observe."

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:35 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"The cherry blossoms," Katsuhito suggested. "They're still blooming, but not for long."

"Cherry blossoms are pink," Tenchi said. "I want different colors."

"Colors are important for art." The old man's eyes held amusement. "What colors do you want?"

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:39 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

"Pink and yellow and... something else." Tenchi's planning was characteristic—partial certainty, room for discovery. He knew what he wanted without knowing everything.

Children trusted the unfolding. Adults calculated too much.

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:44 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Tenchi's room

The boy dressed with Saturday's freedom—no uniform required, the clothes of choice and comfort. Sheldon waited in the doorway, observing the small decisions that expressed the child's developing preferences.

"Ready?"

"Ready!"

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:48 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Garden entrance

The shrine's gardens spread across the eastern slope—a terraced arrangement of cultivated and semi-wild spaces that generations had tended. Sheldon had seen parts of this territory; much remained unexplored.

"Where do we start?"

Tenchi pointed toward a gate Sheldon hadn't noticed. "The special garden."

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:52 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Garden path

The special garden occupied a terrace below the main shrine complex—walled on three sides, open toward the valley view. The gate's paint had faded to suggestions of red, the wood worn smooth by countless hands.

Sheldon pushed it open and entered another world.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:55 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden, entrance

The garden held color in concentrated doses—flowers Sheldon couldn't name arranged in patterns that felt deliberate but not formal. A place designed for beauty rather than display.

"Grandma made this garden," Tenchi said quietly. "Before she went away."

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:58 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Special garden

Grandma. Kiyone. Tenchi's mother, who had made this garden before her death three years ago. The flowers that bloomed now were her legacy, the colors she had chosen, the patterns she had arranged.

"It's beautiful," Sheldon said.

"She liked flowers." The boy's voice was simple, matter-of-fact. Not grief exactly—acceptance.

---

## SCENE 040 | 08:02 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden

They walked the paths together—Tenchi leading, Sheldon following. The boy knew this garden intimately, could name plants Sheldon couldn't identify, could explain which flowers his mother had loved most.

"That one's called mountain violet. Grandma said it's shy."

---

## SCENE 041 | 08:06 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden, violet patch

The mountain violet was purple-blue, small, partially hidden beneath larger leaves. Shy seemed appropriate—the flower didn't announce itself but rewarded close attention.

"Is purple-blue one of your colors?"

Tenchi considered. "Maybe. Let me see the others first."

---

## SCENE 042 | 08:10 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Special garden

They moved deeper into the garden. Each section held different plantings—some flowering now, some holding buds for later bloom, some resting in green expectation.

Kiyone had planned for seasonal progression. The garden would change throughout the year.

---

## SCENE 043 | 08:14 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden, yellow flowers

Yellow appeared in a sunlit corner—narcissus, if Sheldon identified correctly. The flowers stood straight and confident, their color declaring presence rather than hiding it.

"Those are loud," Tenchi said. "Grandma called them trumpet flowers."

"Do you want a loud flower?"

---

## SCENE 044 | 08:18 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden

"One loud, one shy, one..." Tenchi paused, searching for the right word. "One surprised."

"Surprised?"

"A flower that looks surprised. You know."

Sheldon didn't know, but the category made emotional sense. Flowers had expressions. Children read them.

---

## SCENE 045 | 08:22 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Special garden, deeper section

They searched for a surprised flower. Sheldon didn't know what to look for, but Tenchi seemed confident in the hunt, examining each bloom with serious attention.

"That one's sleepy. That one's angry. That one's just sitting there."

---

## SCENE 046 | 08:26 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden, edge

Near the garden's edge, against the boundary wall, a camellia held late blooms—pink-white, partially open, the petals arranged in a pattern that did indeed suggest surprise.

"That one!" Tenchi's voice carried triumph. "See? Surprised!"

---

## SCENE 047 | 08:30 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden

Sheldon looked at the camellia and saw what Tenchi saw—or learned to see it. The flower's arrangement, the way the petals caught light, the expression that emerged when you stopped analyzing and simply looked.

"You're right. It does look surprised."

---

## SCENE 048 | 08:34 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden, reviewing choices

"Three flowers," Tenchi announced. "Purple-blue shy one, yellow loud one, pink surprised one."

The taxonomy was complete. The assignment had become something more—a lesson in perception, in Kiyone's garden, in a child's way of categorizing beauty.

---

## SCENE 049 | 08:38 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Special garden, heading back

"We need to draw them," Tenchi said. "Here, not inside. Grandma said flowers don't look the same away from their home."

Another piece of Kiyone's wisdom, transmitted through her son to Sheldon.

---

## SCENE 050 | 08:42 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Special garden, returning for supplies

"I'll get the drawing paper," Sheldon said. "You stay here and look at your flowers. Really look."

"I will." The boy settled onto the path, eyes fixed on the mountain violet. The assignment was becoming observation. The observation was becoming art.
