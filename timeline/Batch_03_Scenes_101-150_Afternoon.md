# DAY 15 - APRIL 17, 1989 (MONDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 3: Scenes 101-150 (11:42-16:00)

---

## SCENE 101 | 11:46 | Village (Main Street)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The village's main street ran roughly north-south, shops and houses arranged along its length without apparent pattern. Monday midday brought modest activity—housewives shopping, elderly men gathered outside the general store, the occasional delivery truck navigating the narrow lane.

Sheldon walked with studied casualness, not wanting to appear lost.

---

## SCENE 102 | 11:50 | Village (Main Street)
**Type:** Character Development

Two weeks of village exposure had familiarized him with the layout's logic. General store at the central intersection. Fish market toward the southern end. The elementary school to the east, set back from the road.

Yamada's workshop, according to Katsuhito's directions, occupied the western edge. Near the old well.

---

## SCENE 103 | 11:54 | Village (Western Road)
**Type:** Transition

He turned onto the side road that led west. Smaller here—residential gates, kitchen gardens, the sounds of domestic life filtering through hedges. A dog barked once, then fell silent.

The old well should be visible soon. A stone structure, Katsuhito had said. Unused but maintained.

---

## SCENE 104 | 11:58 | Village (Near Old Well)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The well appeared around a gentle curve—exactly as described. Circular stone wall, wooden roof, bucket hung for tradition more than function. Modern plumbing had made it decorative, but someone still tended the rope and cleaned the rim.

Beyond it, a larger building with sawdust smell drifting from open doors.

---

## SCENE 105 | 12:02 | Yamada's Workshop (Exterior)
**Type:** Main Plot

The workshop announced itself through senses before signs: the smell of cut wood, the intermittent rasp of sawing, stacked lumber visible through the entrance.

A weathered sign bore the name 山田工房—Yamada Workshop. Traditional characters, hand-painted. The establishment had history.

---

## SCENE 106 | 12:06 | Yamada's Workshop (Entrance)
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon paused at the threshold. The etiquette here wasn't something his education had covered.

"Sumimasen," he called into the interior. The universal Japanese introduction: excuse me, I'm imposing, please acknowledge my existence.

Sawing stopped.

---

## SCENE 107 | 12:10 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

A man emerged from between stacked lumber—fifties, perhaps sixties, with the build of someone who'd spent decades lifting wood. Gray hair cropped short. Eyes that assessed before welcoming.

"Yes?" In Japanese, neutral.

"I'm told you repair carts. And teach those who want to learn."

---

## SCENE 108 | 12:14 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Relationship

Yamada's expression shifted at the phrasing—recognition of something in the approach.

"Masaki-sensei sent you."

"He suggested I ask."

"Asking is the first step." Yamada gestured toward a workbench. "Show me your hands."

---

## SCENE 109 | 12:18 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon extended his hands, palms up. The calluses from wheelbarrow work. The nicks and small scars of gravel handling. Hands that had changed over two weeks.

Yamada examined without touching, reading the surfaces like text.

"Recent work. You weren't always a laborer."

"No."

---

## SCENE 110 | 12:22 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Relationship

"What were you?" The question direct, without judgment.

"A scholar. Physics. In America."

Yamada's eyebrows rose fractionally—the only acknowledgment of surprise.

"Physics." He repeated the word as if tasting it. "And now you want to learn carpentry."

"I want to repair a cart. What I learn beyond that is what you're willing to teach."

---

## SCENE 111 | 12:26 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The workshop's interior organized itself as Sheldon's eyes adjusted. Hand tools on walls, each in its designated place. Power tools on one workbench, hand tools on another. The logic was functional, prioritizing access over aesthetics.

A half-finished cabinet stood on sawhorses—current project, judging by the fresh shavings around it.

---

## SCENE 112 | 12:30 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

"Tell me about this cart," Yamada said. He moved to the half-finished cabinet, resuming work as if the conversation were secondary.

Sheldon described what he'd found: the damaged wheel, the split handle, the overall structure that seemed sound despite years of neglect.

Yamada listened while his hands shaped wood.

---

## SCENE 113 | 12:34 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

Describing the cart's problems revealed how little Sheldon actually knew. He had observations but lacked vocabulary—the technical terms that would let him communicate precisely.

"Spokes," he said, reaching for the word. "Two or three are cracked."

"Cracked or split?"

The distinction mattered. He didn't know the difference.

---

## SCENE 114 | 12:38 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Relationship

Yamada set down his plane and crossed to a wall where wheel components hung.

"Cracked." He pointed to a spoke with a hairline fracture. "Weakened but intact. Split." A spoke clearly broken in two. "Failed completely."

"Cracked, then. I think."

"You'll need to look again. With better words."

---

## SCENE 115 | 12:42 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

Better words. The phrase lodged in Sheldon's mind.

He'd spent his academic career acquiring precise vocabulary—mathematical notation, physical constants, the specialized language of theoretical physics. This was the same process applied to different material.

Learning began with naming.

---

## SCENE 116 | 12:46 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

"Bring the wheel here," Yamada said. "Not the whole cart. Just the damaged wheel. I'll look. Then we discuss."

"I can remove the wheel myself?"

"If you can't, you're not ready to repair it."

The test was built into the instruction. Sheldon appreciated the efficiency.

---

## SCENE 117 | 12:50 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Yamada returned to his cabinet, the conversation apparently complete. But Sheldon sensed he was meant to stay—to observe, to absorb through presence rather than explicit teaching.

He found an unobtrusive position near the wall and watched.

---

## SCENE 118 | 12:54 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

The carpenter's movements were economical in the way Katsuhito's were—nothing wasted, each action flowing into the next. The plane glided across wood, removing shavings in consistent curls.

Sheldon had never watched craftsmanship at this level. The closest analogy was watching a colleague derive equations—expertise made visible through execution.

---

## SCENE 119 | 12:58 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Physics and carpentry. Both required understanding materials at a fundamental level—how they behaved under stress, how they could be shaped without breaking.

The connection wasn't metaphor. It was structural similarity. He'd spent years studying forces; now he would study their application in wood.

---

## SCENE 120 | 13:02 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

A woman appeared in the workshop's back doorway—Yamada's wife, presumably, carrying a tray with tea.

"You have a visitor," she observed. Not surprise, but acknowledgment.

"The shrine's foreigner. He wants to learn."

"Ah." She set the tray on a clear workbench. "Tea, then."

---

## SCENE 121 | 13:06 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Relationship

Tea offered and accepted. The woman—Yamada's wife introduced herself as Fumiko, same characters as Sheldon's mother's name but different tones—poured with practiced grace.

"From the shrine," she said. "Masaki-sensei mentioned you might visit."

The village network had already communicated his arrival. Small communities held few secrets.

---

## SCENE 122 | 13:10 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

The tea was green, slightly bitter, exactly what he needed after the morning's exertion. Sheldon drank and watched, the combination of observation and refreshment creating a space for learning without pressure.

Yamada worked. His wife tidied. Sheldon absorbed.

---

## SCENE 123 | 13:14 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

"The wheel," Yamada said without looking up. "If it's oak, the spokes may be salvageable. Plane the fractures, reinforce with pegs. If it's softer wood, replacement is easier than repair."

"How do I identify the wood?"

"Bring it. I'll show you."

---

## SCENE 124 | 13:18 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The workshop's shelves held sample pieces—different woods labeled in careful handwriting. Oak, cedar, cypress, pine. Hardwoods and softwoods. Local species and imports.

Sheldon studied the samples, trying to memorize grain patterns and colors. Visual vocabulary to complement the verbal.

---

## SCENE 125 | 13:22 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

The learning was happening through immersion, not instruction. No textbook, no lecture. Just presence in a space where knowledge lived in the hands of someone willing to demonstrate.

Different from any education he'd experienced. More demanding in its patience.

---

## SCENE 126 | 13:26 | Yamada's Workshop (Interior)
**Type:** Relationship

"Tomorrow," Yamada said. "Bring the wheel in the morning. Before nine, I work alone. After nine, I teach."

"I understand."

"The shrine's work comes first. Masaki-sensei needs you more than I do."

The hierarchy was clear. Sheldon's obligations ordered themselves accordingly.

---

## SCENE 127 | 13:30 | Yamada's Workshop (Exterior)
**Type:** Transition

He thanked Yamada and his wife, bowing in the manner he'd observed locals use—deeper for the teacher, slightly less for his spouse.

The gestures were becoming more natural. Still conscious, but no longer awkward.

---

## SCENE 128 | 13:34 | Village (Western Road)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Walking back through the village, Sheldon processed the encounter. A door had opened—not widely, but enough to see through.

Tomorrow he'd bring the wheel. The next step in a process that might take weeks to complete.

Patience as curriculum.

---

## SCENE 129 | 13:38 | Village (Main Street)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Midday lull settling over the village. The lunch hour had drawn people indoors, leaving streets quieter than morning.

Sheldon passed the general store, the fish market, the small restaurant whose owner had begun nodding at him in recognition.

Integration measured in nods and the absence of stares.

---

## SCENE 130 | 13:42 | Village (Main Street)
**Type:** Character Development

His stomach reminded him that breakfast had been hours ago. The restaurant's menu was a mystery—handwritten characters he couldn't fully parse—but the smells promised satisfaction.

He hesitated at the entrance. Eating alone in a public place still felt exposed.

---

## SCENE 131 | 13:46 | Village Restaurant (Entrance)
**Type:** Main Plot

A decision. He pushed open the door.

Inside: four tables, a counter with stools, an elderly woman who looked up from her work with mild surprise.

"Irasshaimase," she said. The universal welcome. "One?"

"One."

---

## SCENE 132 | 13:50 | Village Restaurant (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The restaurant was called 松本食堂—Matsumoto Shokudō. Simple fare, the kind that sustained working people. The menu board listed set meals with prices that made Sheldon blink. Cheap by any standard he knew.

He pointed at a lunch set featuring fish. The woman nodded approvingly.

---

## SCENE 133 | 13:54 | Village Restaurant (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

Waiting for food, Sheldon examined the restaurant's interior. Family photographs on one wall. A calendar with a shrine's blessing printed above the dates. The television in the corner showing a baseball game, sound muted.

A working-class establishment that welcomed whoever walked in.

---

## SCENE 134 | 13:58 | Village Restaurant (Interior)
**Type:** Relationship

"From the shrine?" the woman asked from behind the counter.

"Yes."

"Masaki-sensei's guest."

"Guest" was generous. Worker, more accurately. But he didn't correct her.

"He's a good man. Good priest."

"He is."

---

## SCENE 135 | 14:02 | Village Restaurant (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

The lunch arrived: grilled fish, rice, pickles, miso soup, a small salad. Arranged with care despite the modest price.

Sheldon ate with the appreciation of someone who'd learned not to take meals for granted. The fish was local, the woman said. Her husband caught it that morning.

---

## SCENE 136 | 14:06 | Village Restaurant (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Other diners entered as he ate—two construction workers in dusty clothing, a delivery driver grabbing a quick meal. The woman greeted each by name, knew their orders without asking.

Village as extended family. Everyone's habits known, accommodated, woven into daily function.

---

## SCENE 137 | 14:10 | Village Restaurant (Interior)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The food settled his stomach and clarified his thinking. A productive morning: gravel work, cart assessment, connection with Yamada.

The afternoon stretched ahead. He should return to the shrine, but one more task called.

The Tsukino house. His house. Just a look from the road.

---

## SCENE 138 | 14:14 | Village Restaurant (Exterior)
**Type:** Transition

He paid and thanked the woman—Matsumoto-san, she said, call me that—and stepped back into the afternoon.

The village paths were becoming familiar. East toward the shrine steps, or southeast toward the slope where the Tsukino house waited.

Southeast.

---

## SCENE 139 | 14:18 | Village (Eastern Road)
**Type:** Character Development

The walk was becoming pilgrimage. Second visit in two days, though he wouldn't enter this time.

Just observe. See the house in afternoon light. Continue building the mental map that would guide eventual renovation.

---

## SCENE 140 | 14:22 | Village (Eastern Slope Path)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The path climbed gently, passing cultivated plots and older homes. This edge of the village felt more settled, families who'd lived here for generations.

The Tsukino property waited above, separated from neighbors by enough distance to suggest different social standing.

---

## SCENE 141 | 14:26 | Tsukino House (Exterior - Road View)
**Type:** Main Plot

There. The house appeared through a gap in roadside vegetation—roof tiles visible first, then walls, then the overgrown garden surrounding.

From this angle, the structure looked smaller than memory had made it. Human-scaled problems.

---

## SCENE 142 | 14:30 | Tsukino House (Exterior - Road View)
**Type:** Character Development

He stopped on the road, not entering the property. Just looking.

The roof showed its age clearly in this light—tiles displaced, moss establishing colonies in the joins. Work for a professional, probably. Unless he learned enough from Yamada to attempt it himself.

---

## SCENE 143 | 14:34 | Tsukino House (Exterior - Road View)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

His house. The phrase was settling into something that felt less borrowed.

The structure had stood for generations. It could stand long enough for him to learn what it needed.

Patience. The lesson repeated itself in every context.

---

## SCENE 144 | 14:38 | Village (Eastern Slope Path)
**Type:** Transition

He turned back toward the village center. The shrine steps waited, and Katsuhito might have tasks for the afternoon's remaining hours.

The cart wheel needed removing. Tomorrow's appointment with Yamada required preparation.

---

## SCENE 145 | 14:42 | Village (Main Street)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Passing through the village again, Sheldon noticed details he'd missed in the morning: the particular shade of blue on a shuttered window, the way shadows fell across the narrow lanes, a child's bicycle leaned against a fence.

The eye learned to see more when given time.

---

## SCENE 146 | 14:46 | Shrine Steps (Base)
**Type:** Character Development

The 320 steps rose before him—familiar now, but no less demanding. His body remembered the ascent even as his muscles protested the prospect.

He began climbing. One step at a time. The same approach that applied to everything else.

---

## SCENE 147 | 14:50 | Shrine Steps (Lower Section)
**Type:** Main Plot

The repaired section looked solid even from above. His work, holding.

The satisfaction accompanied him upward, each step a small confirmation that he could make things better through effort.

---

## SCENE 148 | 14:54 | Shrine Steps (Middle Section)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Afternoon visitors descending passed him on the steps—a family with young children, moving carefully on the ancient stones.

One child pointed at Sheldon and said something in rapid Japanese. The mother shushed him, but smiled apologetically.

Foreigners remained remarkable, apparently.

---

## SCENE 149 | 14:58 | Shrine Steps (Upper Section)
**Type:** Transition

The compound appeared above the final flight. Home—or the closest thing to it that he currently had.

Sheldon climbed the last steps with the relief of arrival, his body knowing it had earned rest.

---

## SCENE 150 | 15:02 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The afternoon sun warmed the compound, casting long shadows from the torii gates. Peaceful in a way that required adjustment every time he returned.

The cart wheel. That was next. Remove it, prepare it for tomorrow.

The work continued.
