# DAY 17 - APRIL 19, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 3: Scenes 101-150 (11:38-15:30)
## **Solo Work at Tsukino House - Afternoon Session**

---

## SCENE 101 | 11:38 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Post-lunch energy required direction. The wall repair waited for materials; the floor repair waited for timber; the engawa repair waited for replacement boards.

What remained achievable today?

---

## SCENE 102 | 11:42 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

The assessment list offered options: cleaning continued, further investigation of problem areas, preparation work that would accelerate future repairs.

He chose preparation. Groundwork today would enable construction tomorrow.

---

## SCENE 103 | 11:46 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Transition

The second room's tatami—unsalvageable, he'd determined—could be removed. The action would serve multiple purposes: eliminating degraded material, exposing the subfloor for inspection, preparing the space for eventual replacement.

He began the removal.

---

## SCENE 104 | 11:50 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Tatami were heavier than expected—each mat weighing significantly despite its degraded state. The removal required leverage and persistence.

First mat out, revealing flooring beneath.

---

## SCENE 105 | 11:54 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The exposed floor showed the water damage's full extent. Staining traced the failure's history—multiple rain events, each depositing minerals, each expanding the damage zone.

Years of accumulated neglect, mapped in discoloration.

---

## SCENE 106 | 11:58 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Character Development

He worked methodically, removing each mat, stacking them outside for eventual disposal. The physical labor generated warmth despite the room's cool air.

His body had adapted to this kind of work. Three weeks had changed more than routines.

---

## SCENE 107 | 12:02 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Subplot

Second mat revealed more damage—a section where the floor boards had warped, pulling away from their supporting joists.

Another repair item. The list continued its growth.

---

## SCENE 108 | 12:06 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Third and fourth mats removed. The room's full floor condition became visible—worse near the window where water entry had been most direct, better toward the interior.

Triage zones. Some boards salvageable, others requiring replacement.

---

## SCENE 109 | 12:10 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The damage pattern told a story: roof failure starting gradually, then accelerating. Early rain events had been absorbed; later ones had overwhelmed the structure's capacity.

Deferred maintenance always came due. The house was presenting its accumulated bill.

---

## SCENE 110 | 12:14 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The final tatami revealed the worst damage—directly beneath the window, where water had pooled before draining. The boards here had rotted completely through.

He could see the crawl space beneath through the gaps.

---

## SCENE 111 | 12:18 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Character Development

Seeing the full scope clarified rather than discouraged. Known problems could be planned for. Unknown problems generated anxiety.

He now knew what this room required. The knowledge was its own form of progress.

---

## SCENE 112 | 12:22 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Transition

The removed tatami needed storage until disposal could be arranged. He carried them to a sheltered spot behind the outbuilding.

Stacking to allow air circulation, preventing further mold development.

---

## SCENE 113 | 12:26 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

From outside, he examined the roof above the damaged room. The problem was visible now that he knew where to look—tiles displaced, one section clearly compromised.

Yamada's assessment couldn't come soon enough.

---

## SCENE 114 | 12:30 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Japanese roof construction: ceramic tiles overlapping in specific patterns, supported by battens attached to rafters. The system worked when complete, failed when components displaced.

The displaced tiles had created a gap. Water had found the gap. Everything downstream had suffered.

---

## SCENE 115 | 12:34 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Subplot

He couldn't repair the roof himself—the work required specialized knowledge, specialized equipment, and the particular fearlessness of someone comfortable at height.

But he could document the damage for professional assessment.

---

## SCENE 116 | 12:38 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Character Development

Notes added to his growing list: roof damage location, approximate extent, visible displaced tiles. Information for Yamada or whoever the carpenter recommended.

Preparation for the conversation he'd need to have.

---

## SCENE 117 | 12:42 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Transition

The afternoon had warmed, April sun asserting itself through the forest canopy. He paused in the garden, allowing the day's work to settle.

The spirit house caught his attention again.

---

## SCENE 118 | 12:46 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

He approached the small structure, examining it more carefully than morning's quick survey had allowed.

Traditional construction on miniature scale: tiny posts, tiny roof, tiny doors. A house for spirits, built with the care of a house for people.

---

## SCENE 119 | 12:50 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The offerings inside had long since decomposed—rice, sake, whatever else had been placed for the property's protective spirits.

The neglect troubled him in ways he couldn't fully articulate.

---

## SCENE 120 | 12:54 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

He didn't believe in spirits—not exactly, not in the way traditional observance required.

But the absence of offerings felt like broken promise. Someone had made commitments to the unseen. Those commitments had been abandoned.

---

## SCENE 121 | 12:58 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Character Development

Perhaps belief wasn't the point. Perhaps the practice was about respect—for tradition, for those who came before, for the continuity of care that houses represented.

He could offer respect without requiring faith.

---

## SCENE 122 | 13:02 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

He returned inside, finding rice, finding water. A small portion measured and cooked—not for himself but for an offering.

The ritual felt awkward and right simultaneously.

---

## SCENE 123 | 13:06 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

While the rice cooked, he cleaned the spirit house as best he could without proper knowledge. Debris removed, surfaces wiped, the small space made presentable.

Better than abandonment. Less than proper restoration.

---

## SCENE 124 | 13:10 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The offering placed: small bowl of cooked rice, positioned as he'd seen at other shrines. No prayer—he didn't know what to say—but a moment of acknowledged presence.

"I'm here now," he said to the empty air. "I'll try to do this properly."

---

## SCENE 125 | 13:14 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The words surprised him. Speaking to spirits he didn't believe in, making promises he wasn't sure he could keep.

But the speaking had felt necessary. The property deserved acknowledgment.

---

## SCENE 126 | 13:18 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Character Development

He'd ask Katsuhito about proper protocol. The priest would know what offerings were appropriate, what words should be spoken, what calendar of observance applied.

Learning another system. The mountain continued its education.

---

## SCENE 127 | 13:22 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Transition

Back to practical work. The spiritual could wait for guidance; the physical demanded immediate attention.

The wall panel repair: he could prepare the repair site even without replacement material.

---

## SCENE 128 | 13:26 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

The damaged frame section—measurements taken, rot removed, surfaces prepared. The new timber would need to match existing dimensions precisely.

He created a template from cardboard scraps, capturing the profile for matching.

---

## SCENE 129 | 13:30 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Template making required attention to subtle details—the particular angles where members met, the curves of aged wood, the way original construction had accommodated natural material variation.

Precision in documentation enabled precision in execution.

---

## SCENE 130 | 13:34 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

His drafting instincts—inherited from the physics background, perhaps—served the carpentry well. Accurate representation preceded accurate construction.

Different domains, overlapping methods. The pattern repeated.

---

## SCENE 131 | 13:38 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot

The template complete, he examined the wall panel itself. The wood was sound despite age—cypress, probably, chosen for durability.

With the frame repaired, the panel could return to service. Another fifty years, perhaps.

---

## SCENE 132 | 13:42 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Transition

The afternoon had passed midpoint. He moved to exterior work, the engawa boards providing opportunity for preparation if not completion.

The dangerous board could be removed entirely, eliminating hazard while awaiting replacement.

---

## SCENE 133 | 13:46 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Main Plot

The removal required care—the board was nailed, and the nails had corroded into the framing. Pry bar applied with patience, leverage working gradually.

The board surrendered piece by piece.

---

## SCENE 134 | 13:50 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The underlying structure was sound—the rot hadn't penetrated to the joists. Good news: the repair would be simpler than feared.

Board replacement rather than structural repair. Materials needed, but not expertise.

---

## SCENE 135 | 13:54 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Character Development

He measured the gap left by the removed board, noting dimensions for the replacement. Width, length, thickness—each specification captured.

The village lumber supplier could cut to size, or he could acquire rough material and dimension it himself.

---

## SCENE 136 | 13:58 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The option to do the work himself appealed more than convenience suggested it should.

There was satisfaction in complete creation—from raw material to finished product. The satisfaction exceeded the convenience of purchasing finished goods.

---

## SCENE 137 | 14:02 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Transition

The garden's overgrowth called to him, its disorder contrasting with the house's emerging order.

He couldn't tackle the full restoration, but selective clearing would improve access and aesthetics.

---

## SCENE 138 | 14:06 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Garden tools retrieved from the shed: pruning shears, hand saw, the small cultivator. Equipment for modest intervention.

He began with the paths—clearing enough growth to walk comfortably between house and garden elements.

---

## SCENE 139 | 14:10 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The stepping stones emerged from beneath vegetation, their placement confirming the garden's intentional design. A circuit existed, connecting entrance to spirit house to seating area to exit.

The designer had planned for contemplative walking.

---

## SCENE 140 | 14:14 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Subplot

The seating area: a flat stone positioned to view the garden's focal point, which appeared to be a rock arrangement now half-hidden by growth.

He cleared enough to reveal the stones—three, of varying sizes, positioned in traditional groupings.

---

## SCENE 141 | 14:18 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Character Development

The rock arrangement had meaning he didn't fully understand—something about mountains, water, the relationship between elements.

Another topic for Katsuhito. The priest's knowledge extended beyond spiritual matters.

---

## SCENE 142 | 14:22 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The clearing proceeded: overgrown branches trimmed, invasive growth removed, the garden's bones gradually revealed.

Each cut exposed more of the original design—elegant in conception, patient in execution.

---

## SCENE 143 | 14:26 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Restoration rather than creation. He wasn't designing a garden; he was uncovering one.

The distinction mattered. The original designer's vision deserved respect, not replacement.

---

## SCENE 144 | 14:30 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The vegetation removed went to a pile behind the outbuilding—compost material, eventually. Nothing wasted if properly managed.

The garden could feed itself through its own debris.

---

## SCENE 145 | 14:34 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Transition

Physical fatigue accumulated through the afternoon's work—the pleasant exhaustion of productive effort.

He paused, surveying what the day had accomplished.

---

## SCENE 146 | 14:38 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Character Development

Progress visible everywhere: cleared paths, exposed stones, the spirit house now accessible rather than hidden.

The garden wouldn't be complete for months. But it was better than it had been this morning.

---

## SCENE 147 | 14:42 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

The afternoon had turned late. He should return to the shrine soon—dinner preparation required attention, and the household would wonder at his absence.

But the day's solitude had been valuable. He'd needed this focused work.

---

## SCENE 148 | 14:46 | Tsukino House - Interior
**Type:** Subplot

Final walk-through: the main room cleaner, the second room emptied of tatami, the kitchen functional, the wall prepared for repair.

The house was better for his attention. The progress was measurable.

---

## SCENE 149 | 14:50 | Tsukino House - Interior
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Seventeen days in this new life, and he was rebuilding a house.

The metaphor was too obvious. He noted it anyway.

---

## SCENE 150 | 14:54 | Tsukino House - Genkan
**Type:** Transition

Shoes changed, work clothes adjusted. He'd return tomorrow if the shrine's schedule allowed, continue the work that would eventually make this house fully habitable.

For now: the walk back, the evening's routine, the household that waited.

---
