# DAY 2 - APRIL 4, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-10:00)

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:03 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room, east wing

The second morning came with the same disorientation as the first. Sheldon opened his eyes to darkness, the ceiling beams barely visible in the pre-dawn glow filtering through paper screens. His body ached in places he hadn't known could ache. His shoulders. His lower back. The muscles running along his forearms.

He lay still, cataloging the sensations. The futon beneath him was thicker than any Western mattress he'd slept on, yet his hip bones still pressed against the tatami floor beneath. He shifted, and his neck protested—the buckwheat pillow had migrated during the night, leaving him at an awkward angle.

Two years old, this body. The system or the presence or whatever had brought him here had given him that much: a form that matched his mental age. Thirty-seven, plus two. He'd stopped trying to do that mathematics.

Sheldon sat up. The room resolved into shapes as his eyes adjusted. The low writing desk against the wall. The folded yukata he'd worn yesterday, draped over a wooden stand. The closed fusuma screens separating his space from the hallway.

He reached for his glasses on instinct and found nothing. He'd worn glasses for twenty years. His hand returned empty.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:08 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room, east wing

The futon resisted being folded. Sheldon had watched Katsuhito demonstrate this yesterday—three precise movements, the bedding compacted into a neat bundle for storage in the wall cupboard. His version looked like a fabric avalanche waiting to happen.

He tried again. Folded the bottom third up, then the top third down. The whole thing listed to the left. He straightened it, and it listed right.

His hands found a rhythm on the fourth attempt. The cotton batting settled into place. He lifted the bundle—heavier than expected—and slid it into the oshiire closet. The doors required specific pressure to close: firm at the top, gentle at the bottom, or they caught against the track.

Small victories. He'd take them.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:12 | Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** East wing corridor

The hallway was cold. Sheldon's bare feet registered the temperature change immediately—the tatami's texture giving way to polished wood that had spent the night losing heat to April air.

He padded toward the bathroom, one hand trailing along the wall for guidance. The shrine was larger than he'd realized yesterday, or perhaps his exhaustion had compressed distances. This corridor alone stretched past four closed screens before reaching the turn toward the main house.

Light seeped from beneath one doorway. A golden line on dark wood.

Sheldon slowed. Katsuhito. The old priest apparently needed very little sleep. He'd been awake when Sheldon finally surrendered to exhaustion last night, still awake now before dawn properly arrived.

He moved past the lit room without pausing. Questions could wait. His bladder could not.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:16 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** East wing bathroom

The bathroom announced itself by smell before he found the door. Cedar. Clean and sharp, different from the aged wood scent of the hallways.

Inside, the toilet was not a toilet. Not as he understood the word.

Sheldon stood before the porcelain fixture set into the floor, processing the geometry. A trough, essentially. Elongated, with a hood at one end indicating the proper orientation. He'd used one of these yesterday—poorly—but the mechanics remained foreign to the proprioception his body had learned elsewhere.

He positioned his feet on the textured panels flanking the opening. Adjusted his stance. The yukata he'd slept in required gathering and holding, a negotiation of fabric and balance that would have been comic if anyone were watching.

No one was watching.

He finished. Located the flush lever on the wall tank. Water rushed through the system with a force that startled him, even expecting it.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:21 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** East wing bathroom

The sink was a wooden barrel, half-filled with water that was not quite cold. A metal ladle hung from a hook beside it. Sheldon lifted the ladle, brought water to his face, and flinched at the temperature.

His reflection looked back from a small mirror mounted above the barrel. Dark hair. Hazel eyes. A face that was almost familiar but belonged to no photographs he could remember, no driver's license, no faculty ID.

He studied his features the way he might study an equation. The proportions were his—he recognized the line of his jaw, the spacing between his eyes. But something had shifted in the translation. A softening he couldn't quantify.

The water dripped from his chin. He ladled more, scrubbing his face until the cold became ordinary.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:25 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** East wing bathroom

The toothbrush on the shelf was new. Katsuhito had provided it yesterday, along with a tin of tooth powder that tasted of salt and chalk. Sheldon dipped the brush in water, tapped it into the powder, and worked through the motions.

His teeth felt clean for approximately thirty seconds before the unfamiliar taste reasserted itself. He rinsed with the ladle, spat into a wooden basin that drained somewhere beneath the floor.

Japanese plumbing. He'd read about this during graduate school, a tangent from his research that had seemed useless at the time. The watershed systems. The attention to water flow. The deliberate separation of clean and waste.

Now he stood inside that theory, watching his spit circle into darkness.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:29 | East Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** East wing corridor

Sheldon returned to his room for clothing. The yukata wouldn't serve for another day of work—too loose, too prone to catching on corners and handles. Yesterday's borrowed clothes waited where he'd folded them: cotton work pants, a long-sleeved shirt patched at both elbows, a vest that might have been fashionable forty years ago.

He dressed in layers. The cold had teeth this early in the morning, even inside.

The shirt buttons fought him. His fingers, still stiff from sleep, missed the buttonholes twice before finding purchase. He'd need to ask about gloves. Or learn to work faster than the cold could settle into his joints.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:34 | East Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** East wing corridor

Footsteps sounded from somewhere deeper in the house. Small footsteps, moving quickly.

Sheldon paused in the hallway, listening. The sound stopped. Started again, accompanied by a muffled voice. Tenchi, awake before the sun. The boy seemed to run on some internal battery that never fully depleted.

A door slid open, then closed. The footsteps retreated toward the main house.

Sheldon continued his own path toward the kitchen. He and Tenchi would cross paths eventually—the shrine wasn't large enough for avoidance—but he'd learned yesterday that mornings were simpler when the boy had Katsuhito's undivided attention. Simpler for all of them.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:38 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main house kitchen

The kitchen was already alive. Not with people—Sheldon entered alone—but with the residual evidence of Katsuhito's earlier passage. A kettle sat on the iron stove, steam curling from its spout. A bowl of rice rested on the counter, covered with a damp cloth. The fire in the stove had been banked but not extinguished.

Sheldon approached the stove carefully. The cast iron surface radiated heat in uneven waves. He located a cloth folded on the nearby shelf and used it to lift the kettle's lid. Water bubbled inside, not quite boiling.

Tea, then. He'd watched Katsuhito prepare it yesterday—leaves in a ceramic pot, water poured in a specific motion, a waiting period he hadn't bothered to time. He could approximate that. Probably.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:42 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main house kitchen

The tea canister was labeled in characters he couldn't read. Sheldon lifted it, smelled the contents. Green and vegetal, different from the black tea of his previous life but recognizable as tea.

He measured leaves into the pot using a small wooden scoop. The amount looked right. Or close to right. Katsuhito's portions had been generous, and the old man's hands moved with decades of practice Sheldon couldn't hope to match.

The kettle had quieted. He lifted it—heavy, heavier than expected—and poured water over the leaves. A few drops escaped, sizzling against the stove's surface.

Now he waited.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:46 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Waiting gave his mind time to wander. Not productively—his thoughts circled the same territory they'd circled yesterday and the day before.

The presence. The white figure. The sensation of being undone and reconstructed, which his conscious mind refused to store as memory but his body remembered as cellular-level terror.

Sheldon pressed his palms against the kitchen counter. Solid wood. Actual grain beneath his fingertips. He counted the knots in a three-foot section. Fourteen. One darker than the others, almost black at its center.

The tea had steeped long enough. He wasn't sure how he knew that, but his hand was already reaching for the pot.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:50 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main house kitchen

He poured into the cup Katsuhito had designated as his yesterday. A small thing, barely large enough for his hands, but the ceramic was warm and that warmth spread through his fingers and into his wrists.

The tea tasted different than yesterday's. Bitter at the edges, a sharpness that suggested he'd left the leaves too long. Or used too many. Or poured the water at the wrong temperature.

Sheldon drank it anyway. The bitterness was information. He could adjust tomorrow.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:55 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main house kitchen

The covered rice bowl drew his attention. He lifted the cloth, revealing white grain still slightly warm. Katsuhito must have cooked this within the hour.

Sheldon studied the rice. In his former life, rice had been a occasional side dish, something that came in boxes with packets of seasoning. This rice was different. Individual grains held their shape, slightly sticky, shining with absorbed water.

He located a rice paddle in a ceramic holder by the stove. Pressed its edge into the rice. The texture resisted, then yielded.

Somewhere in the house, a door opened. Voices—Katsuhito's measured bass, Tenchi's bright chatter—filtered through the walls.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:59 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Tenchi burst through the kitchen door like a small explosion. The boy saw Sheldon and stopped so abruptly he nearly tripped.

"Sheldon-san." Tenchi blinked at him. "You're awake."

"I am."

"Grandpa says you sleep like a bear in winter."

"Your grandfather has opinions."

Tenchi grinned at this. Whatever Sheldon had said, the boy interpreted it as conspiracy rather than criticism. He darted to the counter, standing on tiptoe to peer at the rice bowl.

"Is that for breakfast? I'm hungry. Grandpa says breakfast makes strong bones. I want to have the strongest bones in class."

---

## SCENE 015 | 06:02 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Katsuhito appeared in the doorway, moving with that unsettling silence that contradicted his apparent age. He assessed the scene—Sheldon with his bitter tea, Tenchi vibrating with morning energy, the rice cooling under its cloth—and made some internal calculation.

"Tenchi." His voice carried without rising. "Your clothes are not on your body."

Sheldon looked at the boy. Tenchi wore a sleeping robe, loosely tied, one shoulder exposed. No socks. No apparent awareness that this might be unusual.

"But I'm hungry."

"You will be dressed before you eat. This is not negotiable."

Tenchi's protest died before it fully formed. He recognized the tone. With one last longing look at the rice, he retreated toward his room.

---

## SCENE 016 | 06:05 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main house kitchen

"You made tea." Katsuhito moved to the stove, examined the kettle. "The leaves are still in the pot."

Sheldon looked at the ceramic teapot. He hadn't removed the leaves after pouring. "I didn't know—"

"They continue to steep. The tea grows bitter."

"I noticed."

Katsuhito's expression didn't shift, but something in his posture suggested amusement. He retrieved a small strainer from a hook above the stove and demonstrated the proper method: leaves out, liquid transferred to a fresh vessel, the pot rinsed for reuse.

"The same leaves serve for three pourings. Each stronger than the last."

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:09 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main house kitchen

"Today we repair the north fence." Katsuhito assembled breakfast with efficient motions. Rice into bowls. Pickled vegetables onto small plates. Miso soup from a pot Sheldon hadn't noticed, ladled into lacquer bowls that clicked softly when set on the wooden counter.

"The fence near the storage shed?"

"The same. Wind damage from winter. I have delayed the repair too long."

Sheldon accepted the bowl Katsuhito handed him. The rice looked identical to what he'd examined moments ago, but the presentation transformed it. A slight hollow in the center, a single pickled plum placed at the summit.

"I watched you work yesterday," Katsuhito continued. "Your hands learn quickly."

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:13 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main house kitchen

The compliment landed strangely. Sheldon turned the bowl in his hands, the lacquer smooth against his palms.

"I've never worked with wood before."

"Your body has not. Your understanding has." Katsuhito lifted his own bowl, inhaling the steam. "You see how pieces connect. How force transfers through joints. This is not common in beginners."

Tenchi's footsteps announced his return before the boy appeared, dressed now in kindergarten uniform: navy shorts, white shirt, a yellow cap clutched in one fist.

"I'm ready! Can I eat now?"

The morning lurched into its next phase.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:18 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Breakfast was a lesson in velocity. Tenchi ate like the food might escape. Rice disappeared in three-bite portions, miso soup gulped despite its temperature, pickles crunched with apparent disregard for their intended purpose as palate cleansers.

Sheldon ate slowly. Each mouthful required translation—textures his body didn't recognize, flavors his tongue had no context for. The rice was subtle, almost bland, but that blandness served as foundation for the sharp pickles, the deep salt of the miso.

"Sheldon-san." Tenchi had finished his rice and was eyeing the remaining pickles on Sheldon's plate. "Do you like takuan?"

"I don't know what takuan is."

"It's the yellow one. Grandpa says it's good for digestion."

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:23 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main house kitchen

"You may have it." Sheldon pushed the pickle toward Tenchi. The boy's eyes went wide with an enthusiasm that seemed disproportionate to fermented radish.

"Really?"

"I prefer the rice."

Tenchi seized the takuan with chopsticks that, unlike Sheldon's tentative grip, moved with natural precision. The crunch was audible across the table.

Katsuhito observed this exchange without comment. His own meal had been consumed in the time it took Sheldon to finish half his rice. The old man sat now with his empty bowls arranged before him, posture suggesting patience with no particular end point.

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:28 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main house kitchen

"The school bus arrives at seven-fifteen." Katsuhito rose, collecting bowls with movements that minimized sound. "Tenchi, you will brush your teeth and collect your bag. Your assignment from yesterday waits on your desk."

"I finished my assignment."

"You began your assignment. The final page has zero characters written."

Tenchi's face cycled through several emotions—surprise, protest, calculation, and finally resignation. He slid from his seat and padded toward his room.

Sheldon watched him go. "He has homework? He's four."

"He will be five in twenty days. And kindergarten here begins academic preparation earlier than American schools."

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:33 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Katsuhito's knowledge of American educational systems caught Sheldon off guard. He'd mentioned being American yesterday, a brief disclosure during introductions, but hadn't elaborated.

"You've studied American schools?"

"I have studied many things." Katsuhito handed him a damp cloth. "We wash dishes before beginning outside work. The cold makes food residue difficult to remove if left too long."

The answer wasn't really an answer. Sheldon accepted the cloth and the non-response together.

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:38 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Washing dishes required the same careful observation as everything else. Katsuhito demonstrated: scrape, rinse, scrub with a bundle of rice straw, rinse again, place in the drying rack. The water in the basin was cold, and Sheldon's hands protested immediately.

"You will build tolerance," Katsuhito said, watching Sheldon fumble a bowl. "The body adapts."

The body adapts. Sheldon thought of his previous hands—soft from years of chalk and keyboard, callused only from the grip of a pencil. These hands were different. Already toughening from yesterday's work.

He finished the bowl, set it in the rack, reached for the next.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:43 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Main house kitchen

Tenchi reappeared as Sheldon dried the last plate. The boy's bag hung from one shoulder, weighted with books or papers or whatever kindergarteners carried. His yellow cap was on his head, slightly crooked.

"Grandpa, I finished my homework."

"Show me."

The paper Tenchi produced was crumpled at the edges, covered in characters that looked more like abstract art than writing. Katsuhito examined it for a long moment.

"Acceptable. You may wait for the bus."

Tenchi bounced toward the door, then stopped. He turned, looking at Sheldon with an expression that seemed older than his years.

"Will you still be here when I get home?"

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:47 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main house kitchen

The question had weight. Sheldon recognized it as something other than idle curiosity.

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"I promise."

Tenchi's face relaxed. Whatever test the question represented, Sheldon had apparently passed. The boy nodded once, adjusted his bag, and disappeared through the door with a shout of "I'll be the first to the bus stop!"

The kitchen fell quiet. Sheldon looked at Katsuhito.

"He asks everyone that question?"

"He asks no one that question." Katsuhito's voice had dropped. "You are the first since his mother."

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:52 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main house kitchen

His mother. Tenchi's mother. Sheldon realized he knew nothing about her—hadn't thought to ask, had been too consumed by his own impossible circumstances to consider the household's history.

"What happened to—"

"Another time." Katsuhito moved toward the door. "The fence requires attention. Bring your questions to the work; they will keep your hands occupied."

The dismissal was gentle but absolute. Sheldon followed the old man out of the kitchen and into the cold morning air.

---

## SCENE 027 | 06:55 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Path between main house and tool shed

Dawn had arrived properly now. The sky above the shrine complex shifted from gray to pale blue, and the first direct light touched the torii gate at the entrance. Sheldon squinted against it.

The grounds looked different by morning light. Yesterday's maze of buildings and pathways resolved into a comprehensible layout: main house at the center, guest wing extending east, storage buildings clustered north, the shrine proper elevated on a small rise to the west.

Beyond the complex, the mountain. Forest climbing into mist.

"The shed is this way." Katsuhito had not paused for Sheldon's sightseeing.

---

## SCENE 028 | 06:58 | Tool Shed - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** North storage area

The tool shed smelled of oil and metal and old wood shavings. Katsuhito pushed open its double doors, revealing an interior organized with military precision. Hand tools hung from pegs arranged by size. Power tools—few, but present—occupied a workbench against the far wall. Lumber leaned in graded stacks against the left side.

"You will select your tools." Katsuhito gestured at the collection. "Tell me what we need."

A test. Sheldon studied the wall, thinking through yesterday's lessons. Fence repair. Damaged posts, broken slats.

"A saw. A hammer. Nails—" He spotted a bin of mixed hardware. "Those nails, the long ones. A measuring tape. Something to dig with, if the posts are rotted below ground."

---

## SCENE 029 | 07:02 | Tool Shed - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North storage area

"And the wood?"

Sheldon turned to the lumber stacks. Yesterday Katsuhito had explained the basics: cedar for outdoor use, pine for interior, cypress for everything important. The fence, he remembered, was cedar.

He moved to the appropriate stack. The boards were rough-cut, not planed, their surfaces showing saw marks. He ran his hand along one, checking for warps.

"These four." He indicated boards near the top of the stack. "They're straight. No visible cracks."

"Good." Katsuhito retrieved a canvas sack and began collecting the tools Sheldon had named. "You are learning to see."

---

## SCENE 030 | 07:06 | Tool Shed - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** North storage area

Learning to see. The phrase echoed something from Sheldon's academic life—a professor, thirty years ago, explaining how physics was fundamentally about seeing what was actually there instead of what you expected.

He lifted the cedar boards, one under each arm. The weight was manageable but awkward, and he had to adjust his grip twice before finding a balance that let him walk without stumbling.

Katsuhito watched this negotiation without offering help. When Sheldon had the boards stable, the old man nodded and led the way out of the shed.

---

## SCENE 031 | 07:10 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Path to north fence

The path to the north fence wound past the storage buildings and into a stand of bamboo that Sheldon hadn't noticed yesterday. The culms rose straight and close-packed, their leaves creating a rustling ceiling that filtered the morning light to green.

"This bamboo," he said, following Katsuhito. "Is it cultivated or wild?"

"Both. My great-grandmother planted the original grove. It has managed itself since."

Three generations. Four. Sheldon did the mathematics and stopped when the numbers grew uncomfortable.

---

## SCENE 032 | 07:14 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

The damaged fence came into view as they cleared the bamboo. Two posts leaned at angles that defied gravity, their bases clearly rotted through. Three horizontal slats had snapped, leaving gaps wide enough for a person to climb through.

Katsuhito set down the tool sack. "You see the problem."

"The posts are gone. We can't just replace the slats."

"Correct. We must dig out the old posts, set new ones, and then attach new slats. This is a full day's work, perhaps more."

Sheldon lowered the cedar boards to the ground. His arms thanked him.

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:18 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

"We begin with removal." Katsuhito handed Sheldon a narrow-bladed shovel. "Dig around the base of the first post. Do not attempt to pull it yet—you will only break what remains."

The ground was harder than Sheldon expected. His first strike with the shovel barely penetrated the surface, and the shock traveled up the handle into his palms. He adjusted his grip, tried again.

The second strike went deeper. The third found purchase.

"Smaller movements," Katsuhito said from somewhere behind him. "You are fighting the soil. Work with its grain."

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:23 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

Working with the soil's grain meant something Sheldon could almost understand. He slowed his pace, angled the shovel to slide between compacted layers rather than forcing through them.

The digging became easier. Not easy—his shoulders still protested, and sweat had begun to gather at his hairline despite the cold—but easier.

"You learn." Katsuhito had taken up position at the second damaged post, mirroring Sheldon's work with movements that looked effortless. "Most men fight longer before they listen."

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:28 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** North boundary

The old post emerged in sections. Sheldon had dug down perhaps eighteen inches when the first chunk of rotted wood broke free, soft and dark and smelling of decay. He lifted it out, examining the damage.

"It's eaten through. The whole base."

"Water damage. The previous posts were not treated properly before setting." Katsuhito paused his own digging. "A mistake made by my father, which I should have corrected years ago."

"Your father built this fence?"

The silence that followed lasted exactly long enough to confirm that Sheldon had asked the wrong question.

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:33 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** North boundary

"Continue digging." Katsuhito returned to his post. "We must reach clean soil before setting the new wood."

Sheldon continued. The question about Katsuhito's father settled into the same category as the question about Tenchi's mother: topics the old man would address on his own schedule, if at all.

The soil changed color as he dug deeper. Dark near the surface, where the rotted wood had leached into it, then gradually lighter until he reached clay. Red clay, dense and difficult.

"That is deep enough," Katsuhito said.

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:38 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

The rotted post came free with one final pull. Sheldon stumbled backward as it released, the weight of the thing catching him off guard. He managed not to fall, but only barely.

Katsuhito had already extracted his post. The old man stood beside a clean hole, the damaged wood set aside in a neat pile.

"Now we prepare the new posts." He moved to the cedar boards. "Cut two sections, each three feet long. The saw is in the bag."

Sheldon retrieved the saw—a Japanese style, pulling rather than pushing—and approached the first board.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:43 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

The saw confused his hands. Every instinct said push, and every push bound the blade in the wood. Sheldon forced himself to reverse the motion, pulling the saw toward his body, letting the teeth do their work on the backstroke.

The cut progressed slowly. Too slowly. He could feel Katsuhito watching, could sense the evaluation happening in real time.

"You are tensing your grip." The old man's voice came from directly beside him. "The saw knows what to do. Guide it; do not force it."

Sheldon loosened his fingers. The saw moved more freely. The cut lengthened.

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:48 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** North boundary

The first post section fell free, and Sheldon allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. The cut wasn't clean—slightly angled, with visible tear-out at the exit point—but it was complete.

"Better." Katsuhito handed him a piece of charred wood. "Mark this end. The charring will protect against rot."

The burned wood left black marks on the cedar. Sheldon covered the cut end thoroughly, following Katsuhito's example from the second post.

"This is the treatment you mentioned? That your father didn't use?"

"A version of it. There are better methods with modern chemicals. But fire has served for centuries."

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:53 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** North boundary

While Sheldon marked his post, Katsuhito began another preparation. A small metal container emerged from somewhere in the tool sack, filled with a thick, tar-like substance.

"This goes on next. After the char dries." He demonstrated, brushing the black paste over the post's base with quick strokes. "Two layers. Let the first dry before applying the second."

"What is it?"

"Pine tar. The same substance used on ship hulls." Katsuhito finished his application and set the post aside. "Waterproofing that predates written history."

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:58 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

Sheldon applied char to his second post section while the first dried. The work had developed a rhythm now—cut, char, dry, tar—and his muscles had stopped protesting quite so loudly.

The sun had risen above the tree line. Warmth touched his back through the borrowed shirt, and he paused to roll up his sleeves. The air still carried winter's memory, but the day was warming.

"We set the posts next," Katsuhito said, examining Sheldon's charring work. "This is adequate. You may begin the first application of tar."

---

## SCENE 042 | 08:03 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

The tar had a texture that resisted description. Not quite liquid, not quite solid. Sheldon dipped the brush and watched the substance coat the bristles with deliberate slowness.

He applied it to the post's base, working the tar into the charred wood as Katsuhito had demonstrated. The smell hit him—sharp and medicinal, nothing like the pleasant cedar scent of the raw wood.

"It is not pleasant," Katsuhito acknowledged. "But a fence treated this way will outlive us both."

Given what Sheldon suspected about Katsuhito's age, this was either reassurance or a very subtle joke.

---

## SCENE 043 | 08:08 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** North boundary

The first tar layer needed time to dry. Katsuhito suggested they use the interval to clear the remaining debris from the fence line—broken slats, accumulated leaves, a bird's nest that had built up in one of the gaps.

Sheldon gathered the debris into a pile while Katsuhito inspected the undamaged sections of fence.

"This portion is sound." The old man ran his hand along a horizontal slat. "Another ten years, perhaps, before it requires attention."

"You plan that far ahead?"

"I plan further." Katsuhito's smile was barely visible. "Planning shorter would be irresponsible."

---

## SCENE 044 | 08:13 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** North boundary

The debris pile grew. Sheldon discovered that the broken slats were heavier than they looked, their weight concentrated in ways that made carrying awkward. He adjusted, learned, dropped one piece, picked it up again.

"You asked about Tenchi's mother." Katsuhito spoke without looking at him. "Her name was Kiyone. She was my daughter."

Sheldon stopped, a broken slat in each hand.

"She died three years ago. Tenchi remembers little, which is perhaps a mercy."

---

## SCENE 045 | 08:18 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** North boundary

The information landed and sat. Sheldon didn't know what to do with it—didn't know the appropriate response, the expected words.

"I'm sorry."

"Yes." Katsuhito continued his inspection of the fence. "So am I."

Sheldon set down the broken slats. He wanted to ask what happened, how she died, what kind of person she'd been. He wanted to understand why Tenchi had asked if he'd still be here when the boy returned.

He didn't ask any of it.

"The tar should be dry now." Katsuhito turned back toward the posts. "Apply the second layer."

**Location:** North boundary

The second layer went on more smoothly than the first. Sheldon's hand had learned the brush's behavior, the tar's resistance, the amount of pressure needed.

He finished both posts while Katsuhito measured the holes, checking depth and width with a folding ruler that emerged from yet another pocket.

"This hole must be wider by two inches." The old man pointed. "The soil here is looser. The post will need room for gravel packing."

Sheldon retrieved the shovel.

**Location:** North boundary

Widening the hole was easier than digging the original. The soil had already been disturbed, and his arms had warmed to the work. Sheldon carved out the additional space in measured cuts, checking the diameter after each pass.

"Sufficient." Katsuhito produced a bucket of gravel from somewhere—Sheldon hadn't seen him retrieve it—and began pouring a layer into the first hole. "Now we set the post."

The tarred cedar was heavier than expected. Sheldon gripped its midsection, lifting carefully to keep the treated end from dragging in the dirt.

## SCENE 048 | 08:33 | North Fence - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** North boundary

Setting a fence post required two people. Sheldon held the cedar upright while Katsuhito checked its alignment with a wooden level—a simple thing, a cylinder of water in a glass tube, but effective.

"Slightly north." The old man's hands adjusted Sheldon's grip. "There. Hold."

Gravel poured into the hole, filling the gaps around the post. Katsuhito tamped it down with a flat stone, added more gravel, tamped again. The process continued until the post stood solid.

Sheldon let go experimentally. The post didn't move.

"One down," Katsuhito said. "One to go."

The second post went faster. Sheldon anticipated the measurements, positioned himself before Katsuhito asked, held the wood at the correct angle without guidance.

"You are understanding the work." Katsuhito tamped the final layer of gravel. "This is not simply following instructions."

"It's pattern recognition." Sheldon stepped back, examining their progress. Two new posts, straight and solid, waiting for slats. "Physics, basically. Force vectors, material properties."

"You reduce everything to physics?"

"Physics reduces everything to physics. I just notice."

Katsuhito laughed. The sound was unexpected—deep and genuine, escaping before the old man could contain it.

"You are an unusual person, Sheldon Tsukino."

The name still felt wrong. Tsukino. A family he'd never known, whose history had been constructed around him like scaffolding. Yet hearing it from Katsuhito's mouth made it more real than anything else had.

"I'm learning." Sheldon picked up a cedar slat, testing its weight. "Where do we nail these?"

The morning's work continued.
