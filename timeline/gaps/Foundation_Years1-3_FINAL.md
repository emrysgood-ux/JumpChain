# PART 1: YEAR 1 (April 1989 - March 1990)
## "Arrival"

### 1.1 — The Starting Conditions

**Sheldon arrives to:**
- A shrine in mourning (Kiyone died ~6 months prior)
- A 4-year-old who barely remembers his mother
- An elderly priest hiding 700 years of secrets
- A village that doesn't know him
- A body with abilities he doesn't understand
- Documents for a life he didn't live

**The Household:**
| Person | Status | Role |
|--------|--------|------|
| Katsuhito | ~700 | Patriarch; testing this stranger |
| Tenchi | 4 | Grieving; needs stability |
| Nobuyuki | ~35 | Weekend father; watchful |
| Kiyone | — | Recently dead; absence defines everything |

### 1.2 — Month-by-Month Progression

#### APRIL 1989: Arrival
**Days 1-28 | Theme: First Steps**

- **Day 1 (April 3):** Sheldon climbs 320 steps. Meets Katsuhito and Tenchi. Given Kiyone's old room.
- **Day 4 (April 6):** School year begins. First time at bus stop with village mothers.
- **Day 17 (April 19):** Hikaru the cat arrives (Yamamoto-san).
- **Day 22 (April 24):** **Tenchi's 5th birthday.** First without Mama. Quiet celebration.
- **Days 26-28:** Golden Week begins.

**Key Relationship Beats:**
- Katsuhito: Assessing. Silent tests (can he work? can he be trusted?)
- Tenchi: Curious but cautious. Watches from doorways.
- Village: "Who's the foreigner at the shrine?"

---

#### MAY 1989: Integration
**Theme: Proving Useful**

- Golden Week (May 1-5): Nobuyuki's first visit. Tense. Protective father assessing stranger.
- Children's Day (May 5): Sheldon helps with carp streamers. First time Tenchi seeks him out.
- Tool restoration begins with Tanaka-san.
- First visit to Tsukino property (inherited house — needs work).
- Yamada-sensei home visit (kindergarten teacher).

**Key Developments:**
- Sheldon establishes himself as useful (repairs, cooking, childcare)
- Village begins accepting "the American at the shrine"
- First genuine smile from Tenchi (Day ~45)

---

#### JUNE 1989: Rainy Season
**Theme: Indoor Focus**

- Tsuyu (rainy season) begins. Wet, humid.
- Interior repairs: tatami restoration with Hashimoto.
- Rainy day activities with Tenchi (reading, games, cooking together).
- Hikaru growing rapidly.
- Sheldon's cooking becomes household standard.

**Quiet Realization:**
Sheldon discovers his cooking is... different. People feel better after eating it. Not dramatically — just noticeably. He files this away, doesn't examine it.

---

#### JULY 1989: Summer Heat
**Theme: Settling In**

- Tanabata (July 7): First festival participation. Writes wish in Japanese (still learning).
- School summer break begins (~July 20).
- Firefly viewing at the lake (Tenchi's request).
- Kabutaro (rhinoceros beetle) acquisition — Tenchi's first pet project.
- Daily lake trips. Swimming. Cooling off.

**Milestone:** Tenchi graduates from "Sheldon-san" to "Sheru-ji" (affectionate nickname).

---

#### AUGUST 1989: Obon
**Theme: Memory and Loss**

- Peak summer heat (reminds Sheldon of Georgia).
- **Obon festival (mid-August):** Ancestors honored. Sheldon participates fully.
- **First anniversary of Kiyone's death.** Emotionally heavy. Tenchi doesn't fully understand but knows something is different.
- Nobuyuki visits. Cemetery trip. Quiet grief.
- Kabutaro dies (natural lifespan). First "death talk" with Tenchi.

**Turning Point:** Sheldon handles the beetle death conversation well. Katsuhito observes. Something shifts — the first real trust.

---

#### SEPTEMBER 1989: Return to Routine
**Theme: Established**

- School resumes (~September 1).
- Autumn equinox.

---

**Theme: Belonging**

- **Shichi-Go-San (November 15):** Tenchi is 5. Traditional celebration at shrine. Sheldon takes photos.
- Berlin Wall falls (November 9) — Sheldon hears on radio, processes privately. His timeline memories vs. this timeline's history.
- Winter preparation begins.
- Nobuyuki visits for Tenchi's shrine celebration.

**Relationship Status:**
- Katsuhito: Relies on Sheldon. Doesn't say so directly.
