# GAP F: YEAR 13 (2001-2002) — CANON BEGINS
## Son of Cosmos: "Oh No. I'm In THAT Anime."

---

# OVERVIEW

**Year:** 13 (April 2001 - March 2002)
**Tenchi's Age:** 16→17
**Phase:** Phase III begins
**Canon Events:** Ryoko awakens, Ayeka arrives, Sasami, Mihoshi, Ryo-Ohki, Washu

This is the year everything changes. Twelve years of quiet slice-of-life end. The universe Sheldon vaguely remembered from his previous life suddenly becomes real and present.

# THE RECOGNITION MOMENT

## Context: What Sheldon Knows (Before Year 13)

**Established Facts:**
- He knows he's in a different world/time
- He knows Yosho is an alien prince
- He knows Ryoko is sealed in the cave
- He knows Tenchi has "potential"
- He knows something is coming

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- The *name* of this universe
- The specifics of what happens next
- That this was an anime he'd seen
- The full cosmic scope (Chousin, Tsunami, etc.)

**The Memory Fog:**
Cosmos deliberately obscured his memories of media from his past life. He has vague impressions, feelings of familiarity, but no clear recall. This is protective — too much foreknowledge would paralyze him or alter events catastrophically.

## The Trigger: Summer 2001

**Setting:** The cave. The seal. Tenchi's curiosity.

**What Happens:**
Tenchi, now 17, finally does what Yosho has been dreading: he breaks the seal. He finds the sword. He awakens Ryoko.

**Sheldon's Location:** At the shrine, felt something shift

**The First Sign:**
Energy pulse. Massive. Unmistakable. Sheldon staggers. Every enhanced sense screams alert.

**Then Ryoko Appears:**

Cyan hair. Gold eyes. That specific energy signature. Floating. Laughing. Threatening. Beautiful and terrifying.

And Sheldon's mind *cracks*.

---

## The Recognition

### The Flood

It happens in fragments:

**First:** Her face. He KNOWS that face. Not from twelve years of sensing her in the cave. From... before.

**Second:** Her name. "Ryoko." And with the name comes... echoes. A title screen. Theme music. Laughter that sounds like this laughter.

**Third:** The word. The name. The *series*.

*Tenchi Muyo.*

And suddenly he's drowning in fragments:
- Opening credits he can almost see
- Character designs that match faces he knows
- Plot beats that feel inevitable
- An ocean of details he can't quite grasp

The memory fog doesn't lift completely. But it cracks. Enough.

### The Realization

Standing in the shrine, feeling Ryoko's awakening, Sheldon has a moment of absolute clarity:

*I'm in Tenchi Muyo.*

*I watched this. In my old life. On a screen.*

*This is an anime.*

*And I've been living in it for twelve years.*

### The Immediate Response

**Physical:** He sits down. Hard. On the floor. Doesn't trust his legs.

**Mental:** Racing. Trying to remember. What happens? Who comes? What's dangerous?

**Emotional:** Terror. Absurdity. Something almost like relief.

**What He Can't Remember:**
- Specific plot details
- Character fates
- The ending
- Technical details about powers
- Most of what happens after the first arc

**What He DOES Remember:**
- More women arrive. Many more.
- There's a villain. Kagato? The name feels right.
- Washu. A scientist. Trapped in gems.
- Princesses from Jurai.
- Police. Galaxy Police.
- It all works out somehow. The general *tone* was comedic.
- Tenchi was fine. Tenchi survived. Tenchi... won?

### The Problem

He knows *something*. But not enough. Not reliably. The fog gives him impressions, not facts. He can't warn anyone about specifics because he doesn't HAVE specifics.

And worse: if he changes too much, maybe the "good ending" doesn't happen.

# THE DAYS AFTER RYOKO'S AWAKENING

## Yosho's Explanation

Yosho finally tells Sheldon everything:
- The full story of his duel with Ryoko
- Why he sealed her instead of killing her
- The gems (Washu's prison)
- What Ryoko was and might become
- What Tenchi represents

Sheldon listens. Most of it confirms things he now half-remembers.

## Sheldon's Confession

After Yosho finishes, Sheldon admits:

> "I think... I've seen this before."

Yosho: "Seen what?"

> "This story. In my old life. I think it was... entertainment. A show. I watched it on a screen. But I can't remember clearly. It's like trying to recall a dream."

Yosho processes this for a long moment.

> "You're telling me our lives were a story in your world?"

> "Maybe. Or maybe I saw a version of it. Or a dream of it. I don't know. The memories aren't clear. I just know that when I saw Ryoko, something... clicked. Like I'd been waiting to recognize her."

Yosho's response:

> "Does it change anything?"

> "I don't think so. I can't remember enough to change anything. And I don't know if I should try."

> "Then we continue as we are. Protecting Tenchi. Protecting each other."

## The Decision

Sheldon makes a choice: He will NOT try to remember more. He will NOT try to steer events based on fragmentary knowledge.

**Reasons:**
1. The memories aren't reliable
2. Changing things might make them worse
3. The general outcome he remembers was *good*
4. His job is to be family, not prophet

He tells Yosho:

> "I'll watch. I'll protect where I can. But I won't try to play god. I don't remember enough to do it safely."

Yosho approves.

# THE CANON ARRIVALS

## The Harem Problem

As more women arrive, Sheldon recognizes the pattern. In the anime (he thinks), they were all romantic interests competing for Tenchi.

But Sheldon has been here for twelve years. He raised Tenchi. He shaped the household. And he knows what he wants:

**The Goal:** Transform harem dynamics into found family

**The Method:** 
- Treat each arrival with respect
- Establish clear household roles
- Make it obvious that Tenchi is not "available" in that way yet
- Model healthy adult relationships (him and Yosho)
- Give each woman something to *be* other than "Tenchi's potential girlfriend"

## The Arrivals (Year 13)

### Ryoko (Summer 2001)

**Canon Role:** The "first girl." Aggressive pursuer. Chaos agent.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Doesn't fear her (she senses this; it confuses her)
- Treats her as a person, not a threat or prize
- Offers food. (Food is universal.)
- Recognizes her loneliness (700 years sealed, conscious for some of it)

**Result:**
Ryoko is destabilized. The man who should fear her... doesn't. The man raising Tenchi welcomes her to dinner like she's a wayward relative.

She doesn't know how to process this.

**Key Line (Sheldon to Ryoko):**
> "You've been alone in that cave for centuries. Tenchi's going to need time. But you don't have to be alone anymore."

### Ayeka (Autumn 2001)

**Canon Role:** The princess rival. Formal, proud, immediately clashes with Ryoko.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Formal courtesy (she responds to this)
- Acknowledges her grief (she's searching for Yosho, thinks he's dead)
- Provides the revelation carefully (Yosho IS alive, is HERE)
- Helps bridge the awkwardness of Yosho's explanation

**Result:**
Ayeka is given respect and honesty instead of comedy misunderstandings. She still clashes with Ryoko, but has someone treating her like an adult.

**Key Line (Sheldon to Ayeka):**
> "Your Highness, I know you came searching for Yosho. He's here. He's been here for seven hundred years. He has a great deal to tell you, and I think you deserve to hear it in private."

### Sasami (With Ayeka)

**Canon Role:** The sweet little sister. Also secretly something else.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Kind to her immediately (she's a child, deserves kindness)
- Notices something... more. A depth. A knowing quality.
- Doesn't push. Doesn't pry.

**Result:**
Sasami feels safe. She senses Sheldon's strangeness but also his warmth. There's a mutual recognition that neither fully acknowledges.

**Key Line (Sasami to herself, about Sheldon):**
> "He smells like... home. But different home. Like stars but warm."

### Mihoshi (Late 2001)

**Canon Role:** Clutzy Galaxy Police officer. Chaos incarnate through incompetence.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Patient. So patient.
- Gives her structure (she desperately needs it)
- Finds things she can actually do
- Never makes fun of her

**Result:**
Mihoshi stabilizes slightly. Not much — she's Mihoshi — but having someone who doesn't mock her or dismiss her helps.

### Ryo-Ohki

**Canon Role:** Adorable cabbit. Also a spaceship.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Treats her like a family pet. (She is. Sort of.)
- Learns her dietary preferences (carrots)
- Includes her in household routines

**Result:**
Ryo-Ohki adores him. Will perch on his shoulder. Will cry when he's away too long.

### Washu (Late Year 13)

**Canon Role:** Greatest scientist in the universe. Also a goddess. Released from gems.

**Sheldon's Approach:**
- Respect for her intellect (genuine; he's a scientist too)
- Boundaries (he won't be a test subject)
- Curiosity about her work (she responds to this)

**What Washu Sees:**
The moment she's freed, Washu scans everyone. When she scans Sheldon:

> "...What are you?"

He doesn't know. She can tell he doesn't know. This fascinates her.

**Result:**
Washu begins her long investigation. But she also... respects him? He's the only one in the household who can follow her technical conversations.

# SHELDON'S INTERNAL JOURNEY (YEAR 13)

## The Weight

Living in a story you half-remember is exhausting. Every new arrival triggers fragments:
- "I've seen her before..."
- "This feels familiar..."
- "Something happens here, I think..."

But never enough. Never clear. Just echoes.

## The Acceptance

By the end of Year 13, Sheldon stops trying to remember.

He realizes:
1. His foreknowledge is too fragmentary to be useful
2. His presence has already changed things
3. The best thing he can do is be *present*, not prophetic

## The Role

He defines his purpose:
- Keep the household functional
- Be Tenchi's support (not rival, not competitor)
- Give each arrival a place that isn't "waiting for Tenchi"
- Model what adults can be
- Love Yosho. That's not going to change.

# THE TRANSFORMATION: HAREM → AUNTS

## The Mechanism

**Canon:** Women compete for Tenchi's romantic attention.
**Modified:** Women become part of a family structure.

**How:**
1. Sheldon's presence as father figure changes Tenchi's emotional landscape
2. Tenchi already HAS a complete family — he's not lonely/seeking
3. Each woman is given a role beyond "potential girlfriend"
4. Ryoko: Big sister energy, protector
5. Ayeka: Aunt, brings culture/formality
6. Sasami: Little sister (legitimately)
7. Mihoshi: Eccentric aunt, means well
8. Washu: Mad scientist aunt, fascinating/terrifying

## The Result

By Year 14, the household dynamic is "extended family" not "harem."

Tenchi loves them all. But not romantically. Not yet. They're his aunts, his sisters, his bizarre wonderful family.

Romance may come later. But it won't be competition. It'll be choice.
