# TSUKINO FAMILY — COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
## Gap 2 Resolution: Son of Cosmos
## Compiled December 29, 2025 — CORRECTED VERSION

---

# OVERVIEW

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:** Cosmos rewrote causality. The Tsukino family genuinely existed. Records exist. People remember them. Sheldon is genuinely their descendant. This is his actual family history.

The family name "Tsukino" (月野, "moon field") deliberately echoes Usagi Tsukino's family. Cosmos created a mother for Sheldon by drawing on her own.

**KEY FAMILY LOGIC:**
- **Mother = Yuki Tsukino** (Japanese, born into the Tsukino family)
- **Father = James Carter** (American, Black serviceman from Georgia)
- This explains Sheldon's Black American identity AND his Japanese family connection
- Property inheritance flows through his MOTHER's birth family

# KEY FIGURES

## "Mother" Yuki Tsukino (由紀) — THE TSUKINO PARENT

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | 月野 由紀 (Tsukino Yuki) |
| **Born** | 1930, Kamogata |
| **Died** | 1985 (age 55), cancer |
| **Personality** | Strong-willed, determined, independent |
| **Status** | **THE TSUKINO PARENT** — this is how Sheldon connects to the family |

**Life Story:**
- Born in Kamogata to the Tsukino family
- 1957: Met James Carter, American serviceman stationed at nearby base
- 1958: Emigrated to America with James; married in California
- 1959: Sheldon born in Oakland, California
- 1970: Divorced James; raised Sheldon alone
- 1970-1985: Worked factory jobs; maintained correspondence with family in Japan
- Taught Sheldon Japanese; told him about his heritage
- 1985: Died of cancer

**Her face in photos may echo Ikuko Tsukino** — Usagi's mother. Cosmos created a mother for Sheldon by drawing on her own.

## "Father" James Carter — THE AMERICAN PARENT

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | James Edward Carter |
| **Born** | 1932, Griffin, Georgia |
| **Died** | 1970 (when Sheldon was 10) |
| **Race** | Black American |
| **Occupation** | US Air Force (1955-1960), later mechanic |
| **Marriage** | Married Yuki 1958; divorced 1970 |

**Background:**
- From Georgia (same state as Sheldon's REAL origin)
- Met Yuki while stationed at Iwakuni Air Base
- Brief return to Japan together (1957-1958) before emigrating to California
- Marriage strained by cultural differences, economic hardship
- Divorced; died shortly after (car accident or illness — records unclear)

**CRITICAL:** James Carter explains Sheldon's Black American heritage. Cosmos may have based this fictional father on elements of Sheldon's actual background.

---

## Aunt Michiko Tsukino (道子) — THE CRITICAL FIGURE

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | 月野 道子 (Tsukino Michiko) |
| **Born** | 1928, Kamogata |
| **Died** | Late 1986 (illness, unspecified) |
| **Relationship** | **Mother's sister (maternal aunt)** |
| **Marital Status** | Never married |
| **Residence** | Lived in Okayama her whole life |

**CRITICAL ROLE:**
- The Tsukino house, shop, and land were HERS
- She left them to Sheldon as nearest living relative (sister's son)
- Sheldon "arrived for the funeral" in early 1987
- **She wrote THE LETTER before her death**

**The Letter:**
> Written months before her death, when she knew she was dying. Introduces Sheldon to her brother Kiyoshi (still living) and to the village. Requests community assistance for her American nephew.

**Narrative Implication:**
Villagers may vaguely remember "the American nephew who came for Michiko's funeral." This gives Sheldon plausible recognition: "Oh, you're the one who came for Michiko-san. She spoke of you."

## Uncle Kiyoshi Tsukino (清) — THE LIVING RELATIVE

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | 月野 清 (Tsukino Kiyoshi) |
| **Born** | 1922, Kamogata |
| **Age in 1989** | 67 |
| **Location** | Osaka (Higashiyodogawa-ku) |
| **Status** | ALIVE, retired factory foreman |
| **Health** | Arthritis, declining mobility |
| **Relationship** | **Mother's brother (maternal uncle)** |

**Physical Description:**
- Thin, slightly stooped from factory work
- 5'4" (has shrunk with age)
- Weathered face, kind eyes, sparse gray hair
- Kansai dialect (Osaka accent)
- Sheldon can see family resemblance to his mother Yuki

**Kiyoshi's Immediate Family:**
| Name | Relation | Age (1989) |
|------|----------|------------|
| Haruko (春子) | Wife | 64 |
| Masaru (勝) | Son | 40 |
| Yuki (由紀) | Daughter | 38 |
| Three grandchildren | — | 5-12 |

### Kiyoshi's Memories (Genuine History):

1. **1957-58:** His sister Yuki met an American serviceman; fell in love; emigrated
2. **1958-1980:** Yuki sent letters and photos over the years (Kiyoshi has a box of ~50 letters)
3. **1980:** Yuki brought Sheldon (age 21) to Japan for two weeks. They stayed with Kiyoshi.
4. **The Meeting:** Sheldon was quiet, polite, spoke good Japanese. "Looks like his father, but has Yuki's eyes."
5. **After Yuki died (1985):** Kiyoshi wrote to Sheldon offering family connection
6. **1987:** Sheldon came to Japan. Stayed with Kiyoshi briefly. Then went "traveling."
7. **1987-1989:** Received occasional letters from Sheldon

### Letters From Sheldon (In Kiyoshi's Possession):

| Date | Content |
|------|---------|
| May 1987 | "Thank you for your hospitality. I am traveling to see Japan. I will write again." |
| Aug 1987 | "I am in Kyoto. Studying. Thinking about what to do with my life." |
| Jan 1988 | "I spent New Year alone. Thinking of mother. Thank you for the omamori you sent." |
| Jun 1988 | "I have been working odd jobs. I am considering returning to Kamogata to see the family land." |
| Dec 1988 | "Happy New Year. I may come to the village in spring." |

**DANGER:** If Sheldon writes to Kiyoshi, his handwriting will match. If Kiyoshi visits, he will recognize Sheldon. The identity is REAL.

### Kiyoshi's Keepsake Box:

In his Osaka home, Kiyoshi has:
- Photos of Sheldon as a child (that Sheldon doesn't remember being taken)
- Photos of Sheldon's 1980 visit (that Sheldon doesn't remember)
- Letters from Yuki (~50 letters, 1958-1980)
- Photos of Yuki and Kiyoshi as young people
- Yuki and James's wedding photo
- The letters "Sheldon" sent from 1987-1989
- Birth certificate copy (Sheldon James Carter, March 15, 1959, Oakland, California)
- News clipping about Sheldon winning a science fair (1973)

## The Matriarch: Hana Tsukino (ハナ)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Born** | 1908, Kamogata |
| **Died** | 1979 (age 71) |
| **Role** | Mother of Kiyoshi, Yuki, and Michiko; raised children alone after husband died in war |

**Village says:** "Hana-san was strong. Raised three children alone after the war. Lived to see her daughter go to America, never saw her again."

**Grave:** Village cemetery, family plot.

**In photo:** Elderly woman in kimono, gentle smile — Sheldon's grandmother (in the created history).

# THE 1987 DATE EXPLANATION

## The Timeline Gap (1987-1989)

ID shows Sheldon registered as foreign resident in April 1987. Story begins April 1989. **Where was he for two years?**

**ANSWER:** This history genuinely happened. Sheldon simply has no personal memory of it — his conscious experience begins April 3, 1989.

### Sheldon's Documented History (1987-1989):

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Late 1986 | Aunt Michiko dies of illness |
| April 1987 | Sheldon arrives in Japan from USA; registers in Osaka |
| April-May 1987 | Stays with Uncle Kiyoshi; gets bearings |
| May-Dec 1987 | Travels Japan; works odd jobs; "finding himself" after mother's death |
| Jan-Dec 1988 | Continues traveling; occasional letters to uncle |
| Jan-Mar 1989 | Records go quiet; Sheldon "off the grid" |
| **April 3, 1989** | **AWAKENS with no memory of the past two years** |

### The Memory Gap:

Cosmos rewrote causality so that Sheldon's history in Japan is genuine. Uncle Kiyoshi has real memories of meeting him. The letters exist. The bank transactions are recorded. All of this genuinely happened within the timeline.

**What Sheldon experiences:** His conscious memory begins April 3, 1989. He has no access to memories of the preceding two years.

**What he can discover:** If he investigates, he'll find a complete history he personally doesn't recall.

**The gap:** This is similar to amnesia. The events happened; Sheldon simply cannot access those memories.

### If Asked About Those Years:

| Level | Response |
|-------|----------|
| General | "I was traveling. Processing my mother's death. I needed time alone." |
| If pressed for details | "Those months are blurry. Grief does that." (Genuinely true) |
| Medical interpretation | A professional might note dissociative symptoms consistent with grief |

**Note:** Sheldon's memory gap is genuine. The events happened; he simply cannot recall specifics. He doesn't need to lie — he just cannot remember.

# THE LETTER OF INTRODUCTION

## Physical Description

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Paper | Traditional Japanese letter paper (便箋), light blue lines |
| Envelope | Matching, addressed, stamp cancelled |
| Handwriting | Elderly hand, brush-influenced ballpoint; formal but warm |
| Length | Two pages, both sides |
| Condition | Read multiple times; creased; carried for "two years" |

## Sender Information

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | 月野 清 (Tsukino Kiyoshi) |
| Relation | Maternal uncle (mother's brother) |
| Location | Osaka |
| Age when written | ~65 (1987) |

## Letter Content (Translated) — CORRECTED:

> "To Whom It May Concern in Kamogata Town,
>
> I write to introduce my nephew, Tsukino Sheldon. He is the son of my late sister Yuki, who passed in 1985. Sheldon was born in America where my sister had emigrated after marrying an American, but he has always felt a connection to his mother's homeland.
>
> After completing his studies, Sheldon wishes to return to the village of his ancestors. Our family still owns property there — left by our sister Michiko who passed last year. He is educated, speaks Japanese (his mother taught him), and is of good character.
>
> I humbly request that the good people of Kamogata assist him as he establishes himself. Any kindness shown to him honors our family and my sister's memory.
>
> With deepest respect,
> Tsukino Kiyoshi, Osaka, April 1987"

**Note:** This letter is never shown to anyone in-story (yet). It's social proof Sheldon carries but hasn't needed.

# THE FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Size | Standard wallet size (~9cm × 6cm) |
| Paper | Photo paper, slightly faded edges |
| Date | Late 1970s (clothing/colors) |
| Season | Spring — cherry blossoms visible |
| Setting | Front of Tsukino house (when occupied) |
| Back | Handwritten: "月野家 昭和52年" (Tsukino Family, 1977) |

## People in Photograph (left to right):

1. **Elderly woman (~70):** Kimono, gentle smile — "Grandmother" Hana
2. **Middle-aged man (~55):** Work clothes — "Uncle" Kiyoshi
3. **Middle-aged woman (~48):** Simple dress — "Aunt" Michiko
4. **Young woman (~47):** American-style dress — "Mother" Yuki (visiting from America)

**Note:** Sheldon has no personal memory of meeting these people (his conscious experience begins in 1989). When he looks at this photo, he feels nothing immediate — and wonders if he should, given that these are his actual family members.

**Foreshadow:** Cosmos created these faces. They may unconsciously echo her own mortal family — Usagi's parents. Sheldon can never know this.

# UNCLE KIYOSHI CONTACT — STORY IMPLICATIONS

## The Gift:

Sheldon's parents died when he was 10. His grandmother raised him, then she died too. He spent decades substituting academic achievement for human connection.

Now he has:
- A living uncle who cares about him
- Cousins his own age
- Their children (family he can watch grow up)
- A family history that's REAL — because Cosmos made it real

**This isn't a problem to solve. It's healing.**

## Timeline (Natural Relationship Building):

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| Year 1 | Letters exchanged. "Settling into the village. The house needed work." |
| Year 2 | Phone calls. Maybe Kiyoshi visits, or Sheldon goes to Osaka for New Year. |
| Year 3+ | Regular family contact. Sheldon attends cousin's children's events. He's PART of this family. |

## What This Means for Sheldon:

Kiyoshi remembers Sheldon from his 1987 visit and their correspondence. The history is consistent with who Sheldon actually is — same personality, same handwriting, same quiet politeness. The only difference is that Sheldon cannot personally access memories from before April 1989.

He doesn't have to perform. He just has to show up and be present.

For a man who never had this before, that's everything.

# KOSEKI (FAMILY REGISTER) ENTRY

## 戸籍謄本 (Full Family Register Copy)

**Family Head:** 月野 清 (Tsukino Kiyoshi)
**Registered Address:** [Osaka address]
**This Branch Established:** April 1947

### Members:
1. **月野 清** (Tsukino Kiyoshi): Born 1922/6/14, Status: 本籍 (head)
2. **月野 由紀** (Tsukino Yuki): Born 1930/3/8, Died 1985/9/12 — sister, mother of Sheldon
3. **月野 道子** (Tsukino Michiko): Born 1928/11/2, Died 1986/12/15 — sister
4. **月野 シェルドン** (Tsukino Sheldon): Born 1959/3/15, Status: 現存 (living) — Yuki's son

**Notation:** Sister Yuki married American serviceman James Carter 1958; emigrated to USA; child born in Oakland, California; returned to Japan 1987 after mother's death to claim inheritance from aunt Michiko.

**This explains:** American name, American birth, Japanese family registry, return to ancestral village.

# WHY THIS STRUCTURE MATTERS

The **mother-as-Tsukino** structure resolves all logical problems:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why is Sheldon Black? | His father James Carter was Black American from Georgia |
| Why does he have Japanese heritage? | His mother Yuki was Japanese (Tsukino family) |
| How does he inherit Japanese property? | Through his mother's family (Aunt Michiko's estate) |
| Why does Uncle Kiyoshi care about him? | Kiyoshi is his mother's brother; Sheldon is his nephew |
| Why the name "Tsukino"? | It's his mother's maiden name; he took it to honor her |

This mirrors real patterns of mixed-heritage individuals connecting with maternal family roots.
