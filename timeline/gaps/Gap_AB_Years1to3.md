# GAPS A-B: YEARS 1-3 (1989-1992) — THE FOUNDATION YEARS
## Son of Cosmos: Building a Life From Nothing

---

# OVERVIEW

**Period:** Year 1 (April 1989 - March 1990) through Year 3 (April 1991 - March 1992)
**Tenchi's Age:** 4→7
**Phase:** Phase I (Subtle powers only)
**Focus:** Sheldon's integration, establishment of routines, village acceptance

These three years transform Sheldon from "mysterious stranger" to "part of the family." The groundwork for everything that follows is laid here.

---

# YEAR 1: MAY - DECEMBER 1989

## May 1989: First Full Month

**Week 1-2:**
- Sheldon learns shrine routines from Yosho
- Basic cleaning, maintenance, grounds keeping
- Tenchi constantly underfoot ("What are you doing? Can I help?")
- Sleep schedule stabilizes (finally)

**Week 3-4:**
- First village visit (with Yosho, formal introduction)
- Opens bank account (funds from "inheritance")
- Buys basic supplies, clothes, household items
- Begins learning which shops are where

**Key Moment: First Sunday Dinner**
Nobuyuki visits for weekend. Sheldon cooks. The food is... impossibly good.

Nobuyuki: "Where did you learn to cook like this?"
Sheldon: "I... had a lot of time alone."

This becomes his cover for all unexplainable skills: "I had time to learn."

## June 1989: Rainy Season

**Daily Routine Established:**
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:30 AM | Wake, wash, dress |
| 6:00 AM | Prepare breakfast |
| 7:00 AM | Breakfast with household |
| 8:00 AM | Shrine cleaning (with Yosho) |
| 10:00 AM | Grounds maintenance or household tasks |
| 12:00 PM | Lunch |
| 1:00 PM | Personal time / reading / exploration |
| 3:00 PM | Tenchi's return (when school is in session) |
| 5:00 PM | Dinner preparation |
| 6:00 PM | Dinner |
| 7:00 PM | Evening activities |
| 9:00 PM | Retire |

**First Crisis: Tenchi Gets Sick**
Common cold. Fever. Nothing serious. But Sheldon's response — attentive, calm, competent — proves something to Yosho.

This man knows how to care for a child.

**Rainy Day Activities:**
- Reading (Sheldon devours everything available)
- Indoor games with Tenchi
- Cooking experiments
- Quiet conversations with Yosho

## July 1989: Summer Heat

**Tenchi's Summer Vacation Begins**
Tenchi is around constantly. Sheldon becomes:
- Playmate
- Supervisor
- Teacher
- Storyteller

**First Home Project:**
The guest room where Sheldon sleeps has a leaky window frame. He fixes it. Yosho notices. Says nothing. Files away: *Useful skills.*

**Tanabata (July 7):**
Village festival. First public event Sheldon attends.

Tenchi writes a wish: "I want Sheldon to stay forever."
Sheldon doesn't write anything. What would he wish for?

**The Lake:**
Sheldon goes to the lake for the first time. Feels something... wrong. Unsettling. Like being watched by something vast and patient.

He doesn't go back often.

## August 1989: Obon

**The Challenge:**
Obon is about honoring ancestors. Sheldon's "ancestors" are a fabrication. He never knew the Tsukino family.

But he goes through the motions:
- Visits the family grave plot (that exists because Cosmos made it exist)
- Offers incense to people he never met
- Feels like a fraud

**Yosho's Observation:**
> "You seem uncomfortable."

Sheldon: "I'm honoring family I don't remember."

Yosho: "Memory is not the only form of connection. You are here. That matters."

This is the first hint that Yosho suspects something is different about Sheldon.

**The Heat:**
- No air conditioning at shrine
- Sheldon's enhanced body handles it easily
- Yosho notices he doesn't sweat appropriately
- Another note filed away

## September 1989: Routines Deepen

**Tenchi Returns to School:**
Kindergarten resumes. Tenchi talks about Sheldon constantly at school.

Teacher asks: "Who is Sheldon?"
Tenchi: "He lives with us! He cooks and tells stories and knows everything!"

**First Parent-Teacher Event:**
Sheldon doesn't attend (not appropriate). But he helps Tenchi prepare, and hears all about it after.

**Village Gossip:**
"The American at the shrine is strange. Polite, though."
"Katsuhito-san seems to like him."
"Have you tried his cooking? Better than mine, honestly."

## October 1989: Autumn

**First Autumn Festival:**
Sheldon participates fully. Helps with preparations. Is seen publicly as "shrine staff."

**The Tsukino Property:**
Sheldon visits the family property for the first time. The house that "Aunt Michiko" left him.

It's real. A modest traditional house. Abandoned but not derelict. Furniture covered in sheets. Dust everywhere.

He doesn't move in. Not yet. But he knows it's there.

**Cool Weather Cooking:**
Sheldon's autumn menu emerges:
- Hot pot nights
- Simmered dishes
- Baked sweet potatoes
- Comfort food

The household gains weight. No one complains.

## November 1989: Seven-Five-Three (Shichi-Go-San)

**Tenchi's Celebration:**
Tenchi is 5 — the traditional celebration year for boys.

Sheldon helps prepare:
- New clothes (purchased with Nobuyuki)
- Temple visit
- Family photos
- Special meal

**The Photograph:**
There exists, from this day, a photograph of:
- Yosho in formal robes
- Tenchi in hakama
- Nobuyuki in suit
- Sheldon standing slightly apart, uncertain of his place

Nobuyuki insists Sheldon be in the picture. "You're family now."

Sheldon doesn't argue. But he's not sure he believes it.

## December 1989: First Cosmos Dream

**The Context:**
Sheldon has been having vague dreams since arrival. Warmth. Light. A presence. Nothing clear.

This month, it clarifies.

**The Dream (Late December):**
Setting: Silver void. Endless but not empty.

Sheldon feels:
- Watched
- Loved (maternal, protective)
- Approved of

He sees (vaguely):
- A figure. Female. Tall. Silver-white.
- Wings? Or just light?
- A smile.

No words. Not yet. Just presence. Acknowledgment.

He wakes knowing:
*Whatever put me here is still watching. And is pleased.*

**New Year's Preparations:**
- Shrine cleaning (major undertaking)
- Mochi pounding
- Decoration installation
- Sheldon learns all the traditions

# YEAR 2 (1990): THE SETTLING

## Overview

Year 2 is when Sheldon stops being a guest and becomes a fixture.

**Key Developments:**
- Routine is automatic now
- Village knows and accepts him
- Tenchi starts elementary school
- Yosho begins to trust him with responsibilities
- First contact with Uncle Kiyoshi

## Spring 1990

**Tenchi's Kindergarten Graduation (March):**
Sheldon attends as "family friend." Sits with Nobuyuki. Watches Tenchi receive his certificate.

Feels something he hasn't felt in decades: pride in someone else.

**Cherry Blossom Viewing:**
First hanami with the family. Sheldon prepares the bento. It's absurdly good.

Nobuyuki: "You could open a restaurant."
Sheldon: "I prefer cooking for family."

(The word "family" comes out without thinking. Everyone notices. No one comments.)

**Elementary School Begins (April):**
Tenchi starts 1st grade. New routine:
- Walks down the mountain alone (with Sheldon watching until he's out of sight)
- Returns in the afternoon
- Homework becomes a thing

Sheldon helps with homework. He's patient. Explains things in ways Tenchi understands.

## Summer 1990

**First Contact with Uncle Kiyoshi:**
Sheldon finally writes to his "uncle" in Osaka.

The letter:
> "Dear Uncle,
> I have settled in Okayama, at the Masaki Shrine. The priest, Katsuhito-san, has been generous with employment and housing. I am well.
> I apologize for not writing sooner. The transition has been difficult.
> I hope this finds you and the family in good health.
> Your nephew, Sheldon"

Kiyoshi's response (received two weeks later):
> "Dear Sheldon,
> Your aunt Haruko cried when she received your letter. We were worried. Please visit when you can. You are always welcome in Osaka.
> Uncle Kiyoshi"

Sheldon reads this letter multiple times. This man genuinely cares about him. Because of memories that never happened.

**Summer Project: Workshop**
Sheldon identifies a space in the Tsukino property suitable for a workshop. Begins cleaning and organizing it. Nothing major yet — just potential.

**Repair Business Begins:**
Village elder's radio breaks. Sheldon fixes it. Word spreads.

By end of summer, he has a reputation:
"The American at the shrine can fix anything."

## Autumn 1990

**The Routine Deepens:**
- Weekly rice deliveries arranged
- Standing order at the greengrocer
- Nodding acquaintance with most villagers
- Shrine duties handled smoothly

**Yosho's Trust:**
Yosho begins leaving Sheldon alone at the shrine more often. Short trips. Testing.

Sheldon handles everything. Yosho returns to find nothing wrong and a warm meal waiting.

## Winter 1990

**Second Cosmos Dream:**
Clearer than the first. The figure is more defined. Still no words, but the emotional content is stronger:

*You are doing well.*
*This is right.*
*Continue.*

**First Christmas with Family:**
Christmas isn't a huge deal in Japan, but the household acknowledges it because of Sheldon's American background.

Tenchi makes him a card. Crayon drawing of the shrine, with a figure labeled "SHELDON" standing in front.

Sheldon keeps this card forever.

# YEAR 3 (1991): INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## Overview

By Year 3, Sheldon is no longer the "American stranger." He's just... Sheldon. Part of the shrine. Part of the family.

**Key Developments:**
- Village acceptance is complete
- Repair business is established
- Yosho begins to actively observe Sheldon's abilities
- Tenchi's bond with Sheldon is unshakeable
- Sheldon-Yosho friendship deepens significantly

## Spring 1991

**Tenchi's 7th Birthday (April 24):**
Major celebration. Both households (shrine and Nobuyuki's) gather.

Sheldon makes a cake. From scratch. It's perfect.

Tenchi's wish (blowing out candles): He won't say. But he looks at Sheldon when he makes it.

**First Real Crisis: Storm Damage**
Major storm damages shrine roof. Sheldon climbs up to assess damage immediately.

Yosho watches him move on the roof — sure-footed, unafraid, efficient.

More notes filed away.

## Summer 1991

**Uncle Kiyoshi Visit:**
Kiyoshi comes to visit (first in-person meeting since the created 1987 encounter).

**What Kiyoshi Sees:**
- His "nephew" healthy, happy, integrated
- A beautiful shrine
- A kind priest who speaks well of Sheldon
- A child who clearly adores Sheldon

**What He Feels:**
Relief. His sister's son is okay.

**The Meeting:**
Awkward at first. Kiyoshi has memories of a Sheldon who doesn't remember those events.

But Sheldon's personality matches. His mannerisms match. Kiyoshi accepts the slight strangeness as "he's been through a lot."

They part with plans to visit again.

## Autumn 1991

**Village Festival: Full Participation**
Sheldon helps organize the festival. Coordinates volunteers. Cooks for the celebration.

Village elder publicly thanks him:
> "The shrine is lucky to have you, Sheldon-san."

**Yosho's Direct Questions:**
One evening, Yosho asks directly:
> "You do not sleep as much as you should. You eat less than expected for your work level. You heal quickly from small injuries. Who are you, Sheldon-san?"

Sheldon deflects:
> "I was always... efficient. I don't know why."

Yosho accepts this. For now.

## Winter 1991-92

**Third Cosmos Dream:**
The clearest yet. The figure speaks — not in words, but in concepts:

*My son.*
*You have done well.*
*There is more to come.*
*Trust the bond you're building.*

Sheldon wakes with tears on his face. Doesn't know why.

**New Year 1992:**
Third New Year at the shrine.

Tenchi stays up until midnight for the first time. Falls asleep on Sheldon's shoulder at 11:30. Sheldon carries him to bed.

Yosho watches this. Says:
> "He loves you."

Sheldon: "I love him too."

This is the first time either has said the word "love" in the other's presence.
