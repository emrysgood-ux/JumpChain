# FIRST COSMOS DREAM (December Year 1)

**What Sheldon Perceives:**
- Not a figure, but a feeling
- Vast, ancient, kind
- A voice (or impression):
> "You are where you should be."
> "Rest. Grow. Be patient."
> "I am proud of you."

Sheldon wakes uncertain if it was real. But he feels better. Less lost.
