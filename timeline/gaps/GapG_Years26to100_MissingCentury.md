# GAP G: YEARS 26-100 — THE MISSING CENTURY
## Son of Cosmos: Domestic Eternity Begins
## Compiled December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

**Period:** Years 26-100 (2014-2089)
**Sheldon's Apparent Age:** Stabilizes at ~25-27 (ageless)
**Yosho's Apparent Age:** Drops illusion; appears ~30-35 (true young form)
**Tenchi's Age:** 30→105

This is where "happily ever after" becomes 75 years of actual life. The adventure phase is over. Now they have to figure out how to be a family that lives forever.

# PART 1: THE WEDDING (Year 35 / 2024)

## 1.1 — Why Year 35?

**Not immediate after Year 25:**
- They've been partners for 35 years
- The proposal happened Year 24 (Juraian ship-bond tradition)
- Year 25: Village acknowledgment ("We Know" speech)
- Years 26-34: Processing, planning, letting the household adjust
- Year 35: Everything is stable enough for a ceremony

**Why wait 10 years after proposal?**
- Yosho has been alone for 700+ years; he needed time to believe it was real
- The household needed to stabilize post-canon chaos
- Juraian ceremonies require preparation (political implications)
- They weren't in a rush — they have eternity

## 1.2 — The Ceremony

**Date:** Autumn, Year 35 (October 2024)
**Location:** Masaki Shrine grounds, by Funaho-no-ki (Yosho's tree)

### Structure (Hybrid Ceremony):

**Part 1 — Juraian Bond-Oath**
- Performed at dawn, private
- Only witnesses: Funaho (the tree), Tsunami (through Sasami)
- Yosho's Light Hawk Wings manifest briefly — a promise made visible
- Sheldon's Lambda energy responds — silver light twining with blue
- No words needed; the trees record it

**Part 2 — Earth Ceremony**
- Performed at noon, public (household + village elders)
- Shinto-style ceremony adapted by Yosho
- Sake exchange, vows spoken in Japanese
- Tenchi serves as... complicated role (son? nephew? best man? all of the above)
- Ayeka weeps (happy tears, political relief)
- Ryoko pretends not to be emotional (fails)
- Washu records everything for "science"
- Mihoshi somehow doesn't destroy anything

**Part 3 — Reception**
- Village celebration
- The entire household cooks (Sheldon coordinates)
- Villagers attend knowing something cosmic is happening
- No one asks questions; everyone celebrates

### What Sheldon Wears:
- Traditional montsuki hakama (black)
- His grandmother's ring on a chain (from Cosmos-created history)
- Nothing flashy — he's not the flashy type

### What Yosho Wears:
- Drops the elderly illusion completely
- Appears as his true age: early 30s, sharp-featured, silver-streaked purple hair
- Traditional Juraian formal robes (first time wearing them in 700 years)
- The village sees his real face for the first time

### The Vows (Earth Ceremony):

**YOSHO:**
> "I have lived seven hundred years waiting for something I could not name. You arrived with no explanation, no demands, and the patience of someone who understood loneliness. I offer you the centuries I have remaining. However many there are. They are yours."

**SHELDON:**
> "I died once. I was given a second chance I didn't earn and don't understand. I've spent thirty-five years trying to be worthy of it. Standing here, I think maybe this is what it was for. Not saving the universe. Just... finding you. Finding home."

## 1.3 — Political Implications

**Jurai's Response:**
- Yosho formally notifies Jurai of his marriage
- First time he's contacted home in centuries for personal reasons
- Azusa (Yosho's father, still Emperor) is... complicated
- Misaki (Yosho's mother) sends gifts and cries for a week
- The marriage has no succession implications (Yosho abdicated long ago)
- But it DOES establish Sheldon as Juraian nobility by marriage

**Earth's Response:**
- The village already knew
- Legal marriage registered (Japan doesn't recognize same-sex marriage in 2024, but Juraian law supersedes)
- Washu handles the paperwork somehow
- To the outside world: nothing changes

---

# PART 2: THE CHILDREN (Years 39-60)

## 2.1 — Achika (Born Year 39 / 2028)

**Conception:**
- Sheldon builds the Birthing Matrix as a surprise
- Uses Juraian bio-technology principles + his own innovations
- Yosho's genetic material + Sheldon's genetic material + Lambda energy stabilization
- Washu is informed AFTER gestation begins; observes but doesn't intervene

**Birth:**
- Full-term equivalent in growth chamber
- "Born" in the shrine's private wing
- Named after Tenchi's mother (with Tenchi's tearful permission)

**Achika's Traits:**
- Female
- Yosho's bone structure, Sheldon's eyes
- Calm temperament (Sheldon's influence)
- Juraian power potential (can bond with trees)
- Minor Lambda resonance (emotional triggers only)

**Year 39 Family Structure:**
- Sheldon & Yosho: Parents
- Tenchi (age 44): Older brother (insists on this designation)
- Household "aunts": Doting extended family
- Village: Accepts another miracle without questions

## 2.2 — Mamoru (Born Year 41 / 2030)

**Conception:**
- Washu ASKS to participate this time
- She wants to study the system she didn't invent
- Collaboration between Sheldon's design and Washu's refinements

**Birth:**
- Similar process
- Named for "protection" (守)

**Mamoru's Traits:**
- Male
- **Pink hair** (Usagi's genetics expressing through Cosmos lineage)
- This is the first visible sign that something from Cosmos passed through
- Energetic, curious, opposite temperament to his sister
- Slightly stronger Lambda resonance than Achika

**The Pink Hair Moment:**
When Mamoru is born with pink hair, the household pauses. Everyone looks at Sheldon. Sheldon looks at his hands. He doesn't understand either.

Washu: "Well. That's not from Yosho's side."

Sheldon: "I... don't know why..."

But somewhere, in a dream that night, he sees silver light smiling.

## 2.3 — Additional Children (Years 45-60)

**Confirmed:** "Several more" — exact count TBD

**Pattern:**
- Spacing of 3-5 years between children
- Mix of traits from both parents
- Each child slightly different Lambda expression
- All can potentially bond with Juraian trees
- None inherit Sheldon's full cosmic power

**Suggested Family:**
| Child | Birth Year | Notable Trait |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Achika | 39 (2028) | Firstborn, calm, Juraian-dominant |
| Mamoru | 41 (2030) | Pink hair, energetic, Lambda-visible |
| Third | ~45 (2034) | TBD |
| Fourth | ~50 (2039) | TBD |
| Fifth | ~55 (2044) | TBD |

**Why Stop?**
- Not biological limitation (Matrix can produce indefinitely)
- Personal choice: "Five is enough to fill a house"
- Each child deserves attention, not production-line parenting
