## WINTER (December 2001 - February 2002) — KAGATO ARC

### December: Kagato Approaches

**Trigger:** Kagato has been searching for Ryoko's gems and Tsunami's power for 700 years. He finally locates them.

**Pre-Attack:**

| Event | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Household has settled | 5 months of integration |
| Routines established | Functional family |
| Sheldon's role clear | Everyone relies on him |
| Tenchi's training advanced | Yosho pushed harder |

### The Kagato Arc — Sequence

**Day 1: Arrival**

| Event | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Kagato's ship detected | Orbit |
| Household alerted | Shrine |
| Kagato demands Ryoko | Communication |
| Ryoko's terror (she remembers him) | Shrine |

**Key Scene: Ryoko's Fear**

Canon establishes Kagato controlled Ryoko for millennia, tortured away her emotions. Our version:
- Ryoko's fear is genuine, visceral
- Household sees her vulnerability
- Sheldon witnesses her breakdown
- First time she's truly helpless since arrival

**Day 2: Kidnapping**

| Event | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Kagato takes Ryoko | Same as canon |
| Household mobilizes | Faster due to structure |
| Plan formed | Yosho leads, Sheldon supports |
| Pursuit begins | Same stakes |

**Day 3: Battle on Soja**

| Event | Canon | Our Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Board Kagato's ship | Same | Same |
| Confront Kagato | Same | Same |
| Tenchi vs Kagato | Same | Same |
| Tenchi manifests 3 LHW | **PRESERVED** | Same trigger |
| Kagato defeated | Same | Same |
| Washu freed | Same | Same |

**CRITICAL:** Tenchi's Light Hawk Wing manifestation happens exactly as in canon. This is a fixed point — his heritage, his power, his destiny.

### The Washu Emergence

**Immediate:**

| Event | Canon | Our Version |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Washu freed from 5,000-year imprisonment | Same | Same |
| She joins household | Same | Same |
| Establishes lab | Same | Same |
| Immediately interested in Tenchi | Same | Same |

**NEW ELEMENT: Washu Notices Sheldon**

Within days of joining household:

| Observation | Washu's Thought |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Sheldon's energy signature | "This doesn't match any known classification" |
| His integration into household | "He's been here longer than the others" |
| His relationship with Yosho | "Interesting..." |
| His lack of reaction to her | "He's not surprised by me" |

**Washu's Initial Scan Results:**

```
SUBJECT: Sheldon Carter (claimed identity)
SPECIES: Human (apparent)
AGE: 38 years (claimed)
ENERGY SIGNATURE: [UNCLASSIFIED]
ORIGIN: [CANNOT DETERMINE]
THREAT LEVEL: [INSUFFICIENT DATA]
NOTES: Subject displays power signature inconsistent with 
       any known human, Juraian, or galactic standard. 
       Signature suggests external dimensional origin but 
       does not match any catalogued dimension (1-22).
       Further investigation required.
```

**Washu's Decision:**
- Does NOT immediately confront
- Begins long-term observation
- Adds to research projects
- Files under "anomalies to investigate"
