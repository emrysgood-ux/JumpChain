# YEAR 5 (1993): THE TENCHI REVELATION
## Son of Cosmos: Telling the Boy
## December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

Less than a year after revealing himself to Yosho, Sheldon tells Tenchi the truth. Not because he has to. Because he refuses to build a father-son relationship on lies.

**Timeline Context:**
- Year 5 = April 1993 - March 1994
- Tenchi is 8-9 years old (Elementary 3rd Grade)
- Sheldon revealed truth to Yosho ~10 months ago (June 1992)
- Training with Yosho is ongoing
- Sheldon has been living a divided life — honest with one, hiding from the other

---

# PART 1: THE PROBLEM

## 1.1 — Sheldon's Dilemma

After Year 4, Sheldon's household life has become bifurcated:

| With Yosho | With Tenchi |
|------------|-------------|
| Honest about nature | Hiding abilities |
| Can use abilities openly | Must suppress constantly |
| Training partner | "Normal" father figure |
| Equals with secrets | Adult deceiving child |

**The Weight:**

Sheldon unburdened himself to Yosho because he *couldn't stand the deception anymore*. The relief was profound. But now he's doing the same thing to Tenchi — the child he's raised for four years, the boy who calls him "Sheru-ji" and trusts him completely.

Every time Tenchi asks an innocent question and Sheldon deflects, it cuts.

## 1.2 — What Tenchi Has Noticed

Children are observant. By early Year 5, Tenchi has noticed:

| Observation | His Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Sheldon and Grandpa train at dawn/dusk | "Grown-up stuff" |
| Conversations stop when he enters | "They're talking about me?" |
| Sheldon moves differently sometimes | Can't articulate, but feels it |
| Sheldon's cooking is impossibly good | "He's just really good" |
| Sheldon never gets sick | Hasn't consciously noticed yet |
| Sheldon can see in the dark | Starting to notice |

**Tenchi's Emotional State:**

He doesn't feel excluded exactly, but something has shifted. Grandpa and Sheldon share something now. Something he's not part of. For a child who lost his mother and whose father is mostly absent, this is unsettling.

## 1.3 — Yosho's Position

Yosho has observed both Sheldon's discomfort and Tenchi's quiet uncertainty. When Sheldon raises the possibility of telling Tenchi, Yosho's response:

> "He is your son in all the ways that matter. The choice is yours."

Yosho neither encourages nor discourages. He trusts Sheldon's judgment. He also knows that Tenchi is perceptive enough that continued deception may do more harm than truth.

**Yosho's Caveat:**

> "Tell him about yourself. Not about me. Not yet. He is too young for the weight of Jurai."

Sheldon agrees. This is about Sheldon's truth, not Yosho's.

---

# PART 2: THE TRIGGER

## 2.1 — The Moment (Early Summer 1993)

**Setting:** A warm evening, late spring. Nobuyuki is in Kurashiki. Yosho is at evening prayers. Tenchi should be asleep.

**What Happens:**

Sheldon is in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner. The lights are off — he doesn't need them. He's moving efficiently, putting things away, lost in thought about tomorrow's training session.

He hears soft footsteps in the hallway. Tenchi, coming for a glass of water.

Sheldon freezes. The kitchen is dark. Pitch dark. And he's standing at the counter, clearly able to see, clearly functional.

Tenchi appears in the doorway. Stops.

"Sheru-ji? Why are you in the dark?"

## 2.2 — The Choice

Sheldon could:
- Turn on the light quickly, pretend he was about to
- Claim he was just standing there, not doing anything
- Make a joke about forgetting
- Deflect with "Go back to bed"

He's done all of these before. Small lies. Comfortable evasions.

But Tenchi is standing there in his pajamas, eight years old, looking at him with those trusting eyes. The same eyes that watched Sheldon climb the shrine steps four years ago. The eyes of the child he's been raising.

Sheldon sets down the dish he's holding.

"I can see in the dark, Tenchi."

## 2.3 — The Beat of Silence

Tenchi doesn't run. Doesn't scream. He's eight, not four. He processes.

"...Like a cat?"

"Something like that."

"Is that why you never turn on the hall light at night?"

Sheldon almost laughs. Of course Tenchi noticed that too.

"Yes. That's why."

Tenchi is quiet for a moment. Then:

"Can you... do other things?"

And Sheldon realizes this is the moment. Not planned. Not scripted. Just a boy in pajamas and a man who's tired of lying.

"Yes. I can do other things. Do you want me to tell you about it?"

---

# PART 3: THE CONVERSATION

## 3.1 — Setting the Scene

Sheldon turns on a small lamp — for Tenchi's comfort, not his own. They sit at the kitchen table. Sheldon makes Tenchi warm milk (the boy is going to need comfort). 

This isn't a formal revelation. It's a late-night conversation between a father and son.

## 3.2 — What Sheldon Tells Him

**The Framework:** Age-appropriate truth. No cosmic metaphysics. No terrifying details. Just enough to be honest.

---

**"Something happened to me."**

"Before I came here, before I climbed those steps, something happened to me. I was... hurt. Very badly. And then I woke up, and I was different."

"Different how?"

"I can see in the dark. I can hear things far away. I don't get sick. And when I cook..." He pauses. "When I cook, the food helps people feel better. Really helps them."

Tenchi considers this. "Is that why your food is so good?"

"Part of it is practice. Part of it is... something else."

---

**"Someone helped me."**

"I don't know who or what helped me. But something did. Something gave me this chance — to be here, to live here, to be with you and Grandpa."

"Like a... guardian angel?"

Sheldon's heart clenches. It's not inaccurate. "Maybe something like that."

"Do they talk to you?"

"Sometimes. In dreams. Not often."

---

**"This is who I am now."**

"I'm still Sheldon. I'm still me. I still make your breakfast and help with your homework and argue with Grandpa about how much sugar goes in the tea. This doesn't change any of that."

"But you're not... normal?"

"No. I'm not normal. But I'm still yours. I'm still here. And I'm not going anywhere."

---

## 3.3 — What Tenchi Asks

Children ask the questions adults are afraid to voice:

**"Are you an alien?"**
> "No. I'm human. Just... different."

**"Does Grandpa know?"**
> "Yes. I told him last year. He's been helping me understand what I can do."

**"Does Dad know?"**
> "No. And I need you to help me keep this secret from him. Can you do that?"
> "Why?"
> "Because your dad worries enough. And because some things are just for us — for our family here at the shrine."

**"Is that why you and Grandpa train early in the morning?"**
> "Yes. He's teaching me to control what I can do."

**"Can you show me something?"**
> Sheldon pauses. Then he reaches over and turns off the lamp. The kitchen plunges into darkness. "What do you see?"
> "Nothing. It's too dark."
> "I can see you perfectly. Your pajamas have a small hole near the left pocket. You missed a spot of toothpaste on your chin."
> Tenchi's hand goes to his chin. "...Whoa."

**"Were you scared? When it happened?"**
> This one stops Sheldon. Eight years old, and already asking the real questions.
> "Yes. I was very scared. I didn't know what was happening to me. I didn't know where I was. And then I found this place. I found you and Grandpa. And I wasn't scared anymore."

**"Will you get more different?"**
> "I don't know. Maybe. Probably. But whatever happens, I'll still be me. I'll still be here. Okay?"
> "Okay."

---

## 3.4 — The Most Important Exchange

Near the end of the conversation:

**Tenchi:** "Sheru-ji?"

**Sheldon:** "Yes?"

**Tenchi:** "I'm glad you told me. I don't like secrets."

**Sheldon:** (heart breaking a little) "Neither do I."

**Tenchi:** "I'm glad you're here."

**Sheldon:** "I'm glad I'm here too."

---

# PART 4: YOSHO'S ROLE

## 4.1 — Before

Sheldon spoke with Yosho earlier that day (not knowing the evening would bring revelation):

> **Sheldon:** "I can't keep hiding from him. He's starting to notice. He's starting to feel left out."
> 
> **Yosho:** "You know my thoughts on this."
> 
> **Sheldon:** "Tell me anyway."
> 
> **Yosho:** "He is strong enough to bear truth. He has borne worse — losing his mother at four. Give him the respect of honesty."

## 4.2 — After

The next morning, Yosho finds Tenchi at breakfast looking at Sheldon with new eyes. Not fear. Not awe. Just... knowing.

Yosho catches Sheldon's eye. A slight nod.

Later, privately:

> **Yosho:** "He seems to have taken it well."
> 
> **Sheldon:** "Better than I did, honestly."
> 
> **Yosho:** "Children are resilient. And you have given him four years of safety before asking him to carry this."
> 
> **Sheldon:** "He asked if I was scared. When it happened."
> 
> **Yosho:** (pause) "What did you tell him?"
> 
> **Sheldon:** "The truth. That I was terrified. Until I found you."

A long silence. Something passes between them.

# PART 5: WHAT TENCHI NOW KNOWS

## 5.1 — Knowledge Inventory

| Topic | What Tenchi Knows | What He Doesn't Know |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Sheldon's nature** | "Different"; has abilities | Cosmic origin; Lambda; Cosmos |
| **How it happened** | "Something happened"; was hurt | Death; reincarnation; previous life |
| **Who helped** | "Something like a guardian angel" | Sailor Cosmos; full identity |
| **Sheldon's abilities** | Night vision, hearing, healing food, no sickness | Full extent; LHW potential |
| **Grandpa's involvement** | "Knows and helps train" | Yosho's true identity; Juraian heritage |
| **The secret** | Must hide from Dad and others | Why this is necessary |

## 5.2 — What's Age-Appropriate

Sheldon deliberately withheld:
- That he died (too frightening)
- That he's from another time (too confusing)
- That his benefactor is a goddess (too abstract)
- Anything about cosmic destiny (too heavy)
- Anything about Yosho's secrets (not his to tell)

What Tenchi received was truth, filtered for a child's understanding. Not lies. Simplification.

## 5.3 — Room to Grow

As Tenchi gets older, Sheldon can expand the truth:

| Age | Additional Truth |
|-----|------------------|
| 12-13 | "I lived before. This is my second life." |
| 15-16 | "The one who helped me is called Cosmos." |
| 17+ | Full truth (coincides with canon events) |

The framework is established. Details can be added as Tenchi matures.

---

# PART 6: THE AFTERMATH

## 6.1 — Immediate Changes

**The Next Morning:**

Tenchi watches Sheldon make breakfast with new appreciation. When Sheldon moves in the dim morning light without hesitation, Tenchi doesn't look away. When Sheldon hears the mail carrier coming before the gate opens, Tenchi just nods.

He's processing. Not freaking out. Processing.

**The First Week:**

| Day | Tenchi's Behavior |
|-----|------------------|
| 1 | Quiet; watching; thinking |
| 2 | Asks follow-up questions at breakfast |
| 3 | Tries to sneak up on Sheldon (fails; both laugh) |
| 4 | Asks if he can watch morning training |
| 5 | Returns to normal routine with subtle awareness |
| 6-7 | New normal established |

## 6.2 — Long-Term Impact

**On Tenchi:**

| Aspect | Before Revelation | After Revelation |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Trust in Sheldon | Complete | Complete + deeper |
| Understanding of household | Partial | Fuller |
| Sense of inclusion | Sometimes uncertain | Fully included |
| Burden of secret | None | Small but manageable |
| View of the world | Normal | "More is possible" |

**On Sheldon:**

| Aspect | Before Revelation | After Revelation |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Divided life | Exhausting | Unified |
| Relationship with Tenchi | Loving but guarded | Loving and honest |
| Guilt about deception | Constant | Relieved |
| Household dynamics | Compartmentalized | Integrated |

**On Yosho:**

He observes the change. Sheldon is lighter. Tenchi is more confident. The household feels more whole.

He also recognizes: Sheldon's honesty with Tenchi makes his own continued deception more glaring. But that revelation will wait. Tenchi is not ready for Jurai.

## 6.3 — Training Inclusion

After the revelation, Tenchi asks to watch morning training. Sheldon and Yosho discuss:

> **Yosho:** "He cannot participate. Not yet. He is not ready physically."
> 
> **Sheldon:** "But he could watch? Learn what discipline looks like?"
> 
> **Yosho:** "This would be... acceptable. Perhaps beneficial."

**Result:** Tenchi begins observing some training sessions. Not participating — just watching. Learning patience. Seeing what dedication looks like.

This lays groundwork for his own sword training (which intensifies in Years 5-6 anyway).

---

# PART 7: THE SECRET-KEEPING

## 7.1 — From Nobuyuki

**The Challenge:** Tenchi must keep this secret from his father.

**Why:** Nobuyuki is already fragile (Kiyone's death, weekend absences, guilt). Adding "the man raising your son has supernatural abilities" would be catastrophic.

**How Sheldon Frames It:**

> "Your dad has a lot on his mind. He worries about you, about work, about being a good father. If he knew about this, it would give him one more thing to worry about. And it wouldn't help him — it would just be scary. Can you help me protect him from that worry?"

Tenchi understands protecting Dad. He's been doing it instinctively for years — not complaining about weekend absences, not asking about Mom too often.

**Tenchi's Response:** "Okay. I can do that."

## 7.2 — From the Village

Easier. Tenchi barely talks to villagers about household matters anyway. He just... doesn't mention it.

## 7.3 — From Himself

The hardest part: Tenchi can't tell anyone. Not friends at school. Not anyone.

**How It's Managed:**

- Sheldon checks in regularly: "Is it hard not talking about it?"
- Tenchi is allowed to ask questions anytime at home
- He has Yosho and Sheldon as outlets
- The secret becomes shared treasure, not burden

# PART 8: SCENE SEEDS

## 8.1 — The Revelation Night

| Beat | Action | Emotional Core |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Tenchi catches Sheldon in dark kitchen | Discovery |
| 2 | Sheldon chooses honesty | Decision |
| 3 | "I can see in the dark" | First truth |
| 4 | Move to table; warm milk | Comfort; safety |
| 5 | Main conversation | Trust; vulnerability |
| 6 | "Can you show me something?" | Wonder |
| 7 | "Were you scared?" | Depth; connection |
| 8 | "I'm glad you told me" | Resolution |
| 9 | Tucking Tenchi back into bed | Return to normal with new understanding |

## 8.2 — Key Dialogue Moments

**The confession:**
> "I can see in the dark, Tenchi."

**The reframe:**
> "I'm still Sheldon. I'm still me. This doesn't change any of that."

**The child's wisdom:**
> "I don't like secrets."

**The promise:**
> "I'm not going anywhere."

**The secret-keeping request:**
> "Can you help me protect your dad from that worry?"

## 8.3 — Follow-Up Scenes (Days After)

| Scene | Core |
|-------|------|
| Tenchi trying to sneak up on Sheldon | Playful; testing; bonding |
| Tenchi watching morning training | Inclusion; discipline |
| Tenchi asking about the food warmth | Curiosity; wonder |
| Tenchi keeping secret from visiting Nobuyuki | Competence; protectiveness |
| Sheldon tucking Tenchi in, Tenchi whispering "I can keep secrets" | Trust affirmed |

---

# PART 9: IMPLICATIONS FOR YEARS 6-12

## 9.1 — Changed Dynamic

With Tenchi in the know, Years 6-12 are different:

| Aspect | Without Revelation | With Revelation |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Morning training | Hidden from Tenchi | Tenchi observes sometimes |
| Ability displays | Strictly suppressed | Relaxed at home |
| Conversations | Guarded | Open |
| Tenchi's questions | Deflected | Answered honestly |
| Household secrets | Two levels | One level |

## 9.2 — Tenchi's Growth (Informed by Knowledge)

| Year | Tenchi's Development |
|------|---------------------|
| 5 (8-9) | Learns truth; begins observing training |
| 6 (9-10) | Starts own sword training with Yosho; watches Sheldon |
| 7 (10-11) | Asks about Sheldon's origin; gets age-appropriate expansion |
| 8 (11-12) | Pre-adolescence; testing boundaries; truth provides anchor |
| 9-11 | Adolescence; secret becomes mark of maturity |
| 12 | Final "normal" year; full trust established |
| 13 | Canon begins; Tenchi handles it better because of foundation |

## 9.3 — Why Canon Tenchi Handles Things Better

Our Tenchi enters canon with:
- Four years of knowing Sheldon is "different"
- Experience keeping important secrets
- Understanding that the world is bigger than it seems
- Practice processing unusual information calmly
- A father figure who models honesty and trust

When Ryoko emerges, Tenchi doesn't collapse. He's been prepared — not for this specifically, but for the possibility that supernatural exists.

---

# PART 10: THE TRUST CHAIN

## 10.1 — Established Honesty Pattern

| Year | Revelation | From | To |
|------|------------|------|-----|
| 4 | Sheldon's nature | Sheldon | Yosho |
| 5 | Sheldon's nature (simplified) | Sheldon | Tenchi |
| 9-10? | Yosho's true form | Yosho | Sheldon |
| 13+ | Full truth | Sheldon | Tenchi |
| 13+ | Full truth | Yosho | Tenchi |

Each revelation builds on the last. Each creates deeper trust.

## 10.2 — What This Teaches Tenchi

By the time canon begins, Tenchi has learned:
- Adults can have secrets for good reasons
- Truth can be revealed in stages as you're ready
- Secrets shared are bonds, not burdens
- The people who love you will tell you when they can
- You don't need to know everything to trust someone

This makes him better equipped to handle:
- Yosho's Juraian identity reveal
- Sasami's Tsunami connection
- Washu's Chousin nature
- Everything else that comes
