## Phase Overview

**Timeline:** April 2001 onwards
**Trigger Event:** Tenchi releases Ryoko from the cave; canon begins
**Key Change:** Supernatural becomes normalized; all secrets revealed

---

## THE TRIGGER (Year 13)

### The Event
Tenchi, now 17, enters the forbidden cave and removes the Tenchi-ken sword, releasing Ryoko from her 700-year seal.

### Immediate Consequences
1. Ryoko attacks Tenchi (canon event)
2. Yosho intervenes, revealing his true abilities
3. Sheldon witnesses everything
4. The universe Sheldon has been living in finally makes sense

### Sheldon's Realization
"I've been in Tenchi Muyo this entire time."

The vague memories of watching the anime (dropped due to harem dynamics) suddenly have context. He finally recognizes:
- Where he is
- Who Katsuhito really is
- What the cave contained
- Why the tree felt sentient
