## 1.3 — June-August 1989: Summer Integration

### June: Rainy Season

**Weather:** Tsuyu (rainy season) brings challenges
- Shrine steps become slippery; Sheldon installs rope railings
- Indoor projects increase
- Tenchi's kindergarten has rainy-day activities
- Sheldon learns Japanese seasonal cooking (tsukemono, preserved foods)

**Milestone:** First time Sheldon cooks for a village event (small neighborhood gathering)
- Nervous; wants to impress but not overwhelm
- Success — "The American can cook!" becomes village knowledge
- Invitations to help with future events begin

### July: Tanabata and Summer

**Tanabata Festival (July 7):**
- Sheldon's first major Japanese festival participation
- Writes wishes on tanzaku (paper strips) with Tenchi
- Sheldon's wish (private): "Let me stay"
- Tenchi's wish: "I want Sheru-ji to stay forever"
- Katsuhito observes both wishes; says nothing

**Summer Begins:**
- Kindergarten summer break starts late July
- Tenchi is home full-time
- Sheldon becomes primary caregiver 24/7
- Challenge: Keeping energetic 5-year-old engaged

**Tsukino House Progress:**
- Sheldon begins serious restoration work
- Discovers house is structurally sound but neglected
- Makes it livable but doesn't move in yet
- Uses it as workshop/retreat space

### August: Obon

**Obon Festival (August 13-16):**

This is emotionally complex. Obon honors deceased ancestors. Sheldon's situation:
- His "ancestors" (the Tsukino family) are real to this universe
- But he has no actual memories of them
- Cosmos created a history, not a past he lived

**How Sheldon Handles It:**

He participates authentically in the rituals:
- Visits Tsukino family grave (first time)
- Lights lanterns, makes offerings
- Joins village Obon odori (dance)

**Internal Experience:**

Standing at the grave of "his mother" Yuki Tsukino, Sheldon feels:
- Gratitude (this history makes his presence possible)
- Grief (for his actual family in his previous life — Dorothy, his grandmother)
- Confusion (honoring people he never knew but who are "his")
- Acceptance (this is his life now; these are his ancestors now)

He doesn't cry. But he's quiet for days after.

**Katsuhito Notices:**

> "The first Obon is difficult for everyone who has lost someone."

He assumes Sheldon is grieving recent family deaths. He's not wrong, just not in the way he thinks.

## 1.4 — September-November 1989: Autumn Deepening

### September: School Resumes

- Tenchi returns to kindergarten (final year — nenchō)
- Sheldon attends first parent-teacher event as "family friend"
- Teacher privately asks Katsuhito: "Is the American... permanent?"
- Katsuhito: "He is family."
- Word spreads. Acceptance deepens.

**Repair Business Begins:**

Tanaka-san's cash register breaks. Sheldon fixes it in an afternoon.
- Word spreads: "The American fixes things"
- Requests begin: appliances, small machinery, electronics
- Sheldon doesn't charge money — accepts food, favors, goodwill
- By month's end, he has informal reputation as village repairman

### October: Harvest and Preparation

**Village Harvest Festival:**
- Sheldon participates in rice harvest (first time)
- Physical labor is easy for him (Phase I enhancement)
- Villagers notice he doesn't tire like others
- Explanation accepted: "Young and fit"

**Relationship with Nobuyuki:**

Nobuyuki visits most weekends now. The dynamic:
- Grateful that Tenchi is thriving
- Slightly uncomfortable that a stranger is raising his son
- Impressed by Sheldon's competence
- Relieved he doesn't have to worry

**Key Conversation (October):**

Nobuyuki, slightly drunk after dinner:
> "I should be here more. I should be doing what you do."

Sheldon:
> "You're doing what you need to do to provide for him. And you're here every weekend. That matters."

Nobuyuki:
> "He talks about you constantly. 'Sheru-ji said this, Sheru-ji made that.'"

Sheldon:
> "He talks about you too. 'When is Dad coming? Can we show Dad?'"

This is the moment Nobuyuki stops seeing Sheldon as competition and starts seeing him as partner.

### November: Seven-Five-Three

**Shichi-Go-San (November 15):**

Tenchi is 5 — this is his Shichi-Go-San year. The ceremony:
- Traditional clothing (hakama for boys)
- Shrine visit for blessing
- Chitose-ame (thousand-year candy)
- Family photographs

**Who Attends:**
- Katsuhito (officiates as priest)
- Nobuyuki (takes day off work)
- Sheldon (present but uncertain of his role)

**The Moment:**

During photographs, Tenchi grabs Sheldon's hand and pulls him into the frame.
> "Sheru-ji too!"

Nobuyuki hesitates. Katsuhito nods.

The photograph: Three generations of Masaki men, plus Sheldon.

Sheldon keeps a copy in his room. It's the first evidence he belongs.

## 1.5 — December 1989: First Dream-Contact

### The Month

**New Year Preparations:**
- Shrine is busy: shimenawa (sacred rope), kadomatsu (pine decorations)
- Sheldon learns Shinto rituals by observation
- Katsuhito begins teaching him basic prayers
- Village prepares for Ōmisoka (New Year's Eve)

**Tenchi's First Christmas:**

Sheldon quietly introduces Christmas concepts (his American heritage):
- Not religious — cultural
- Small gifts exchanged
- Tenchi delighted by the novelty
- Katsuhito tolerates it with dry amusement
- Becomes annual tradition

### The Dream (Late December)

**Setting:** Sheldon falls asleep on December 30th, exhausted from preparations.

**The Dream-Space:**

Silver light. Warmth. A presence.

He can't see her clearly — more impression than image. But he knows:
- She's female
- She's immensely powerful
- She loves him
- She's been watching

**The "Conversation":**

Not words exactly. Impressions. Feelings. Understanding.

What Sheldon Receives:
- Confirmation that he's where he's supposed to be
- Approval of how he's handled the first year
- Warmth — maternal, protective, proud
- A sense of "more to come" without specifics

What Sheldon Doesn't Receive:
- Her name
- Explanation of what he is
- Details about his abilities
- Information about the future

**Sheldon's Response:**

He wakes with tears on his face. Not sad — overwhelmed.

For the first time since arrival, he's certain: this wasn't random. He was chosen. He matters.

He doesn't tell anyone about the dream.

### New Year's Eve (Ōmisoka)

**The Night:**
- Shrine busy with visitors
- Joya-no-kane (108 bell tolls at midnight)
- Sheldon helps serve amazake (sweet sake) to visitors
- First Hatsumode (New Year shrine visit) the next morning

**Internal State:**

As the bells toll, Sheldon stands on the shrine steps, looking down at the village below. Eight months ago, he climbed these steps a stranger. Now:
- He has a home
- He has a family
- He has purpose
- He has been acknowledged by... whatever she is

Year 1 is complete.

# PART 2: YEAR 2 — THE SETTLING YEAR (1990)

- Tenchi is happy, healthy, thriving
- Sheldon and Katsuhito work together seamlessly
- Nobuyuki feels... peripheral

**Private Conversation (Nobuyuki to Katsuhito):**

> "He's better at this than I would be."

Katsuhito:
> "Perhaps. But you are his father. That cannot be replaced."

### February-March: Kindergarten Graduation

**The Ceremony:**

Sheldon attends as "family friend" (still the official designation).
- Tenchi sings, bows, receives diploma
- Searches the crowd for familiar faces

### Summer: Routine Solidification

**Sheldon's Days:**

With Tenchi in school longer, Sheldon has more independent time:

|----------|------------|
| Shrine maintenance | 10 |
| Tsukino house (workshop) | 15 |
| Village repair work | 8 |
| Personal projects | 5 |
| Cooking/household | 20+ |

## 2.4 — September 1990 - March 1991: Full Integration

By autumn Year 2, Sheldon's position is clear:

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Village opinion | "The American who lives at the shrine" — accepted |
| Shrine role | Unofficial assistant; handles daily maintenance |
| Tenchi's care | Primary daytime caregiver |
| Repair business | Established; steady informal income |
| Social position | "Family friend" officially; family actually |

**Dream Contact (December 1990):**

Brief touch. Same warmth. Same approval. No new information.

# PART 3: YEAR 3 — THE BELONGING YEAR (1991)

## 3.1 — Overview

Year 3 is when "stranger" becomes impossible. Sheldon has been at the shrine longer than Tenchi has clear memories. For the boy, there was never a time without Sheru-ji.

## 3.2 — Significant Moments

### The Fever (Spring 1991)

Tenchi catches a bad cold that becomes fever. Three days of misery.

**Sheldon's Response:**
- Doesn't sleep
- Cooks healing foods
- Stays by Tenchi's bedside

**Katsuhito's Observation:**

Finding Sheldon asleep in a chair beside Tenchi's futon:
> (to himself) "He is the boy's father in every way that matters."

### The Schoolyard Incident (Summer 1991)

An older child teases Tenchi: "Where's your mom? The weird American isn't your mom."

Tenchi's response (age 7): Punches the kid.

**The Conversation:**

Sheldon doesn't scold. He asks:
> "What did he say?"

Tenchi, still angry:
> "He said you weren't my family!"

Sheldon:
> "I am your family. And I'm proud you defended us. But next time, try words first."

### The Question (Autumn 1991)

Tenchi asks: "Is Sheru-ji going to leave?"

**Sheldon's Response:**

> "Tenchi, I'm not going anywhere. This is my home now. You and Grandpa are my family."

> "Promise?"

> "I promise."

### The Village Whispers (Winter 1991-92)

By late Year 3, some villagers have noticed:
- Sheldon doesn't seem to age
- He's never been sick
- There's something "different" about him

**Overheard Conversation:**

Two older women at the market:
> "There's something about him..."
> "There's something about the shrine. Always has been. We don't talk about it."
> "No. We don't."

The village protective conspiracy begins.

## 3.3 — Year 3 Ending: Precursor to Revelation

**Dream Contact (December 1991):**

Stronger than previous years. The presence is clearer:
- A sense of "readiness"
- Encouragement
- "It's time to take another step"

Sheldon wakes knowing: Year 4 will be different.
