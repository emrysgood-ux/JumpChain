# PRIORITY ORDER FOR FILLING GAPS

**Tier 1 (Story-Critical):**
1. Gap C: Year 4 Revelation — this defines the entire Sheldon-Yosho relationship
2. Gap F: Year 13 Canon Recognition — pivotal character moment
3. Gap G: Wedding & Marriage Establishment — defines second half of story

**Tier 2 (Character Development):**
4. Gap D-E: Years 5-12 — Tenchi's childhood, Sheldon as father figure
5. Gap A-B: Years 1-3 — Foundation building

**Tier 3 (World-Building):**
6. Gap H: Specific scenes (can be slotted in as needed)

---

# RECOMMENDED APPROACH

For each gap, we should establish:
1. **Key events** — what happens
2. **Relationship milestones** — how bonds develop
3. **Domestic details** — daily life texture
4. **External factors** — village, Japan, world events
5. **Cosmos-related** — any communication/grants/revelations
6. **Scene seeds** — specific moments to write later
