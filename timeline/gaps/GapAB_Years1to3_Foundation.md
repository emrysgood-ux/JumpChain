# GAPS A-B: YEARS 1-3 — THE FOUNDATION
## Son of Cosmos: Building a Life from Nothing
## Compiled December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

**Period:** Years 1-3 (April 1989 - March 1992)
**Tenchi's Age:** 4→7 (Kindergarten → Elementary 1st Grade)
**Sheldon's Apparent Age:** 22-25 (subtle aging, not noticed yet)
**Status:** Pre-revelation; Sheldon and Yosho still in "employer/employee" dynamic

These are the years Sheldon transforms from "mysterious stranger" to "part of the family." No cosmic revelations, no dramatic confrontations — just daily life building trust one meal at a time.

## 1.2 — First Projects (June-August)

### Project 1: Kitchen Improvement
**Timeline:** June 1989
**Scope:** Reorganizing the Masaki house kitchen for efficiency
**What He Does:**
- Rearranges storage for workflow
- Installs simple shelving
- Creates dedicated prep area
- Improves ventilation (with Yosho's permission)

**Significance:** First visible improvement. Yosho notices the kitchen works better. Says nothing. Watches.

### Project 2: Tenchi's Study Space
**Timeline:** July 1989
**Scope:** Preparing for Tenchi's upcoming elementary school
**What He Does:**
- Sets up a desk in Tenchi's room
- Organizes supplies
- Creates a reading corner
- Installs better lighting

**Significance:** First project specifically for Tenchi. The boy is thrilled.

### Project 3: Guest Room Workshop
**Timeline:** August 1989
**Scope:** Converting part of his quarters into a small workspace
**What He Does:**
- Organizes tools
- Creates a basic workbench
- Starts collecting materials
- Keeps it neat (small space discipline)

**Significance:** Foundation for later repair business.

## 1.3 — Village Integration (Summer 1989)

### First Village Interactions:

**The Hardware Store:**
- Owner: Tanaka Hiroshi (hardware store)
- First visit: June, buying supplies
- Pattern: Weekly visits, brief conversations
- By August: Tanaka nods when Sheldon enters. Progress.

**The Convenience Store:**
- Clerk: Usually bored teenager
- Sheldon is polite, quiet, doesn't linger
- Noticed as "the American at the shrine"

**The Vegetable Stand:**
- Owner: Elderly woman (Obaa-san, name learned later)
- Sheldon's Japanese improves through these transactions
- She starts setting aside good produce for him
- First genuine village relationship

### Village Opinion (Summer 1989):

**What They Think:**
- "Polite for a foreigner"
- "Helps at the shrine — that's good"
- "Quiet. Keeps to himself."
- "Good with the Masaki boy"
- "Wonder how long he'll stay"

**What They Don't Know:**
- Anything about his past
- Why he's really there
- That he's not aging normally

## 1.4 — Obon (August 1989)

### The First Ancestor Festival:

**Date:** August 13-15, 1989
**Significance:** First time Sheldon participates in honoring "his" ancestors

**The Problem:**
Sheldon is supposed to have a Tsukino family history. There are graves in the village cemetery. He's never visited them.

**What He Does:**
- Asks Yosho how to properly observe Obon
- Visits the Tsukino family graves for the first time
- Finds: Takeo (grandfather he never met), Hana (great-grandmother)
- Performs the rituals correctly (Yosho's instruction)
- Feels nothing for people who never existed

**Internal Moment:**
Standing before graves of fictional ancestors, Sheldon thinks about his REAL family. His grandmother Dorothy Mae, who raised him. His parents, dead when he was 10. 

He can't honor them here. No graves. No records. They exist only in his memory.

He performs the Tsukino rituals perfectly. Inside, he's mourning alone.

**Significance:** First hint of the isolation beneath his competent exterior.

## 1.5 — First Dream-Contact with Cosmos (December 1989)

### The Dream:

**Date:** December 31, 1989 (New Year's Eve)
**Setting:** After evening preparations, Sheldon falls asleep on the shrine porch

**The Dream-Space:**
A garden that exists nowhere. Silver light instead of sun. Flowers that might be stars.

She's waiting for him.

Silver hair. White robes. A face that's familiar even though he's never seen it clearly. Kindness that radiates like warmth.

**The Conversation:**

> **COSMOS:** "You've done well, my son."

> **SHELDON:** "I don't understand what I'm supposed to do."

> **COSMOS:** "You're doing it. You're living."

> **SHELDON:** "That's it? Just... live?"

> **COSMOS:** "For now. The rest will come when it's needed."

> **SHELDON:** "Why here? Why this place?"

> **COSMOS:** "Because this place needed you. And you needed a place."

> **SHELDON:** "That's not an answer."

> **COSMOS:** (smiling) "It's the only one I can give you yet. Trust the process. Trust yourself. Trust the family you're building."

> **SHELDON:** "I'm not building a family. I'm a hired hand."

> **COSMOS:** "Are you?"

**He Wakes:**
New Year's bells are ringing. The year changes from 1989 to 1990.

He's crying and doesn't know why.

**Significance:** First confirmation that Cosmos is watching. First instruction (however vague). First emotional break in Sheldon's composed exterior.

## 1.6 — Year 1 Summary

**By March 1990, Sheldon has:**
- Established daily routine
- Completed three improvement projects
- Begun village integration
- Survived first Obon (emotionally complicated)
- Had first dream-contact with Cosmos
- Become genuinely attached to Tenchi
- Earned Yosho's continued trust (but not full truth)

**Relationship Status:**
- Yosho: Employer who respects him; watching, evaluating
- Tenchi: The small boy who's claimed Sheldon as his person
- Village: "The American" — accepted but not integrated
- Cosmos: Distant presence, watching but not directing

---

# PART 2: YEAR 2 (April 1990 - March 1991)

## 2.1 — Tenchi Starts Elementary School

### Date: April 1990
### Grade: Elementary 1st Grade (Age 6)

**The Morning Routine Changes:**
- Earlier wake-up
- Packed lunch (Sheldon makes bento)
- Walk to school (longer than kindergarten route)
- Sheldon walks him the first month, then watches from afar, then lets go

**The Bento:**
Sheldon's bentos become known among the mothers. "The shrine boy has the best lunch." Word spreads. Some mothers ask for tips.

This is Sheldon's first genuine village connection: food.

### First Parent-Teacher Meeting:

**Problem:** Sheldon isn't Tenchi's parent. Nobuyuki is, but he works in Tokyo.
**Solution:** Yosho attends as guardian. Sheldon hovers nearby.

**What the Teacher Says:**
- Tenchi is bright, attentive
- Very polite (Sheldon's influence)
- Sometimes talks about his "Sheldon-san"
- The teacher is confused about the household structure

**What Yosho Says:**
"Sheldon-san is a family friend who helps with Tenchi's care while my grandson works in Tokyo."

This becomes the official story.

## 2.2 — The Repair Business Begins

### Summer 1990:

**The Catalyst:**
A village elder's radio breaks. No repair shop nearby. Village hardware store owner mentions "the American at the shrine is good with his hands."

**First Job:**
Sheldon fixes the radio. Refuses payment. The elder insists on leaving vegetables.

**Second Job:**
Word spreads. A bicycle needs fixing. Then a sewing machine. Then a generator.

**By Fall 1990:**
Sheldon has unofficial "repair hours" — Saturday afternoons at the shrine. People bring things. He fixes them. They leave gifts (food, supplies, occasionally money).

**Significance:**
- Creates village role beyond "shrine helper"
- Establishes expertise and usefulness
- Builds relationships through service
- Provides modest income

### The Tsukino Property Question:

**The Problem:**
Sheldon supposedly inherited a house and shop in the village. He's never gone there.

**Year 2 Resolution:**
- Visits the property (finally)
- Finds: abandoned house, overgrown, needs work
- Decides to leave it for now (no time, no need)
- Pays property taxes through bank account (Cosmos set up)
- Will become relevant later (moves there Day 17+ per established story)

## 2.3 — Deepening Routines

### Shrine Life Rhythms:

By Year 2, Sheldon knows:
- When the shrine gets visitors (festivals, New Year, occasional tourists)
- What ceremonies require preparation
- How to assist without intruding
- Yosho's moods and rhythms

### The Evening Tea:

**New Routine (started Fall 1990):**
After Tenchi goes to bed, Yosho sometimes invites Sheldon for tea.

These are NOT revelation conversations (that's Year 4). These are:
- Discussing Tenchi's progress
- Shrine business
- Quiet company
- Two lonely men sitting together

**Significance:** Foundation for later intimacy. They're learning to be comfortable in silence.

## 2.4 — First Full Festival Participation (Autumn 1990)

### The Autumn Festival:

**Date:** November 1990
**Event:** Shrine autumn festival (harvest thanksgiving)

**Sheldon's Role:**
- Helps with preparation (weeks of work)
- Assists during ceremony (background, invisible work)
- Manages food for visitors (his domain)
- Cleans up after

**Village Reaction:**
People see him working. They see him competent. They see him part of the shrine.

"He's not leaving, is he? The American. He's staying."

**Yosho's Response (to villager question):**
"Sheldon-san has become part of this shrine. I hope he stays as long as he wishes."

This is the first time Yosho publicly claims Sheldon as belonging.

## 2.5 — Year 2 Summary

**By March 1991, Sheldon has:**
- Navigated Tenchi starting school
- Started the repair business
- Participated in major shrine festival
- Established evening tea routine with Yosho
- Been publicly acknowledged as "part of the shrine"

**Changes from Year 1:**
- More confident in daily life
- Known in village (positively)
- Relationship with Yosho warming
- More comfortable as Tenchi's caretaker

---

# PART 3: YEAR 3 (April 1991 - March 1992)

## 3.1 — Settling into Stability

Year 3 is the year where "new" becomes "normal."

**What's Routine Now:**
- Tenchi's school schedule
- Shrine duties
- Repair business
- Village relationships
- Evening tea with Yosho

**What's Still Developing:**
- Sheldon's Japanese (now fluent, but accent remains)
- Village trust (accepted, not quite "one of us")
- Understanding of Yosho (knows he's hiding something)

## 3.2 — Tenchi's Questions Begin

### Age 7 Curiosity:

**About His Mother:**
> "Sheldon-san, did you know my mama?"

Sheldon didn't. Kiyone died before he arrived. But Tenchi doesn't know this timeline perfectly.

> "No, Tenchi. But I know she loved you very much. Your grandfather tells me that."

**About Sheldon:**
> "Why don't you have a family, Sheldon-san?"

This hurts more than the child knows.

> "I had one, once. They're... not here anymore."

Tenchi accepts this with child's simple compassion. Hugs Sheldon. Moves on.

Sheldon does not cry in front of the child. Later, alone, is different.

**About Grandpa:**
> "Why does Grandpa look old but doesn't act old?"

Sheldon has no answer for this. Neither does Tenchi. It's filed away as "mysterious grandfather things."

## 3.3 — The Kiyoshi Question

### Uncle Kiyoshi (Still Alive in Osaka)

**The Problem:**
Sheldon has a living "uncle" who remembers him. He's been in Japan three years without visiting.

**Year 3 Decision:**
- Sheldon writes a letter (first contact)
- Explains he's "settled at a shrine, helping a family"
- Promises to visit "when time permits"
- Receives warm reply from Kiyoshi

**What This Establishes:**
- The family relationship is REAL (Cosmos made it real)
- Sheldon is avoiding deeper contact (discomfort with his memory gap — he can't recall meeting them)
- Eventually he'll have to face building real connections
- For now: letters suffice

### First Phone Call (Winter 1991):

**Kiyoshi calls the shrine.**

> "Nephew? Is that you? Your letter said you're at a shrine?"

Sheldon's voice matches what Kiyoshi remembers (Cosmos's consistency). The conversation is awkward but warm. Kiyoshi doesn't push. Sheldon promises to visit "soon."

He doesn't visit in Year 3. Or Year 4. Eventually, but not yet.

## 3.4 — Pre-Revelation Signs

### Sheldon's Abilities Emerge:

Throughout Year 3, small things happen:
- He finishes repairs faster than should be possible
- His cooking is consistently exceptional (beyond skill)
- He never gets sick
- He heals from cuts unusually fast
- He occasionally knows where things are without looking

**Yosho Notices:**
The old priest watches. Says nothing. But his evaluating gaze intensifies.

### The Almost-Incident (March 1992):

**What Happens:**
Late night. Strange noise near the shrine. Sheldon investigates. It's nothing — a deer.

But for a moment, in the darkness, Sheldon SAW clearly. Too clearly. Before his eyes adjusted.

He doesn't think about it. Files it away. But it's there. Waiting for Year 4's storm.

## 3.5 — Year 3 Summary

**By March 1992, Sheldon has:**
- Fully integrated into shrine life
- Handled Tenchi's early childhood questions
- Made first contact with Kiyoshi (letters)
- Begun exhibiting subtle abilities
- Become comfortable enough to stop noticing he's comfortable

**The Stage is Set:**
Year 4 will shatter this stability. The revelation scene will change everything. But Year 3 ends in peace.

The last quiet year.
