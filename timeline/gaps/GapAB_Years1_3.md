**Tenchi's Age:** 5-7 (Kindergarten through Elementary 2nd Grade)

# PART 1: YEAR 1 EXPANSION (May-December 1989)

## 1.1 — What Day 1-28 Established

By the end of April 1989 (the 28 days we have detailed), Sheldon has:
- Arrived and integrated into shrine life
- Become Tenchi's primary caretaker
- Earned Yosho's cautious approval

- Living between shrine and village house

**Tenchi relationship:**

**Yosho relationship:**
- Employer/employee dynamic settling

## 1.3 — June 1989: The Garden

**Focus:** Contributing to the household physically

**Key project:** Sheldon improves the shrine garden
- Weeding, replanting, organizing
- Uses enhanced abilities subtly (lifting, precision)
- Result: Garden flourishes (Lambda Infusion at work)

**Village reaction:**
- "The American has a green thumb"
- First positive village gossip

**Tenchi involvement:**
- Tenchi "helps" with garden
- First teaching moments (plants, growth, patience)
- Bonding through shared work

## 1.4 — July 1989: First Tanabata

**Date:** July 7, 1989
**Event:** Tanabata festival (Star Festival)

**Significance:** First village festival where Sheldon participates

**Activities:**
- Writing wishes on tanzaku (paper strips)
- Hanging on bamboo
- Festival food, games, fireworks
- Tenchi excited; Sheldon experiences Japanese tradition

**Sheldon's wish:** (Written in careful Japanese)
> "To be worthy of this second chance."

**Tenchi's wish:**
> "For Sheldon-san to stay forever."

Sheldon doesn't see this until later. When he does, his heart breaks a little.

## 1.5 — August 1989: Obon and Truth

**Event:** Obon (Festival of the Dead, August 13-15)

**Significance:** Honoring ancestors — but Sheldon's "ancestors" never existed

**The ritual:**
- Visiting graves (Tsukino family plot)
- Cleaning, offerings, prayers
- Village communal observance

**Sheldon's internal conflict:**
> *These aren't my ancestors. These people never existed until Cosmos made them exist.*
>
> *But they exist now. The records are real. Kiyoshi remembers them.*
>
> *What does that make them? What does that make me?*

**Resolution:** He honors them anyway. They're as real as he is.

**First contact with Uncle Kiyoshi:**
- Sheldon writes a letter to Osaka
- Formally introduces himself
- Expresses gratitude for family connection
- Kiyoshi responds with warmth

## 1.6 — September 1989: School Year Begins

**Event:** Tenchi enters final year of kindergarten

**Sheldon's role:**
- Morning preparation (breakfast, clothes, lunch)
- Walking Tenchi to the road (bus pickup)
- Afternoon greeting when bus returns
- Homework help (age-appropriate)

**Yosho observes:** Sheldon is better with Tenchi than Nobuyuki. Present. Patient. Consistent.

## 1.7 — October 1989: First Shrine Festival

**Event:** Autumn shrine festival (major annual event)

**Sheldon's role:**
- Helping with preparation (physical labor)
- Cooking for crowds (reputation grows)
- Managing logistics
- First time villagers see him as "shrine staff"

**Key moment:** An elderly villager calls him "Shrine-san" (shrinekeeper). First title beyond "the American."

## 1.8 — November 1989: The Repair Shop Opens

**Event:** Tsukino house renovated enough to use as workshop

**Business established:**
- Word of mouth from shrine contacts
- Small electronics, household items
- Fair prices, exceptional quality
- Starts slow; grows steadily

**Income implications:**
- No longer entirely dependent on shrine
- Can contribute to household expenses
- Independence without separation

## 1.9 — December 1989: First New Year Prep

**Events:** 
- Ōmisoka (New Year's Eve)
- Preparing shrine for first visitors (hatsumode)
- Major cleaning, decorating
- Food preparation (massive undertaking)

**The workload:** Sheldon throws himself into preparation. Works alongside Yosho for days. By the end, they're moving in sync — no words needed.

**FIRST DREAM-CONTACT WITH COSMOS:**

New Year's Eve, after exhausted sleep:

> *The dream is silver. A presence he can't see but knows.*
>
> COSMOS: "You are doing well."
>
> SHELDON: "Who are you?"
>
> COSMOS: "The one who gave you this chance."
>
> SHELDON: "Why?"
>
> COSMOS: "Because you were worth saving."
>
> *He wants to ask more. The dream dissolves.*
>
> *He wakes remembering only warmth and the certainty that someone is watching.*

He doesn't remember the words. Just the feeling: I am not alone.

## 3.1 — Overview

**Tenchi's age:** 6-7 (Elementary 1st → 2nd Grade)
**Theme:** Deep integration; preparing for revelation

## 3.2 — Key Events

### Routine Perfection

By Year 3, the household runs smoothly:
- No one remembers how things worked before Sheldon
- His cooking is expected, not remarkable
- His presence at events is assumed
- The household is a unit

### Nobuyuki's Gratitude

Nobuyuki pulls Sheldon aside:

> "I never thanked you properly."
>
> "For what?"
>
> "For being here. For my son. For my father. You've given them something I couldn't."
>
> "I just... do what needs doing."
>
> "That's what I mean. Thank you."

### Repair Business Thriving

**Client base:**
- Village residents (regular)
- Nearby town customers (growing)
- Reputation for "fixing anything"
- Income stable and growing

### Sheldon's Workshop/Lab

**Development:** The Tsukino house basement becomes a hidden lab
- Electronics projects beyond repair work
- Early experiments with his abilities
- Place to think, build, explore

### Pre-Revelation Tensions

**Signs building:**
- Sheldon's control slipping occasionally
- Enhanced senses harder to mask under stress
- Yosho noticing more anomalies
- Something must give

### The Incident That Leads to Year 4

**Late Year 3 setup:**
- Multiple small slips (seeing in low light, reflexes too fast)
- Yosho cataloguing each one
- Both know a conversation is coming
- Neither initiates yet

**Ends on tension:** By March 1992, both Sheldon and Yosho know the status quo can't hold. Year 4's revelation is inevitable.

# PART 6: FIRST COSMOS CONTACT (EXPANDED)

## 6.1 — The Dream (December 31, 1989)

**Setting:** New Year's Eve, after exhausting shrine preparation, deep sleep

**The experience:**

> *Silver light. Not blinding — suffusing. Like standing inside a star.*
>
> *A presence. Female, but beyond female. Ancient, but not old.*
>
> *He can't see her. He knows she's there.*
>
> "You are doing well."
>
> *Her voice is his mother's voice, and his grandmother's, and every kind voice he's ever heard.*
>
> "Who are you?"
>
> "The one who chose you."
>
> "Why? Why me?"
>
> "Because you needed a family. And they needed you."
>
> "That's not an answer."
>
> *Amusement. Warmth.*
>
> "You're right. It's not. But it's all I can give you now."
>
> "Will you tell me more? Eventually?"
>
> "When you're ready."
>
> *The light begins to fade.*
>
> "Wait—"
>
> "Be patient, my son. You're learning patience. That was always the hardest lesson for me too."
>
> *Gone.*

## 6.2 — What Sheldon Remembers

When he wakes:
- Warmth
- Being watched (benevolently)
- The phrase "my son" (though he can't place why)
- A sense of purpose without specifics

He does NOT remember:
- Her words verbatim
- That she called herself the one who chose him
- Any identifying details

The memory fog is intentional. Cosmos gives comfort, not answers.

## 6.3 — Impact

For the next weeks, Sheldon feels:
- Less alone
- More certain he's supposed to be here
- That someone, somewhere, cares about him

He doesn't try to analyze it. He accepts it.
