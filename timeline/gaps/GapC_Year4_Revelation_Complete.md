**Timeline Context:**
- Tenchi is 7-8 years old (2nd grade)
- Sheldon has been at the shrine for 3+ years
- Routines are established, trust is built
- Sheldon has been actively suppressing abilities

---

# PART 1: THE BUILDUP (January-Summer 1992)

## 1.1 — Sheldon's Growing Problem

By Year 4, Sheldon's Phase II abilities are becoming harder to hide:

| Ability | How It's Manifesting | Natural Explanation Failing |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Enhanced Senses** | Sees clearly in near-darkness; hears conversations from far away | "Good eyes" doesn't explain reading in moonlight |
| **Physical Optimization** | Never sick; heals faster than normal | Three years without a cold while village has flu outbreaks |
| **Infinite Pantry** | Always has the right ingredient | Coincidence becomes pattern |
| **Lambda Infusion** | Food has measurable effect on mood | Yosho has noticed the "warmth" in the cooking |

**Internal Conflict:**
Sheldon has been lying by omission to the man who gave him a home, who trusts him with his grandson. Three years of daily proximity. Three years of watching Yosho watch him with those sharp, ancient eyes.

*He knows Yosho suspects something. He's seen the old priest's gaze linger when Sheldon navigates the shrine at night without a lantern, when he catches words spoken across the courtyard, when his cuts from carpentry work are healed by morning.*

## 1.2 — Yosho's Growing Certainty

Yosho, a 700-year-old Juraian prince, has been observing Sheldon since Day 1. By Year 4, he's certain:

**What Yosho Has Noticed:**
- Sheldon's energy signature is unlike anything in his experience
- The food carries something — not Juraian, not human, something *else*
- Sheldon's physical capabilities exceed any normal human
- The man is clearly hiding what he can do

**What Yosho Has NOT Determined:**
- What Sheldon actually is
- Where his abilities come from
- Whether he's a threat

**Yosho's Dilemma:**
He can't force the issue without revealing his own secrets. And Sheldon has been nothing but beneficial — caring for Tenchi, maintaining the shrine, bringing warmth back to a home that had grown cold. Whatever Sheldon is, his *actions* have been consistently good.

## 1.3 — The Pressure Builds

**Late Spring 1992:**

Small incidents accumulate:

1. **The Storm Night:** Power goes out during a thunderstorm. Yosho finds Sheldon moving through the dark kitchen with perfect confidence, assembling dinner by touch and moonlight. When questioned, Sheldon's pause is a beat too long before saying "good night vision."

2. **The Fever Season:** A nasty flu sweeps through the village. Tenchi catches it, recovers quickly (Sheldon's cooking). Nobuyuki catches it, recovers normally. The shopkeeper, the fishmonger, half the children — all sick. Sheldon never so much as sniffles.

3. **The Overheard Conversation:** Yosho is on the phone with someone in the village. Sheldon, in the kitchen, responds to something said — then freezes when he realizes Yosho wasn't speaking loudly enough to be heard from that distance.

**The Weight:**
Sheldon is tired of hiding. He's been lying to a man he respects, in a home that has become *his* home, caring for a child who has become *his* child. The deception is corrosive.

# PART 2: THE TRIGGER INCIDENT

## 2.1 — The Night (Late June 1992)

**Setting:** 
A warm evening. Tenchi is staying overnight at a friend's house in the village. Nobuyuki is in Tokyo for work. For the first time in months, Sheldon and Yosho are alone at the shrine.

**The Setup:**
After dinner, Yosho asks Sheldon to help him retrieve something from the storage building — an old ceremonial item needed for the upcoming summer festival. The storage building has no electricity. The sun has set. There is no moon.

**The Moment:**

Yosho: "I'll get a lantern."

Sheldon: "I can see fine."

*And then he's already walking toward the storage building, navigating in darkness that should be absolute, and he doesn't realize what he's done until he hears Yosho's footsteps stop behind him.*

**The Pause:**

Sheldon stops. Turns. In the darkness, he can see Yosho perfectly — the old priest standing still, head slightly tilted, those sharp eyes fixed on him with an expression that is not surprise. It's *confirmation*.

Yosho, very quietly: "Come back to the porch. We should talk."

## 2.2 — Sheldon's Choice

Sheldon could:
- Continue the pretense ("What do you mean?")
- Deflect ("My eyes adjusted quickly")
- Minimize ("It's not that dark")

But three years of trust, three years of this man's home, three years of caring for his grandson—

Sheldon walks back to the porch.

# PART 3: THE CONVERSATION

## 3.1 — Setting the Scene

**Location:** The shrine porch, overlooking the steps and the lake below
**Time:** Full night, stars visible, cicadas singing
**Atmosphere:** Warm summer air, the smell of cedar, distant sound of the lake

They sit in their usual spots. Yosho does not light a lantern. The darkness is statement enough.

A long silence.

Then Yosho speaks.

## 3.2 — Yosho's Opening

"I have watched you for three years, Sheldon Carter. I have seen you do things no ordinary man can do."

Pause.

"You see in darkness. You hear what should not be heard. You have not been sick a single day since you arrived. Your cooking..." A slight shake of his head. "Your cooking does something I cannot explain."

Pause.

"You have been hiding. Poorly, toward the end. And I have been waiting."

His eyes, ancient and patient, fix on Sheldon.

"I think it is time you told me what you are."

## 3.3 — Sheldon's Response

**The Opening:**

Sheldon's hands rest on his knees. He looks out at the darkness — the lake he can see clearly, the stars reflected on water Yosho probably can't distinguish.

"I don't know what I am."

The words come slowly at first. Then faster.

**The Truth:**

"I died. In my previous life, I was a physicist. Thirty-eight years old. I was working on an experiment, and something went wrong, and I died."

Pause.

"And then I woke up. In a field. Near here. With this body, and these abilities, and documents saying I was someone's nephew who had inherited a house in the village."

He doesn't look at Yosho.

"Someone — something — gave me this. A second chance. A new life. I don't know who. I don't know why. I just know that I woke up, and I walked here, and I climbed your steps, and everything since then has been... real."

## 3.4 — What Sheldon Tells Yosho

| Topic | What He Says | What He Doesn't Say |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **His death** | "I died in an accident at 38" | The year was 2025; particle accelerator details |
| **His resurrection** | "Someone gave me this chance" | Cosmos; Lambda; any specifics |
| **His abilities** | "I can see in the dark, hear far away, heal fast" | The full extent; the cooking's cosmic nature |
| **His knowledge** | "I don't understand what I am" | True — he genuinely doesn't know |
| **His intentions** | "I just want to live. To help. To matter." | True — this is his core motivation |

**What Sheldon Does NOT Reveal:**
- He refers to his savior only as "someone" or "something"
- He doesn't mention dreams or communication
- He downplays the extent of his abilities
- He is genuinely uncertain about most things

## 3.5 — Yosho's Response

**The Listening:**

Throughout Sheldon's explanation, Yosho does not interrupt. Does not react visibly. Simply listens with the patience of seven centuries.

When Sheldon finishes, silence returns.

**The Response:**

"You are telling me the truth."

It's not a question.

"I have known many liars in my life, Sheldon. Many who hid what they were. You are hiding — but you are not lying. You genuinely do not know what brought you here."

Pause.

"I believe you."

**The Offer:**

"I can help you understand your abilities. Train you to control them, to use them safely." His voice is calm, measured. "I have some experience with... unusual circumstances."

A slight, dry humor enters his tone.

"You are not the strangest thing I have encountered."

## 3.6 — What Yosho Does NOT Reveal

| Topic | What He Keeps Secret | Why |
|-------|---------------------|-----|
| **His identity** | He is Yosho Masaki Jurai, Crown Prince | Revealing this risks everything |
| **His age** | He is ~700 years old | Would require explaining Jurai |
| **The tree** | Funaho-no-ki is his Royal Tree | Same |
| **The cave** | Ryoko is sealed there | Tenchi's safety |
| **His true form** | He appears elderly by choice | Not yet earned |
| **His suspicions** | He has theories about Sheldon's nature | Incomplete; might be wrong |

**Yosho's Reasoning:**
Sheldon has offered truth. But Yosho's secrets are not his alone — they involve Jurai, Tenchi's heritage, Ryoko's imprisonment, the safety of Earth. He cannot reciprocate fully.

But he can offer training. Guidance. Partnership.

# PART 4: THE AFTERMATH

## 4.1 — The New Dynamic

**What Changes Immediately:**

1. **No More Hiding (Between Them)**
   - Sheldon can navigate in darkness without pretending
   - He can acknowledge when he hears something he shouldn't
   - Training sessions can include supernatural elements

2. **Yosho Becomes Teacher**
   - Offers to help Sheldon understand his abilities
   - Begins structured training (meditation, control, awareness)
   - Watches more carefully, with purpose now

3. **Equals With Secrets**
   - Sheldon knows Yosho is hiding something ("I have some experience")
   - Yosho knows Sheldon is telling partial truth (omissions, not lies)
   - Both accept this. Trust doesn't require total disclosure.

**What Stays The Same:**

1. **Daily Routine**
   - Still cooking, cleaning, caring for Tenchi
   - Still maintaining the shrine
   - Life continues as before

2. **Boundaries With Others**
   - Sheldon still suppresses abilities around Tenchi, Nobuyuki, villagers
   - The secret is between Sheldon and Yosho only

3. **The Fundamental Mystery**
   - Sheldon still doesn't know what he is
   - Yosho still doesn't reveal his own nature
   - Questions remain unanswered

## 4.2 — The Training Begins

**What Yosho Teaches (Years 4-12):**

| Area | Content | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Meditation** | Breathing, stillness, centering | Control over ambient energy |
| **Awareness** | Directed sensing, filtering input | Use enhanced senses without overload |
| **Physical Control** | Kendo forms, body awareness | Channel physical enhancement safely |
| **Suppression** | Damping abilities intentionally | Function normally around others |
| **Philosophy** | Patience, acceptance, long view | Prepare for immortal lifespan |

**Training Schedule:**
- Early morning, before Tenchi wakes
- Late evening, after Tenchi sleeps
- Occasional full days when Tenchi visits Nobuyuki

**Yosho's Observation:**
The training reveals more about Sheldon's nature. His energy signature. His recovery rate. The way his body responds to instruction. Yosho is learning as much as teaching.

## 4.3 — Relationship Evolution

**Years 4-12: Deep Friendship**

The revelation creates space for genuine connection:

- **Intellectual Partnership:** They can discuss things neither can discuss with others
- **Shared Responsibility:** Co-parenting Tenchi, co-maintaining shrine
- **Mutual Respect:** Each knows the other is more than appearances suggest
- **Comfortable Silence:** Two people who don't need to fill space with words

**Not Yet Romantic:**

Sheldon still sees Yosho as an elderly mentor figure. The romantic potential is blocked by:
- Yosho's apparent age (elderly appearance)
- The mentor-student dynamic
- Sheldon's focus on Tenchi and domestic duties
- Yosho's own restraint (he won't pursue while hiding his true form)

*The soil is being prepared. But the seed hasn't been planted yet.*
