# DAY 13 - APRIL 15, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 2: Scenes 051-100 (08:45-12:30)

---

## SCENE 051 | 08:46 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main room, gathering supplies

The drawing supplies lived in a lacquered box in the main room—paper, colored pencils, erasers, the accumulated tools of childhood art. Sheldon gathered them with care, each item placed in a basket for transport.

Tenchi waited in Kiyone's garden. The flowers waited with him.

---

## SCENE 052 | 08:50 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Path to special garden

Walking back to the garden with supplies, Sheldon considered the morning's unexpected turns. The flower project had become something else—a visit to Kiyone's memorial space, a conversation about categories of beauty, a child's education in perception.

Teaching happened in unplanned moments.

---

## SCENE 053 | 08:54 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Special garden, returning

Tenchi sat exactly where Sheldon had left him, eyes still fixed on the mountain violet. The boy's concentration was absolute—the focused attention of childhood, undivided by competing concerns.

"Did you look?"

"It changed color while I watched. Just a little."

---

## SCENE 054 | 08:57 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden

Light shifting on petals could produce that effect—Sheldon knew the physics. But Tenchi's observation was accurate regardless of mechanism. The flower's appearance had changed. The child had watched closely enough to notice.

"Flowers are alive," Sheldon said. "Living things change."

---

## SCENE 055 | 09:01 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden, setting up

They arranged themselves near the violet—paper positioned, pencils selected, the process of rendering beginning. Tenchi chose purple first, studying the flower's exact shade before touching pencil to paper.

"It's not just purple," the boy said. "It has blue parts and dark parts."

---

## SCENE 056 | 09:05 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden, drawing

Sheldon watched Tenchi draw without intervening. The child's approach was intuitive—color blocked first, details added, the flower emerging through accumulated marks rather than careful outline.

A physicist would draw differently. This approach might be better.

---

## SCENE 057 | 09:10 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Special garden

"Grandma drew like this," Tenchi said, not looking up. "She showed me. She said to look at the whole flower, not just the parts."

Kiyone's teaching, transmitted through practice. The garden held more than plants.

---

## SCENE 058 | 09:14 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden

The morning light shifted as they worked, the garden's shadows repositioning, the colors adjusting. Sheldon noticed the changes now because Tenchi had taught him to notice—the child's observation sharpening his own.

Perception was contagious. Attention bred attention.

---

## SCENE 059 | 09:19 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden, first flower complete

The mountain violet took shape on Tenchi's paper—recognizable, expressive, capturing something of the flower's shy quality despite the limitations of a four-year-old's technique.

"That's very good," Sheldon said.

"The leaves are wrong. But the flower is right."

---

## SCENE 060 | 09:23 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden

The child's self-assessment was accurate. The flower portion captured something essential; the leaves were approximate. Tenchi knew the difference without being taught.

Children possessed critical faculties adults sometimes lost. The boy saw clearly.

---

## SCENE 061 | 09:27 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Special garden, moving to narcissus

They relocated to the yellow flowers—the narcissus corner, where sunlight concentrated and the "trumpet flowers" stood at attention.

"These are easier," Tenchi predicted. "They're simpler."

"Simpler?"

"Their shape is... one shape. Not complicated."

---

## SCENE 062 | 09:31 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden, narcissus patch

The narcissus were indeed simpler in form—central trumpet, surrounding petals, the architecture clear and repeatable. Tenchi's observation about complexity was geometrically accurate.

"Good observation. Simple things are often harder to draw, though."

"Why?"

"Because there's nowhere to hide mistakes."

---

## SCENE 063 | 09:35 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden, drawing narcissus

Tenchi drew the narcissus with more confidence than the violet—yellow applied boldly, the shape emerging quickly. The simplicity allowed faster work; the result was different but equally expressive.

"The loud one is done," Tenchi announced.

---

## SCENE 064 | 09:39 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Special garden

Two flowers drawn. One remaining—the surprised camellia. Sheldon looked toward the garden's edge, where the pink-white blooms waited.

"Save the hardest for last?"

"The surprised one isn't hardest. It's just... different."

---

## SCENE 065 | 09:43 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden, camellia area

They settled near the camellia. The flower's expression—if flowers could be said to have expressions—was indeed different from the others. Not shy, not loud, but something between. Surprised, Tenchi had called it.

"How do you draw surprised?" Sheldon asked.

"You draw it how it looks when it's surprised."

---

## SCENE 066 | 09:47 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden

The camellia's petals arranged themselves in overlapping layers—more complex than the narcissus, less hidden than the violet. The pink-white coloring required mixing, the shading subtle.

Tenchi studied the flower for long minutes before beginning.

---

## SCENE 067 | 09:52 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden, drawing camellia

The camellia drawing proceeded slowly—Tenchi working with unusual care, selecting colors, rejecting them, trying combinations. The surprised flower demanded more from its portraitist.

Sheldon waited without rushing. The process was the point.

---

## SCENE 068 | 09:58 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Special garden

"Pink isn't pink," Tenchi said, frustrated. "It has white in it. And a little bit of something else."

"What else?"

"I don't know. The something else is hard to see."

---

## SCENE 069 | 10:02 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden

The something else. Color that couldn't be named, that existed in perception without vocabulary. Tenchi was encountering the limits of language—the gap between what eyes saw and what words could capture.

"Sometimes you have to draw what you see, not what you can name."

---

## SCENE 070 | 10:06 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Special garden

Tenchi returned to drawing with renewed focus. The camellia emerged on paper—not accurate in photographic terms, but expressive in emotional ones. The surprised quality translated, somehow.

Art wasn't reproduction. Art was interpretation.

---

## SCENE 071 | 10:11 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Special garden, completing drawings

"Done!" Tenchi held up the three drawings—violet, narcissus, camellia. Shy, loud, surprised. A child's taxonomy rendered in colored pencil on paper.

"These are wonderful."

"They're for school. But also for me."

---

## SCENE 072 | 10:15 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Special garden, surveying

They sat together in Kiyone's garden, the completed drawings between them. Morning had passed in observation and creation. The shrine's duties waited, but this moment held its own importance.

"Thank you for showing me the special garden," Sheldon said.

"Grandma would like that you came here."

---

## SCENE 073 | 10:19 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Special garden

Grandma would like that. The boy spoke of his mother's preferences in present tense—not grammatical error but continued connection. Kiyone remained a presence whose approval mattered.

"Why would she like it?"

"Because you helped me see the flowers. She wanted people to see them."

---

## SCENE 074 | 10:23 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Special garden

Sheldon felt the weight of the statement. Kiyone had created this garden for others to experience. By bringing Tenchi here, by helping with the flower project, he was fulfilling a purpose she had established.

He was serving the dead woman's intention without having known her.

---

## SCENE 075 | 10:27 | Special Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Special garden, departing

They gathered the drawings and supplies, preparing to leave. The garden would wait—it always waited, patient as any garden, containing Kiyone's plans through seasons she wouldn't see.

"We can come back," Tenchi said.

"We will."

---

## SCENE 076 | 10:31 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main path

The shrine's larger duties reasserted themselves as they walked back—the gravel work waiting, the southern path incomplete, the visitors who might come this weekend.

"I need to carry more gravel," Sheldon said.

"Can I help?"

---

## SCENE 077 | 10:35 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main path

The offer was genuine—a four-year-old wanting to participate in adult work. Sheldon considered how to respond. The wheelbarrow was too heavy; the stairs were too demanding.

"You can help by keeping the gravel pile organized. Making sure it stays neat."

---

## SCENE 078 | 10:39 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Southern path

They reached the gravel pile together—the substantial mound that had grown over days of carrying. Tenchi examined it with serious attention.

"It's bigger than yesterday."

"Two loads this morning, before you woke up."

"You work a lot."

---

## SCENE 079 | 10:43 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Southern path

"The shrine needs work," Sheldon said. "And work feels good when it helps something."

"Like the flowers?"

"Yes. The flowers help the garden. The gravel helps the path. Different kinds of helping."

---

## SCENE 080 | 10:47 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Southern path

Katsuhito appeared as they discussed helping—the old man's timing uncanny, as always. He assessed the scene: child, adult, flower drawings, gravel pile.

"The project is complete?"

"Three flowers," Tenchi reported. "Shy, loud, and surprised."

---

## SCENE 081 | 10:51 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Southern path

Katsuhito examined the drawings with the attention they deserved. His expression shifted as he recognized the flowers—the garden's flowers, Kiyone's flowers.

"You went to the special garden."

"Tenchi showed me."

A pause. "Good."

---

## SCENE 082 | 10:55 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Southern path

The single word—good—carried weight. Katsuhito approved of the visit, of the drawings, of the way morning had unfolded. The old man's approval was spare but significant.

"The gravel can wait until afternoon," Katsuhito said. "Lunch first."

---

## SCENE 083 | 10:59 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Kitchen approach

They walked back toward the house together—grandfather, child, and the person becoming part of this family. The flower drawings rustled slightly in the breeze.

Saturday's morning had been full. Afternoon would bring its own fullness.

---

## SCENE 084 | 11:03 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

Lunch preparation began—Katsuhito directing, Sheldon assisting, Tenchi arranging chopsticks on the table. The domestic choreography had become familiar over thirteen days.

"Rice will take time," Katsuhito said. "The pot needs washing."

---

## SCENE 085 | 11:07 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

The rice pot required specific attention—remnants of yesterday's cooking needed scraping, the surface needed polishing, the metal needed to be ready to receive today's grain. Sheldon performed the task with the care it demanded.

Everything in the shrine required care. The shrine reciprocated.

---

## SCENE 086 | 11:12 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

The repetition of kitchen tasks had become its own meditation. His hands knew the motions; his mind could wander while his body worked. The rhythm created space for processing the morning's experiences.

Kiyone's garden. Tenchi's categories. The surprised flower.

---

## SCENE 087 | 11:17 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

"The special garden needs tending," Katsuhito said, not looking up from his vegetable cutting. "I've managed alone, but..."

The sentence trailed off. An invitation, perhaps. Or an observation about limitations.

"I could help. When there's time."

---

## SCENE 088 | 11:21 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Kiyone knew plants. I know prayers." The old man's voice was quiet. "The garden has suffered from my attention being divided."

"I don't know much about gardens."

"You didn't know much about floors. Or fences. Or gravel."

---

## SCENE 089 | 11:25 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The point was clear—competence was developed, not given. If Sheldon could learn flooring and fencing and gravel carrying, he could learn gardening. The shrine required it. He would acquire the skill.

"Show me what the garden needs. I'll learn."

---

## SCENE 090 | 11:29 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Another commitment. Another expansion of his role. The shrine absorbed effort and returned purpose; every task completed revealed three more waiting.

He didn't mind. The expansion felt like growth.

---

## SCENE 091 | 11:33 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

Lunch assembled itself through their combined effort—soup reheated, rice steaming, pickles retrieved from the crock. Saturday lunch was more leisurely than weekday lunches, the pace adjusted for rest.

"Tenchi, wash your hands," Katsuhito called.

The boy appeared from wherever he'd been, hands extended for inspection.

---

## SCENE 092 | 11:38 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen, beginning lunch

They ate together, the three of them, the flower drawings displayed against the wall where all could see. The shy violet, the loud narcissus, the surprised camellia—witnesses to the meal.

"The teacher will like them," Sheldon said.

"I know." Tenchi's confidence was uncomplicated. He had done good work.

---

## SCENE 093 | 11:43 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

"Grandpa, can Sheldon-san take care of Grandma's garden?"

The question, direct as children's questions always were, created a moment of stillness. Katsuhito set down his chopsticks.

"If he wishes. If he will learn what the garden needs."

---

## SCENE 094 | 11:47 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

The transfer of responsibility—from daughter to father, now potentially to a stranger who had arrived thirteen days ago. The garden's continuation mattered more than its caretaker's history.

"I'll learn," Sheldon said.

"The garden will teach you."

---

## SCENE 095 | 11:51 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Another commitment made in Katsuhito's presence, witnessed by Tenchi's hopeful eyes. The web of obligation grew denser, each thread connecting Sheldon more firmly to this place.

He was being woven into the shrine's fabric. The process was willing.

---

## SCENE 096 | 11:55 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen, finishing lunch

The meal concluded with green tea—a different variety than morning, lighter, meant to accompany food rather than wake the body. Sheldon drank and tasted Saturday's particular flavor.

"Afternoon," Katsuhito said. "The gravel."

---

## SCENE 097 | 12:00 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen, cleaning

Dishes washed in familiar sequence. The hot water, the soap, the systematic attention to each surface. Sheldon performed these tasks with the same care he'd given the rice pot—everything deserved attention.

"I can help," Tenchi offered, though his help consisted mainly of rearranging already-clean chopsticks.

---

## SCENE 098 | 12:05 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Kitchen, completing cleanup

The kitchen returned to order. Dishes dried and stored; surfaces wiped; the fire banked for afternoon's eventual dinner preparation. The cycles of the day proceeded through familiar stations.

"Gravel," Sheldon said. "Four loads this afternoon?"

"If the body permits," Katsuhito replied.

---

## SCENE 099 | 12:10 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tool shed

The wheelbarrow waited. Sheldon gripped its handles with the familiarity of thirteen days, the wood warm from morning sun. Four loads. Perhaps possible; the adaptation continued.

Tenchi followed, determined to participate somehow.

---

## SCENE 100 | 12:15 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Shrine steps, beginning descent

The descent began. Saturday afternoon stretched ahead—gravel to carry, a path to complete, a garden newly promised. The shrine's demands multiplied as his capabilities expanded.

The equation balanced. It always balanced here.
