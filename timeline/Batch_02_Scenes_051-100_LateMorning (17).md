# DAY 17 - APRIL 19, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 2: Scenes 051-100 (08:18-12:15)
## **Solo Work at Tsukino House - Continued**

---

## SCENE 051 | 08:18 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Main Plot

The cleaning revealed a floor problem he hadn't noticed during initial assessment. One section of flooring had subsided—not dramatically, but enough to create an uneven surface.

Foundation issue or joist failure. He'd need to investigate from below.

---

## SCENE 052 | 08:22 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Traditional houses often had raised floors, creating crawl space beneath for ventilation and pest prevention. If this house followed that pattern, access might exist.

He searched the room's perimeter for access panels.

---

## SCENE 053 | 08:26 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Character Development

The search methodology emerged from somewhere—systematic examination of likely locations, elimination of impossible positions, focus on construction logic.

He found the access point in the corner: a removable section disguised as fixed flooring.

---

## SCENE 054 | 08:30 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Transition

The panel lifted with effort, revealing darkness beneath. The smell that emerged was earthy, cool, the particular character of enclosed ground.

He'd need the lantern from his supplies.

---

## SCENE 055 | 08:34 | Tsukino House - Under-Floor Space
**Type:** Main Plot

Lantern retrieved and lit, he lowered himself into the crawl space. Head clearance was minimal—perhaps half a meter—requiring prone movement.

The space had its own geography, its own archaeology of accumulated debris.

---

## SCENE 056 | 08:38 | Tsukino House - Under-Floor Space
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The floor's underside revealed the construction method: joists spanning between foundation stones, flooring boards nailed perpendicular to the joists.

Simple, effective, repairable. The damage was localized rather than systemic.

---

## SCENE 057 | 08:42 | Tsukino House - Under-Floor Space
**Type:** Character Development

He found the problem: one joist had partially rotted, probably from water infiltration during the roof's failure. The affected section had lost structural integrity.

Repair would require sistering a new timber alongside the damaged original.

---

## SCENE 058 | 08:46 | Tsukino House - Under-Floor Space
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Sistering. The term surfaced from wherever his carpentry knowledge lived. Attaching a new structural member beside an existing one, allowing the new to carry loads the old couldn't support.

The metaphor was too obvious to ignore.

---

## SCENE 059 | 08:50 | Tsukino House - Under-Floor Space
**Type:** Subplot

He measured the damaged joist, noting dimensions for material sourcing. The repair wasn't urgent—the subsidence had stabilized—but leaving it unaddressed would allow progressive failure.

Maintenance deferred became maintenance compounded.

---

## SCENE 060 | 08:54 | Tsukino House - Second Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Emerging from the crawl space, he added the joist repair to his growing list. The scope expanded with each examination—more problems, more work, more time required.

But also: more understanding, more capability, more ownership.

---

## SCENE 061 | 08:58 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Water break. The physical work of crawling, examining, climbing had raised his temperature despite the cool morning.

The pump provided fresh water, the well's supply seemingly inexhaustible.

---

## SCENE 062 | 09:02 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

He checked the cabinet repair: adhesive firm, dowels secure. The hinge could be reattached.

Small satisfaction. One item off the list, dozens remaining.

---

## SCENE 063 | 09:06 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Screws positioned, screwdriver applied with controlled pressure. The hinge seated into its new foundation, the door aligning properly for the first time since his arrival.

Functional repair. The cabinet could close completely now.

---

## SCENE 064 | 09:10 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The cabinet's contents—sparse currently, just basic supplies—would expand as the house became more lived-in. Storage requirements scaled with occupancy.

He was planning for a future here. The planning felt appropriate.

---

## SCENE 065 | 09:14 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Subplot

He moved outside, assessing the engawa boards he'd noted earlier. The rot was surface-level in two sections, deeper in the third.

Surface rot could be scraped and treated. Deep rot required replacement.

---

## SCENE 066 | 09:18 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Character Development

The distinction between repairable and replaceable required judgment—how much degradation was acceptable, what safety margin was appropriate, when effort outweighed benefit.

His judgment seemed reliable. He trusted it without fully understanding its source.

---

## SCENE 067 | 09:22 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Main Plot

The third board—the one requiring replacement—had load-bearing function. Walking on it produced concerning flex.

He marked it with charcoal, a warning until proper repair could occur. Safety before aesthetics.

---

## SCENE 068 | 09:26 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Transition

The garden demanded attention his schedule couldn't provide today. But a preliminary survey would inform future planning.

He walked the perimeter, cataloguing what grew and what had died.

---

## SCENE 069 | 09:30 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Ornamental plantings had survived neglect through resilience—camellias, azaleas, the particular Japanese maples that tolerated shade. Vegetables and herbs had long since vanished, their beds colonized by weeds.

Restoration would require clearing before planting.

---

## SCENE 070 | 09:34 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Character Development

The garden's design logic became visible once he looked for it: borrowed scenery from the mountain, interior space creating intimacy, the controlled wildness that Japanese aesthetics valued.

Someone had thought carefully about this space. The thinking deserved revival.

---

## SCENE 071 | 09:38 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Subplot

The small structure he'd noticed—shrine or spirit house—stood in the garden's corner, nearly invisible beneath accumulated growth.

He cleared enough vegetation to assess its condition.

---

## SCENE 072 | 09:42 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

A spirit house: miniature shrine structure, home for protective kami of the property. The condition was poor but not destroyed—weathered wood, faded offerings, years of neglect.

This would require Katsuhito's guidance. Spiritual matters exceeded his understanding.

---

## SCENE 073 | 09:46 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The presence of a spirit house suggested the previous occupants had observed traditional practices. The house had been cared for in ways beyond physical maintenance.

He'd been neglecting obligations he didn't know existed.

---

## SCENE 074 | 09:50 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

He noted the spirit house's position: northeast corner, protective against kimon—the demon gate through which malevolent forces supposedly entered.

Superstition or tradition or both. The placement was intentional regardless of efficacy.

---

## SCENE 075 | 09:54 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Transition

Back to the tool shed for another survey. The morning's work had revealed needs; the shed might contain solutions.

He examined the accumulated equipment more carefully.

---

## SCENE 076 | 09:58 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

Garden tools emerged from the collection: hand cultivators, pruning shears, a small hand saw for branch removal. All requiring cleaning but fundamentally sound.

The previous occupant had been prepared for garden maintenance.

---

## SCENE 077 | 10:02 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

He began sorting: woodworking tools in one area, garden tools in another, general purpose items in a third.

Organization as first step toward utility. The principle applied across domains.

---

## SCENE 078 | 10:06 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

Among the tools, a discovery: a wooden box containing metal files, whetstones, and sharpening equipment.

The tools could be restored. The resources existed for their maintenance.

---

## SCENE 079 | 10:10 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Sharpening equipment suggested a craftsman's mindset—tools were investments requiring maintenance, not disposable items replaced when dull.

The philosophy aligned with his emerging values. Care over convenience.

---

## SCENE 080 | 10:14 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

He selected several tools for immediate restoration: a hand plane, a chisel, a small saw. These would serve the day's remaining work and establish sharpening methodology.

First tool: the hand plane, its blade visibly dulled.

---

## SCENE 081 | 10:18 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

The sharpening process engaged muscles and concentration simultaneously. Blade angle against stone, pressure constant, strokes uniform.

His hands knew the motion. The knowledge expressed itself through movement.

---

## SCENE 082 | 10:22 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Sharpening was meditation in a way cooking wasn't—the repetitive motion allowing thought to wander while body continued its task.

He thought about the house, the garden, the spirit house he'd discovered.

---

## SCENE 083 | 10:26 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Transition

The plane blade achieved acceptable sharpness—not master quality, but functional. He tested it on scrap wood, watching curls emerge thin and consistent.

Adequate for current needs. Improvement would come with practice.

---

## SCENE 084 | 10:30 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

Chisel next. The blade had been good quality originally—the steel held its edge well, requiring less aggressive restoration.

Ten minutes of careful work produced acceptable results.

---

## SCENE 085 | 10:34 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Japanese chisels differed from Western—harder steel, steeper bevel angles, designed for precise work rather than heavy removal.

The technique for sharpening adjusted accordingly.

---

## SCENE 086 | 10:38 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

He'd never formally learned these distinctions. The knowledge existed without source, without memory of acquisition.

He'd stopped questioning this pattern. Utility outweighed curiosity about origin.

---

## SCENE 087 | 10:42 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

The small saw presented different challenges—many teeth, each requiring individual attention. He examined the technique, then began the patient work.

Tooth by tooth. No shortcuts existed.

---

## SCENE 088 | 10:46 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The saw sharpening consumed twenty minutes—tedious but necessary. Each tooth received attention, the cutting edge restored incrementally.

The finished tool cut cleanly through test wood. Success.

---

## SCENE 089 | 10:50 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Transition

Armed with restored tools, he returned to the wall panel project. The damaged frame member awaited his attention.

The chisel work would be delicate—removing compromised wood while preserving sound material.

---

## SCENE 090 | 10:54 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

He began the careful extraction, chisel finding the boundary between rot and integrity. The distinction was visible once looked for—color difference, texture change, resistance variation.

Reading wood. Another skill that had arrived without instruction.

---

## SCENE 091 | 10:58 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The rot had advanced further than surface examination suggested—a common problem with water damage. Surface drying masked interior degradation.

He expanded his work area, revealing the true extent of the problem.

---

## SCENE 092 | 11:02 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

The damaged section was larger than hoped—not catastrophic, but requiring more material than he had available.

He'd need to source timber. Another item for Yamada or the village lumber supplier.

---

## SCENE 093 | 11:06 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Every repair revealed hidden problems. The pattern was consistent—investigation expanding scope, solutions requiring resources not immediately available.

Patience was mandatory. Impatience would produce incomplete work.

---

## SCENE 094 | 11:10 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot

He cleaned the prepared area, applying preservative compound he'd found in the shed—some kind of traditional wood treatment, the smell sharp and unfamiliar.

Protection for the exposed surfaces while he sourced repair materials.

---

## SCENE 095 | 11:14 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Hunger announced itself through the particular distraction of an empty stomach. He'd been working for hours without eating since morning's cold rice.

Lunch would require preparation.

---

## SCENE 096 | 11:18 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The supplies were limited—this house lacked the shrine's provisions. He assembled what existed: rice (always rice), pickled vegetables, a small portion of dried fish.

Simple sustenance. Adequate for work continuation.

---

## SCENE 097 | 11:22 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

Cooking for one felt different than cooking for the household. Less ceremony, less creativity, more pure function.

He didn't mind the reduction. Some meals were fuel; others were art.

---

## SCENE 098 | 11:26 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The kitchen's limitations became apparent through use—insufficient storage, inadequate counter space, the particular inconveniences of an unmaintained cooking area.

These were problems he could solve. Kitchen renovation moved up the priority list.

---

## SCENE 099 | 11:30 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot

He ate at the low table in the main room, the space now cleaner than it had been since his arrival. The improvement was visible—light seemed brighter, air seemed cleaner.

Progress made manifest through reduced entropy.

---

## SCENE 100 | 11:34 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Solitary lunch in a house he was slowly claiming. The situation would have seemed impossible a month ago—a different life, a different country, a different existence entirely.

Now it felt like the most natural thing in the world.

---
