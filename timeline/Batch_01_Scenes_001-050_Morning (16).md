# DAY 22 - APRIL 24, 1989 (MONDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (04:30-08:00)
## **TENCHI'S 5TH BIRTHDAY**

---

## SCENE 001 | 04:32 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Main Plot

Consciousness arrived before dawn, pulled upward by purpose rather than alarm. Today was different. Today mattered in ways that required preparation.

He lay still for three breaths, cataloguing the darkness, letting his mind organize the day ahead.

---

## SCENE 002 | 04:35 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development

Twenty-two days. Three weeks and one day since arriving on this mountain, in this life, in this borrowed identity.

Today, a child who'd accepted him without reservation would turn five years old. The occasion demanded acknowledgment beyond words.

---

## SCENE 003 | 04:38 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

His grandmother had believed birthdays were sacred. Not religious sacred—something deeper. The day someone arrived in the world deserved recognition.

Tenchi had arrived five years ago. Sheldon would recognize that arrival properly.

---

## SCENE 004 | 04:41 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Transition

Futon folded in darkness, movements practiced enough to require no light. His body knew the sequence: lift, fold, store. The room returned to its neutral state.

Outside, the mountain held its pre-dawn silence.

---

## SCENE 005 | 04:45 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Water splashed cold against his face. The shock completed what consciousness had begun—full alertness, focused attention, the particular readiness that complicated tasks required.

He dried his face and began dressing.

---

## SCENE 006 | 04:49 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The clothes he'd chosen the night before waited in their designated spot. Clean trousers, a shirt without stains or patches. Not formal wear—nothing he owned qualified as formal—but respectable.

Today he'd meet Nobuyuki Masaki. First impressions mattered.

---

## SCENE 007 | 04:53 | Tsukino House - Entrance
**Type:** Subplot

The lantern's wick caught on the second attempt. Its light pushed back the darkness incrementally, creating a sphere of visibility around his feet.

Outside, the sky showed the first hints of gray at the eastern horizon.

---

## SCENE 008 | 04:57 | Path to Shrine - Start
**Type:** Main Plot

The door closed behind him with its familiar protest. Three weeks had taught him every sound this house made—the specific creak of this hinge, the particular resistance of this lock.

He stepped onto the path, lantern held low.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:01 | Path to Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Dawn came differently in late April than it had in early April. The quality of light changed—warmer, richer, arriving from a different angle as the sun's track shifted northward.

Spring progressed. The mountain noticed.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:05 | Path to Shrine
**Type:** Character Development

His stride had lengthened since arrival. The path that once required careful attention now accepted his feet like familiar territory.

Adaptation. The body learned what the mind couldn't teach directly.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:09 | Path to Shrine - Stream Crossing
**Type:** Transition

The stream ran lower than it had three weeks ago. Snowmelt from higher elevations had diminished; the water now came from springs rather than seasonal thaw.

He crossed the stones without hesitation, balance automatic.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:13 | Path to Shrine - Midpoint
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Three weeks. Enough time to establish patterns, not enough to consider them permanent.

But today felt like a threshold. Today, with the birthday and Nobuyuki's arrival, something would solidify. He felt its approach without being able to name it.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:17 | Path to Shrine - Upper Section
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Birds had begun their morning announcements. The uguisu's call—that distinctive two-note phrase—echoed from somewhere in the cedars. Other voices joined, creating a layered symphony of territory claims.

The mountain woke in stages.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:21 | Shrine Steps - Lower
**Type:** Main Plot

The 320 steps rose ahead, their stone surfaces catching the earliest light. He began the ascent at his now-standard pace—not rushed, not leisurely.

Arriving early was the goal. Arriving exhausted would defeat the purpose.

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:29 | Shrine Steps - Middle
**Type:** Character Development

His breathing remained steady through the climb. Three weeks ago, this midpoint had required rest. Now his body handled the exertion without distress.

Progress measured in heartbeats per step. The metric satisfied his physicist's mind.

---

## SCENE 016 | 05:37 | Shrine Steps - Upper
**Type:** Transition

The final steps delivered him to the shrine grounds as the sky shifted from gray to gold. The timing pleased him—arriving with the light, ready to begin work before others woke.

The kitchen awaited.

---

## SCENE 017 | 05:40 | Shrine Grounds - Path
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Dew coated everything—grass, stones, the wooden surfaces of the walkway he'd helped repair six days ago. The moisture would evaporate as the sun rose, but now it created a world of reflected light.

Birthday weather. Tenchi would appreciate the sparkle.

---

## SCENE 018 | 05:43 | Main House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

No light showed in the windows. Katsuhito was either still sleeping or meditating somewhere private. Tenchi would sleep until someone woke him.

He had the kitchen to himself. The conditions were optimal.

---

## SCENE 019 | 05:46 | Main House - Genkan
**Type:** Transition

Shoes exchanged for indoor slippers, the motion automatic now. The house accepted his entry without comment—no creaking floorboards to announce his presence, no obstacles in the dark hallway.

He knew this space. It was beginning to know him.

---

## SCENE 020 | 05:49 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen waited in pre-dawn dimness. He didn't light the lamp immediately—his eyes had adjusted to low light during the walk, and he wanted to preserve that adaptation while he organized.

Counter. Stove. Rice cooker. Refrigerator. Each in its place.

---

## SCENE 021 | 05:52 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The ingredients he'd requested were waiting: eggs from the village, the particular vegetables Tenchi favored, fish for the formal breakfast Katsuhito had suggested.

Birthday breakfast required more than ordinary effort.

---

## SCENE 022 | 05:55 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

He lit the lamp, flooding the space with warm light. His hands moved to familiar positions—knife here, cutting board there, bowls arranged by size and purpose.

The kitchen organized itself around his intentions.

---

## SCENE 023 | 05:58 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Rice first. The foundation of every Japanese meal, requiring the longest preparation time.

He measured with the precision his skills demanded—not approximate, not eyeballed, but exact. The ratio mattered. The washing mattered. The soaking time mattered.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:02 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Three weeks of cooking for this household had refined his technique. Not improved—the skills had arrived nearly complete—but adapted. Calibrated to this stove, these pots, the particular preferences of these people.

Tenchi liked his rice slightly softer. Katsuhito preferred it firmer. He'd learned to split the difference.

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:06 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Rice set to soak. The clock in his mind began counting—twenty minutes minimum, thirty optimal for the texture he wanted.

Dashi next. The foundation beneath the foundation.

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:10 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Kombu went into cold water, beginning its slow release of glutamate and mineral complexity. This broth would become miso soup, would flavor the fish, would tie the entire meal together through shared underlying character.

Japanese cooking built upward from shared foundations.

---

## SCENE 027 | 06:14 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

He heard movement elsewhere in the house—Katsuhito rising, probably. The priest's morning routine began earlier than most.

No footsteps approached the kitchen. Space being given. Trust being demonstrated.

---

## SCENE 028 | 06:18 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Vegetables washed and set to drain. The selection had been careful: the particular green onions Tenchi called "tasty," the daikon that added substance to soup, the cucumber that would become decorative garnish.

Children noticed colors. The plate would be beautiful.

---

## SCENE 029 | 06:22 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

His hands moved without conscious direction, executing tasks in the proper sequence without requiring deliberate thought. The efficiency pleased him—not because speed mattered, but because it indicated integration.

He was becoming competent. Not just capable—competent. The distinction mattered.

---

## SCENE 030 | 06:26 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The fish—sea bream, a luxury item that Katsuhito had somehow acquired for the occasion—waited in the refrigerator's cold section. He'd prepare it last, when timing became critical.

Fish this good deserved respect in the cooking.

---

## SCENE 031 | 06:30 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Tamagoyaki preparation began. The eggs cracked cleanly—his technique had improved from acceptable to refined over three weeks. The mixture received dashi, a touch of sugar, the particular seasoning balance Tenchi preferred.

Birthday eggs for a birthday boy.

---

## SCENE 032 | 06:34 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The rectangular pan heated while he whisked. Tamagoyaki was a test of control—temperature management, timing, the physical coordination required to roll thin layers into substantial form.

He'd failed this test his first attempt. Now his success rate approached complete.

---

## SCENE 033 | 06:38 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

First layer poured, spread, beginning to set at the edges. The spatula found its angle. The roll began—not rushed, not hesitant, but with the particular confidence that came from repeated success.

Perfect edge. Clean fold. Layer one complete.

---

## SCENE 034 | 06:42 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Footsteps in the hallway. Light, controlled, the particular rhythm he recognized as Katsuhito's morning pace.

The priest appeared in the kitchen doorway, assessed the situation with a glance, nodded once, and continued toward wherever his morning meditation occurred.

No words necessary. The acknowledgment was sufficient.

---

## SCENE 035 | 06:46 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Second layer poured against the first roll. The technique required precise temperature—too hot and the egg cooked before spreading, too cool and it didn't set properly.

His hands knew the correct moment. He trusted them.

---

## SCENE 036 | 06:50 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Birthday cooking felt different than daily cooking. The same actions carried additional weight, additional meaning. Each choice became deliberate rather than routine.

This meal would exist in Tenchi's memory. The thought demanded excellence.

---

## SCENE 037 | 06:54 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The tamagoyaki completed—six layers, golden exterior, the interior maintaining the moisture that distinguished good technique from adequate technique.

He set it aside to rest. The eggs would continue cooking from residual heat, reaching optimal texture in ten minutes.

---

## SCENE 038 | 06:58 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Morning light had strengthened through the window. The kitchen's eastern exposure meant early illumination—practical for cooking, beautiful as bonus.

He worked in sunlight now, the lamp unnecessary.

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:02 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Dashi ready. The kombu removed before boiling point, the katsuobushi added and strained, the liquid now carrying depth it hadn't possessed as plain water.

Transformation through technique. The universal pattern.

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:06 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Subplot

Rice timer approaching completion. He checked the cooker—the particular sound it made indicating proper progress. The steam vents released their controlled exhale.

Everything proceeding on schedule.

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:10 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Character Development

The sea bream required his full attention. Scaling, gutting, the particular cuts that would allow even cooking and attractive presentation.

His knife found the angles. The fish yielded to proper technique.

---

## SCENE 042 | 07:14 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Salt applied to the fish skin—enough to enhance flavor and encourage crisping, not so much as to overpower. The balance required judgment rather than measurement.

His hands knew the correct amount. He scattered it with confidence.

---

## SCENE 043 | 07:18 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Nobuyuki would arrive sometime this morning. Tenchi's father, whom he'd heard about but never met. The man who'd lost his wife two years ago. The architect who lived in the city.

First impressions worked both directions. This meal would speak for him.

---

## SCENE 044 | 07:22 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

The grill heated while he prepared miso paste—white miso for this meal, appropriate for spring, its mild sweetness matching the occasion's celebratory tone.

Seasonality mattered. Birthdays in spring deserved spring flavors.

---

## SCENE 045 | 07:26 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Pickles selected from the crock: cucumber, daikon, a small portion of the red shiso he'd noticed Tenchi eating with particular enthusiasm.

Color variety on the plate. Visual appeal as important as flavor.

---

## SCENE 046 | 07:30 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Fish to grill. The skin side faced the heat first, beginning its transformation from raw to bronzed. Fat rendered. Proteins set. The particular smell of cooking fish filled the kitchen.

Seven minutes each side. He watched without touching.

---

## SCENE 047 | 07:34 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

Movement from upstairs. Small feet on wooden floor—Tenchi waking, drawn perhaps by smells or by the internal calendar that told children when their birthday had arrived.

The meal wasn't quite ready. He accelerated slightly.

---

## SCENE 048 | 07:38 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Miso soup assembled: tofu cubed and added, green onions scattered across the surface, the broth heated to just below boiling.

Rice fluffed in its cooker. Tamagoyaki sliced into precise portions. Plates arranged on the counter.

---

## SCENE 049 | 07:42 | Main House - Hallway
**Type:** Main Plot

Tenchi appeared at the kitchen doorway, hair disheveled, pajamas rumpled, eyes still carrying sleep. But behind the drowsiness, excitement was building.

"Sheldon-san?" The voice was tentative, hopeful.

"Happy birthday, Tenchi."

---

## SCENE 050 | 07:45 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

The boy's face transformed. The sleepiness burned away, replaced by pure, uncomplicated joy.

"It's my birthday!"

"It is. And breakfast is almost ready. Special birthday breakfast."

Tenchi's gaze moved to the counter, taking in the elaborate preparation. His eyes widened further.
