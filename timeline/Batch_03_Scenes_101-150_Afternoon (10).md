# DAY 7 - APRIL 9, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 3: Scenes 101-150 (12:30-16:00)

---

## SCENE 101 | 11:53 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

Lunch preparation proceeded with unusual energy. Sheldon moved through the kitchen with the residual momentum of the morning's discoveries, his mind cataloguing tasks while his hands addressed rice and vegetables.

Tenchi watched from the doorway, questions accumulating faster than patience could restrain.

---

## SCENE 102 | 11:57 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

"Tell me about the garden," Tenchi demanded.

Sheldon described it—the pond, the stream, the wild plants obscuring careful beds. The boy listened with the intensity children reserved for stories that mattered.

"Will there be fish?"

"I don't know yet. Maybe."

---

## SCENE 103 | 12:01 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

The possibility of fish had captured Tenchi's imagination. Sheldon filed this interest, recognizing it as potential—a reason for the boy to visit, a connection between the shrine and the village house.

Relationships required tending, like gardens.

---

## SCENE 104 | 12:05 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

Lunch took shape: rice balls, pickled vegetables, miso soup with tofu. The combination was familiar now, comforting in its predictability. Seven days had made this cuisine his baseline.

The house below would require establishing its own kitchen rhythms.

---

## SCENE 105 | 12:10 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen, during meal

Katsuhito ate with unusual silence, his expression contemplative. Sheldon recognized the quality—the old man was processing something, reaching conclusions without the need to verbalize them.

"You're planning," Sheldon observed.

"I am considering what changes."

---

## SCENE 106 | 12:14 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"What changes?"

"The shrine has had one worker for decades. Now it has two. The distribution of tasks will shift." Katsuhito paused. "And you will have your own tasks below. The balance requires thought."

The logistics of divided attention.

---

## SCENE 107 | 12:18 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Two locations, two sets of responsibilities. The shrine required daily attention; the house required establishment work. Sheldon's time would need allocation he hadn't yet calculated.

"I can come early," he offered. "Morning work here. Afternoon at the house."

---

## SCENE 108 | 12:22 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

"That would serve," Katsuhito agreed. "Until Golden Week, at least. After the visitors, we will reassess."

The deadline loomed—three weeks until the shrine needed to be fully prepared. The house work would have to wait until that pressure eased.

---

## SCENE 109 | 12:26 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

"The ceremonial items," Sheldon said, redirecting to immediate concerns. "The remaining bowls."

"Tomorrow. Today is for processing what you've seen." Katsuhito's tone brooked no argument. "Rest does not always mean stillness. Sometimes it means integration."

---

## SCENE 110 | 12:30 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Main room

The afternoon spread before them without specific obligations. Sunday's different tempo, combined with the morning's intensity, created space that felt unfamiliar.

Tenchi had claimed the tatami for drawing. Katsuhito retreated to his room. Sheldon was left to himself.

---

## SCENE 111 | 12:35 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room, engawa

He sat on the engawa and looked out at the shrine grounds. The familiar view held new meaning now—this was one of two places he belonged. The house below was the other.

Split attention would become normal. He needed to accept that.

---

## SCENE 112 | 12:40 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Engawa

The mountain afternoon was mild, spring asserting itself against winter's lingering grasp. New growth was visible everywhere—buds on branches, green shoots emerging from brown beds. The world was waking from dormancy.

His garden below would be waking too. Wildly, uncontrolled, but waking.

---

## SCENE 113 | 12:45 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Engawa

His mind returned to the photograph—Kiyoshi and the woman. The resemblance he couldn't quite identify. If she was his mother's sibling, she would be family in a way that felt more tangible than ancestor tablets.

Could she still be alive? Could she be found?

---

## SCENE 114 | 12:50 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Engawa

The questions multiplied. The letters from Canada. The correspondents across Japan. Kiyoshi's social network, preserved in paper and ink, waiting to be mapped.

Tomorrow he would begin reading. Today was for the questions themselves.

---

## SCENE 115 | 12:55 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room, with Tenchi

Tenchi approached with his latest drawing—the house Sheldon had described, wildly proportioned, the garden a scribble of green surrounding it.

"Is this right?" the boy asked.

"It's perfect," Sheldon said, and meant it.

---

## SCENE 116 | 13:00 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Main room

They sat together, Sheldon adding details to his description while Tenchi annotated the drawing. The pond became a blue circle. The stream became a wavy line. The stepping stones became dots.

Collaborative creation. Another form of connection.

---

## SCENE 117 | 13:05 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main room

"What's this?" Tenchi pointed to a shape Sheldon hadn't described.

"What do you think it is?"

"A fish." The boy's certainty was absolute. "For the pond."

"Then it's a fish."

---

## SCENE 118 | 13:10 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main room

The drawing acquired fish—three of them, orange and gold, swimming in the blue circle. Tenchi had decided the pond's future before Sheldon had assessed its present.

Children's visions sometimes became obligations. This one might be worth accepting.

---

## SCENE 119 | 13:15 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Main path

Restlessness drove Sheldon outside. The afternoon's spaciousness required movement. He walked the shrine grounds with the particular attention of someone seeing with new eyes.

Everything here was one thing. Everything below was another.

---

## SCENE 120 | 13:20 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Eastern path

The eastern path led toward a garden he hadn't fully explored. Sheldon followed it, noting similarities and differences with what he'd seen at the Tsukino house. Different plants. Similar principles.

Gardens spoke a language. He was beginning to learn its grammar.

---

## SCENE 121 | 13:25 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Eastern garden

The shrine's garden was more controlled than Kiyoshi's wild space—regularly maintained, plants kept within bounds. But the underlying aesthetic was related. Japanese garden philosophy, expressed in different contexts.

Kiyoshi had studied this style. Perhaps he'd visited here.

---

## SCENE 122 | 13:30 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Eastern garden

A stone lantern occupied the garden's center, its design simpler than the ornate examples in photographs Sheldon had seen. Functional beauty. Light and structure combined.

The Tsukino garden had no lantern. Adding one might honor Kiyoshi's aesthetic.

---

## SCENE 123 | 13:35 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Eastern garden

He sat on a stone bench—smooth, positioned for contemplation—and let his thoughts organize themselves. The morning's discoveries required processing. The implications required time to settle.

He owned a house. He had ancestors. He had a garden to restore.

---

## SCENE 124 | 13:40 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Eastern garden

The identity question returned with new complexity. Sheldon Tsukino—the name on documents, the nephew recorded in registers, the inheritor of property. Was that identity fabrication or recovery?

The presence had said Kiyoshi was real. Did that make Sheldon's family real too?

---

## SCENE 125 | 13:45 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Eastern garden

The garden's sounds provided backdrop—birds, wind through branches, the distant murmur of the forest. Natural rhythms that predated human concern, that would continue regardless of individual questions.

The questions mattered to him. They didn't matter to the mountain.

---

## SCENE 126 | 13:50 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Eastern garden

Movement at the garden's edge—Katsuhito, approaching with the unhurried pace that characterized his movement. The old man settled onto the bench's far end without comment.

Companionable presence. No conversation required.

---

## SCENE 127 | 13:55 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Eastern garden

They sat together in the spring afternoon, two men of uncertain age sharing silence. Sheldon found himself grateful for the company that demanded nothing, that simply offered presence.

"Thank you," he said eventually.

"For?"

"For letting me process."

---

## SCENE 128 | 14:00 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Eastern garden

"Processing is necessary work," Katsuhito replied. "The mind requires time to integrate what the eyes have seen. Rushing that process produces incomplete understanding."

The teaching embedded in the statement. Another lesson without explicit instruction.

---

## SCENE 129 | 14:05 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Eastern garden

"Did you know Kiyoshi well?" Sheldon asked. The question had been waiting.

"Well enough. He was not a man who revealed himself easily. But over decades, even the private reveal themselves."

"What did he reveal?"

---

## SCENE 130 | 14:10 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Eastern garden

Katsuhito considered. "He revealed patience. He revealed attention. He revealed the capacity to love something—his garden—with complete commitment." A pause. "He revealed loneliness that he had learned to live with."

A portrait in fragments. A man shaped by what he'd given himself to.

---

## SCENE 131 | 14:15 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Eastern garden

"The woman in the photograph," Sheldon ventured. "Who was she?"

"His sister. Your mother's older sibling. Fumiko." Katsuhito's voice was careful. "She married a man from Tokyo. Moved there forty years ago."

---

## SCENE 132 | 14:20 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Eastern garden

Fumiko. An aunt. Living—presumably—in Tokyo. Family that existed beyond tablets and inheritance.

"Is she still alive?"

"I believe so. Kiyoshi corresponded with her until his illness. She was unable to travel for the funeral."

---

## SCENE 133 | 14:25 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Eastern garden

Living family. The possibility expanded outward—if Fumiko was alive, she might have children. Cousins. A network of relations Sheldon hadn't considered.

The fabrication—if it was fabrication—had depth he hadn't anticipated.

---

## SCENE 134 | 14:30 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Eastern garden

"Should I contact her?" Sheldon asked.

Katsuhito weighed the question. "That is for you to decide. She knows of your existence—Kiyoshi wrote to her about his nephew. She chose not to reach out."

The implication was clear. Contact might be unwelcome.

---

## SCENE 135 | 14:35 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Eastern garden

"Why not?"

"Family has its complexities. Fumiko and your mother... there was distance. Not hostility, exactly. But distance that was never bridged."

Another mystery. Another layer of history to unravel.

---

## SCENE 136 | 14:40 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Eastern garden

Sheldon filed the information without pressing further. Fumiko existed. Contact was possible but perhaps not advisable. The letters in Kiyoshi's drawer might reveal more about the relationship.

Information would accumulate. Patience was required.

---

## SCENE 137 | 14:45 | Shrine Garden - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Eastern garden

The afternoon had deepened, shadows lengthening across the garden. Time's passage visible in light's angle, in temperature's gradual drop.

"We should check on Tenchi," Katsuhito said, rising with the smooth motion that belied his apparent age.

---

## SCENE 138 | 14:50 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Main room

Tenchi had fallen asleep among his drawings, the picture of the house clutched to his chest. The fish had multiplied—seven now, a school for the pond he'd decided would exist.

Sheldon covered him with a light blanket and let him sleep.

---

## SCENE 139 | 14:55 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room

Watching a child sleep. Such a simple thing, carrying such weight. The vulnerability of unconsciousness. The trust required to let go of waking.

Tenchi trusted this space. Trusted the adults within it. That trust was gift and obligation.

---

## SCENE 140 | 15:00 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The afternoon required tea. Sheldon prepared it with the automaticity of established habit, his hands knowing the sequence while his mind processed the day's revelations.

An aunt named Fumiko. A sister with distance from his mother. A family more complex than he'd imagined.

---

## SCENE 141 | 15:05 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito accepted the tea with a nod that acknowledged more than the beverage. The old man understood what Sheldon was processing—the layers of identity, the questions of authenticity.

"Does it matter," Katsuhito asked quietly, "whether the history was created or recovered?"

---

## SCENE 142 | 15:09 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

The question cut to the core of Sheldon's uncertainty. Created or recovered. Fabrication or revelation. The difference mattered philosophically—but did it matter practically?

"I don't know," he admitted.

"Perhaps that is the answer."

---

## SCENE 143 | 15:13 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"The tablets are real," Sheldon reasoned aloud. "Haruki and Yuki and Kiyoshi—they lived. They died. Their names are recorded beyond this household."

"Yes."

"So the family is real. My connection to it... that's the uncertain part."

---

## SCENE 144 | 15:17 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Connection can be earned," Katsuhito said. "Blood is one form of connection. Care is another. You intend to care for what Kiyoshi left. That creates connection regardless of blood."

The philosophy offered comfort. Connection through action rather than ancestry.

---

## SCENE 145 | 15:21 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

The tea's warmth spread through him, grounding abstract consideration in physical sensation. He was here. The house was there. The garden waited. The philosophical questions could wait too.

What mattered was what he would do.

---

## SCENE 146 | 15:25 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Main room

Tenchi stirred, the afternoon nap releasing its hold. The boy woke in stages, confusion giving way to recognition, recognition giving way to the immediate concerns of childhood.

"I'm hungry."

"Dinner isn't for a while. Would you like a snack?"

---

## SCENE 147 | 15:30 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

The snack was simple—rice crackers, a few slices of pickled radish. Tenchi ate with the single-minded focus of a child refueling, his drawings temporarily forgotten.

"Can I really visit the house?"

"Really. Soon. When it's ready for visitors."

---

## SCENE 148 | 15:35 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Main room

Ready for visitors meant cleaned, aired, stocked with provisions for hospitality. Another set of tasks to add to the list. The house would need to welcome before it could fully become home.

Hospitality as ownership ritual. The social dimension of claiming space.

---

## SCENE 149 | 15:40 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Main room

The afternoon was fading toward evening, Sunday's different rhythm approaching its close. Tomorrow would bring return to shrine work, to the practical tasks of preparation.

Today had been for discovery. Tomorrow would be for application.

---

## SCENE 150 | 15:45 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Main room, at window

Through the window, the mountain showed its evening face—softer light, longer shadows, the gradual transition toward rest. The shrine would sleep soon, its human occupants following the day's lead.

Tomorrow the work would continue. Tonight was for settling into what had changed.
