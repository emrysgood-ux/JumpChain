# DAY 7 - APRIL 9, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 1: Scenes 001-050 (05:00-10:00)

---

## SCENE 001 | 05:06 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Guest room, waking

The seventh morning arrived with clarity—no rain, no clouds, just the particular stillness of early spring before the day's warmth arrived. Sheldon's eyes opened to familiar shadows, but the familiarity carried different weight today.

Today he would see his house.

---

## SCENE 002 | 05:09 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Guest room

The word claimed ownership it hadn't earned. His house. A structure he'd never seen, inherited from an uncle he'd never met, part of a family history that might or might not be fabrication.

And yet. The presence had said Kiyoshi was real. The house was real. The inheritance was genuine.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:13 | Guest Room - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Guest room

His body moved through the waking routine without hesitation—futon folded, stored, the small room restored to its daytime configuration. Seven days had encoded this sequence. Seven days had made this space temporary home.

Today he would encounter what might become permanent.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:17 | Bathroom - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Bathroom

The cold water on his face carried the mountain's temperature—the well's depth translating to degrees. His skin had stopped protesting the chill; his body accepted it as information rather than insult.

He was adapting to this place. Today he would claim more of it.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:21 | Hallway - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Corridor

The hallway's familiar darkness guided his feet toward the kitchen. Each creak of flooring registered without conscious attention, the house's voice known now, its particular music part of his internal map.

He passed Tenchi's door without pausing. The boy would sleep later on Sundays.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:25 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

Katsuhito was already present, the fire established, tea steeping. The old man looked up as Sheldon entered, and something in his expression suggested this morning was different for him too.

"You slept well?"

"Well enough."

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:28 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

They sat with tea between them, the silence comfortable but charged. The day's purpose waited, unspoken but acknowledged. Sheldon felt his heart rate elevated slightly—anticipation, not fear.

"The keys," Katsuhito said finally. "I'll retrieve them after breakfast."

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:32 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

Keys. Such ordinary objects, yet weighted with significance. Keys meant access, meant ownership, meant the right to enter spaces from which others were excluded.

Keys meant he had a place that was his.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:36 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

Breakfast preparation followed its usual pattern, but Sheldon moved through it with divided attention. Part of his mind catalogued rice, soup, pickles; part wandered to the village below, to a house waiting in morning light.

"You're distracted," Katsuhito observed.

"Anticipation."

"Understandable."

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:41 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

"What should I expect to feel?" Sheldon asked. "When I enter."

Katsuhito considered the question with the care he gave all questions. "You will feel what you feel. The house will tell you what it needs."

Not advice. Acknowledgment that the experience defied prediction.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:45 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

The rice cooker clicked from cooking to warming—a sound that had become signal, marking the meal's readiness. Sheldon rose to serve, his hands performing their task while his thoughts continued their wandering.

The house waited. The house had waited eighteen months. It could wait through breakfast.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:50 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Hallway to Tenchi's room

Light footsteps. Tenchi emerging earlier than expected, drawn perhaps by unusual sounds or unusual silence. The boy appeared in the kitchen doorway, rubbing sleep from his eyes.

"Is today the day?"

"Today is the day."

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:53 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen

Tenchi settled into his place at the table with unusual solemnity. The boy understood that something important was happening, even if the details remained unclear.

"Will you come back?" he asked.

"I'll come back every day. I promised."

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:57 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen, during meal

The promise registered in Tenchi's expression—relief and acceptance in equal measure. The boy had learned to test commitments, to verify that words matched intentions.

Sheldon intended to match his words. The intention felt like vow.

---

## SCENE 015 | 06:02 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Kitchen

The meal proceeded with subdued conversation—Tenchi's questions about the house (how big? what color? does it have a garden?), Katsuhito's partial answers (small, traditional, yes), Sheldon's additions from what little he knew.

A house built from fragments of information.

---

## SCENE 016 | 06:08 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Kitchen

"Kiyoshi-san's garden had many plants," Katsuhito offered. "He knew the names of every one. Some were rare—brought from other regions, cultivated specifically."

"Will they have survived?"

"Some will. Gardens are resilient."

---

## SCENE 017 | 06:13 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Kitchen

The garden occupied increasing space in Sheldon's imagination. Kiyoshi's soul, Katsuhito had called it. A man's essence made physical through years of attention and cultivation.

He would inherit that soul along with the soil that contained it.

---

## SCENE 018 | 06:18 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Kitchen

His own gardening experience was theoretical—he'd read about plants, understood photosynthesis and nutrient cycles, knew the science without knowing the practice.

That would need to change. Kiyoshi's garden would require a gardener.

---

## SCENE 019 | 06:23 | Kitchen - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Kitchen, after meal

The dishes required attention. Sheldon washed them with the care he'd learned, each bowl and plate receiving its due focus. The routine grounded him, pulled his thoughts from anticipation to presence.

"After this," Katsuhito said. "We go."

---

## SCENE 020 | 06:28 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Storage room

The keys lived in a lacquered box on the storage room's highest shelf. Katsuhito retrieved them with the reverence due to significant objects—three keys on a worn iron ring, each shaped differently.

"Front door. Back door. Storage shed."

---

## SCENE 021 | 06:31 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Storage room

The keys felt heavier than their physical weight justified. Sheldon held them in his palm and felt the symbolic transfer—Katsuhito passing stewardship, trusting him with access to what had been Kiyoshi's.

The iron was cold. It would warm to his body's temperature.

---

## SCENE 022 | 06:35 | Main House - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Entrance area

Shoes. Jacket. The preparations for departure that had become automatic. Tenchi watched from the doorway, his expression a mixture of curiosity and concern.

"Can I come?"

"Not today. Today is for first meeting. You'll visit soon."

---

## SCENE 023 | 06:39 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Main path

The shrine grounds gleamed with morning light—dew on leaves, moisture on stone, the particular clarity of air that hadn't yet warmed. Sheldon and Katsuhito walked the main path together, their footsteps the only sound.

The mountain watched their departure.

---

## SCENE 024 | 06:45 | Shrine Grounds - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Shrine steps, beginning descent

The 320 steps waited, descent rather than climb. Easier on the body, harder on the mind—gravity assisted while anticipation intensified.

Sheldon began the descent with Katsuhito beside him.

---

## SCENE 025 | 06:52 | Forest Trail - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Forest path

The forest was waking around them—birds announcing territory, small animals rustling through undergrowth, the layered sounds of life resuming its daily activity. The path descended through this awakening world.

"The house is on the village's north side," Katsuhito said. "Near the stream."

---

## SCENE 026 | 06:58 | Forest Trail - Masaki Shrine
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Forest path

Near the stream. Water access. Good for a garden, Sheldon realized. Kiyoshi had chosen the location deliberately, optimizing for his passion.

A man revealed through his choices. Sheldon was learning to read the evidence.

---

## SCENE 027 | 07:04 | Village - Outskirts
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Village approach

The village emerged from forest as it always did—gradually, buildings appearing through trees, the transition from mountain wilderness to human settlement. But today Sheldon saw it differently.

Today he was seeing it as resident, not visitor.

---

## SCENE 028 | 07:08 | Village - Main Street
**Type:** Transition
**Location:** Village main street

The shops were opening, shutters rising, the rhythms of commerce beginning. Sheldon recognized faces now—the tofu maker, the hardware store owner. Some nodded. Some watched without acknowledgment.

The foreign inheritor, walking to claim his property.

---

## SCENE 029 | 07:12 | Village - North Side
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Village north approach

They turned north, away from the main street, following a narrower path that Sheldon hadn't walked before. The houses here were older, more widely spaced, gardens larger between them.

"This way," Katsuhito said, turning onto a path barely visible through spring growth.

---

## SCENE 030 | 07:16 | Village - Tsukino Property Approach
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

The path opened onto a clearing. Beyond it, partially obscured by overgrown vegetation, a house waited. Small, as Katsuhito had said. Traditional. And clearly, visibly, in need of attention.

Sheldon stopped. His heart rate elevated.

---

## SCENE 031 | 07:19 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tsukino house, front view

The house was single-story, its roof showing wear but not collapse. Walls of wood and plaster, the plaster cracked in places, the wood weathered to grey. Shutters closed against light that hadn't touched the interior in eighteen months.

Beautiful and broken. Waiting.

---

## SCENE 032 | 07:22 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tsukino house, garden view

The garden surrounded the house like an embrace. Plants had grown wild, their cultivated forms obscured by unchecked expansion. But the structure remained visible—beds, paths, the skeleton of what Kiyoshi had created.

The bones, as Katsuhito had promised. The bones remained.

---

## SCENE 033 | 07:25 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Tsukino house, approaching

Sheldon walked forward slowly, awareness heightened, each detail registering with unusual clarity. The crunch of gravel beneath his feet. The smell of growing things and decay. The presence of the house, waiting to receive him.

The keys warmed in his pocket from his body's heat.

---

## SCENE 034 | 07:28 | Tsukino House - Front Door
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Tsukino house, entrance

The front door was solid wood, darkened with age, slightly warped from seasons of moisture and dryness. A bronze handle, tarnished to green. The lock plate, worn smooth where hands had turned keys for years.

Kiyoshi's hands. Now Sheldon's would take their place.

---

## SCENE 035 | 07:31 | Tsukino House - Front Door
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tsukino house, entrance

The key fit. The lock turned with resistance—eighteen months of disuse, metal against metal, mechanisms remembering their function. A click. The door yielded.

Sheldon pushed it open and met the air that had been waiting inside.

---

## SCENE 036 | 07:34 | Tsukino House - Genkan
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tsukino house, entry

The smell was the first thing—dust, old wood, the particular mustiness of spaces long closed. Not unpleasant exactly, but intense. The air had aged in here, carrying the residue of a life now ended.

The genkan was small, traditional. Shoe space to the left, step up to the main floor.

---

## SCENE 037 | 07:37 | Tsukino House - Genkan
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Tsukino house, entry

Sheldon removed his shoes automatically, the habit established at the shrine transferring without thought. His stocking feet met old wood—solid, smooth, bearing the patina of years of similar contact.

Kiyoshi had stood here. Now Sheldon stood in the same place.

---

## SCENE 038 | 07:40 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tsukino house, main room

The main room opened beyond the entry—tatami flooring, paper screens filtering what light reached through closed shutters. Furniture draped with cloth. The shapes of a life preserved beneath protective covering.

Katsuhito remained at the threshold. This entrance belonged to Sheldon alone.

---

## SCENE 039 | 07:43 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tsukino house, main room

The room was perhaps twelve mats—modest but adequate for one person. A low table in the center, chairs or cushions beneath their draping. Shelves on one wall, their contents invisible. A scroll hanging in the alcove, its image faded.

Kiyoshi's choices, preserved in arrangement.

---

## SCENE 040 | 07:46 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Tsukino house, main room

The butsudan occupied its traditional place—the household shrine, smaller than the one at Masaki, but present. Sheldon approached it carefully, dust disturbed by his movement swirling in the dim light.

Ancestor tablets. Names he would need to learn.

---

## SCENE 041 | 07:49 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Tsukino house, at butsudan

The tablets were arranged in order—older ones at the back, more recent toward the front. Sheldon read the names slowly, his Japanese adequate for this simple task.

Tsukino Haruki. Tsukino Yuki. Tsukino Kiyoshi.

His grandparents. His mother. His uncle.

---

## SCENE 042 | 07:52 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tsukino house, at butsudan

The names made the family real in ways documentation hadn't. Haruki and Yuki had existed. They had lived, married, produced children. One of those children was Kiyoshi. One was supposedly his mother.

The tablets couldn't be fabricated. The dead were real.

---

## SCENE 043 | 07:55 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Relationship
**Location:** Tsukino house, at butsudan

Sheldon bowed to the shrine. The gesture emerged without conscious decision—respect for ancestors he hadn't known he had, acknowledgment of lives that had made his presence here possible.

"Thank you," he said quietly. "I will care for what you built."

---

## SCENE 044 | 07:58 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tsukino house, kitchen

The kitchen was small, traditional, equipped for one person's needs. A wood stove, smaller than the shrine's but similar in design. Cabinets with sliding doors. A window facing the garden, light filtering through accumulated grime.

Kiyoshi had cooked here. Sheldon would cook here.

---

## SCENE 045 | 08:01 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tsukino house, kitchen

The cabinets held dishes—bowls, plates, cups, the accumulated serviceware of decades. Simple patterns, well-made. Some chipped, some whole. Each piece chosen, each piece used.

Evidence of daily life. Evidence of sustained existence.

---

## SCENE 046 | 08:04 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Tsukino house, bedroom

The bedroom was separated from the main room by sliding screens. A futon storage closet. A low dresser. Personal effects he wasn't yet ready to examine.

This was where Kiyoshi had slept. Where Sheldon would sleep, eventually.

---

## SCENE 047 | 08:07 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Subplot
**Location:** Tsukino house, bedroom

The dresser top held a photograph. Sheldon approached it carefully, not touching, only looking. Two figures—a man and a woman, posed formally. The woman was perhaps forty; the man somewhat older.

Kiyoshi and someone. A wife, perhaps? A relative?

---

## SCENE 048 | 08:10 | Tsukino House - Back Door
**Type:** Main Plot
**Location:** Tsukino house, rear exit

The back door opened onto the garden. Sheldon used the second key, the lock similarly resistant, the door similarly yielding. He stepped onto a small porch and faced what had been Kiyoshi's pride.

The garden spread before him in wild profusion.

---

## SCENE 049 | 08:14 | Tsukino House - Garden
**Type:** Worldbuilding
**Location:** Tsukino house, garden

Overgrown didn't capture it. The garden had exploded—plants competing for light and space, paths barely visible, the stream's edge blurred by uncontrolled growth. But beneath the chaos, structure remained.

Beds with defined edges. Stepping stones. A small pond, its surface green with algae but its shape still discernible.

---

## SCENE 050 | 08:18 | Tsukino House - Garden
**Type:** Character Development
**Location:** Tsukino house, garden

Sheldon stood at the garden's edge and felt the weight of what he was inheriting. Not just a house, not just possessions—a man's life work. A soul made physical through years of patient cultivation.

His responsibility now. His to restore or to neglect.

He would not neglect it.
