# DAY 15 - APRIL 17, 1989 (MONDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 4: Scenes 151-200 (15:02-19:30)

---

## SCENE 151 | 15:06 | Shrine Compound (Near Main Hall)
**Type:** Relationship

Katsuhito was sweeping the stones before the main hall—a task Sheldon had seen repeated daily, the same motions clearing the same surface of the same leaves.

"Yamada-san?" Katsuhito asked without pausing his strokes.

"He'll look at the wheel. Tomorrow, after nine."

"Good."

---

## SCENE 152 | 15:10 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Character Development

The brevity of Katsuhito's approval carried weight. The old priest didn't waste words on matters resolved; his acknowledgment meant the approach had been correct.

Sheldon filed the validation away. Small successes accumulated into understanding.

---

## SCENE 153 | 15:14 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Main Plot

The cart waited where he'd left it. In afternoon light, the damage showed more clearly—the warped wheel, the split handle. Problems that had seemed abstract now required solving.

First: remove the wheel. The test Yamada had set.

---

## SCENE 154 | 15:18 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon examined the wheel attachment more closely. An axle pin held it in place—rusted but potentially moveable with the right leverage.

The tools on the wall offered options. He identified a pry bar, a mallet, something that might be a specialized wheel tool.

---

## SCENE 155 | 15:22 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

He selected the pry bar and positioned it against the axle pin. Applied pressure. Nothing moved.

More pressure. The rust held.

Brute force wasn't the answer. He stepped back, reconsidering.

---

## SCENE 156 | 15:26 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Physics applied to stuck mechanisms. The rust was bonding the surfaces. Heat would expand metal, potentially breaking the bond. Oil might penetrate and lubricate.

He looked for oil among the storage building's supplies.

---

## SCENE 157 | 15:30 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

A tin of machine oil on a back shelf—old but still liquid. He applied it generously around the axle pin, letting it seep into the gaps between metal surfaces.

Ten minutes, his instinct said. Let chemistry do its work before trying force again.

---

## SCENE 158 | 15:34 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Transition

While waiting for the oil to penetrate, Sheldon stepped outside. The afternoon was advancing toward evening, shadows lengthening across the compound.

Tenchi's voice carried from somewhere near the main house—playing, by the sound of it. The energy of childhood unbounded by adult concerns.

---

## SCENE 159 | 15:38 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

He returned to the cart. Applied the pry bar again.

This time, the pin shifted. Slightly, but perceptibly. Progress.

More oil. More waiting. More gradual application of force.

---

## SCENE 160 | 15:42 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Character Development

The pin released with a scraping sound that marked victory. Sheldon worked it free, metal grinding against metal, until it cleared the axle entirely.

The wheel could now be lifted from its mount.

---

## SCENE 161 | 15:46 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Main Plot

The wheel was heavier than expected—oak, probably, which meant the spokes might be salvageable. He carried it into better light, examining the damage.

Three spokes cracked but not split. The rim warped but not broken. Repairable, if Yamada confirmed his amateur assessment.

---

## SCENE 162 | 15:50 | Storage Building (Interior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The wheel's construction revealed craftsmanship from an earlier generation. Hand-fitted joints, no visible metal fasteners beyond the outer rim's iron band.

Someone had made this with skills that predated power tools. The work deserved respect, and proper repair.

---

## SCENE 163 | 15:54 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Transition

Sheldon carried the wheel to a clear area and set it upright against the building's wall. Tomorrow he'd carry it down the mountain to Yamada's workshop.

320 steps with a cart wheel. The logistics were manageable.

---

## SCENE 164 | 15:58 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Relationship

"You freed it." Katsuhito had approached silently—his particular skill of appearing without announcement.

"Oil and patience."

"The two solve most problems."

The aphorism had the weight of lived experience.

---

## SCENE 165 | 16:02 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Character Development

Standing with Katsuhito, looking at the removed wheel, Sheldon felt the quiet satisfaction of competence earned.

He'd identified a problem, researched a solution, executed the steps, achieved the goal. The scale was trivial; the pattern was transferable.

---

## SCENE 166 | 16:06 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Subplot

"The house," Katsuhito said. "You visited again."

Not a question. The old priest knew things without being told.

"Just from the road. Looking."

"Looking is preparation. The eye sees what it expects to work on."

---

## SCENE 167 | 16:10 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The comment lingered as they walked toward the main house. Was he preparing? His visits to the Tsukino property had felt more like pilgrimage than planning.

But perhaps the distinction was artificial. Every look gathered information. Every observation shaped intent.

---

## SCENE 168 | 16:14 | Main House (Entrance)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The main house showed signs of evening preparation—the kitchen fire already lit, the smell of rice beginning to steam.

Monday evening. The weekend visitors had departed, leaving the shrine to its residents.

---

## SCENE 169 | 16:18 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon offered to help with dinner—the gesture now expected rather than exceptional. Katsuhito assigned him vegetable preparation: daikon to be peeled and sliced, greens to be washed.

Tasks he'd learned over two weeks, hands now knowing the motions.

---

## SCENE 170 | 16:22 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Relationship

Tenchi appeared in the kitchen doorway, drawn by activity.

"The wheel came off?"

"It did."

"Can I see?"

"After dinner. It's not going anywhere."

The delayed gratification was accepted with the minimal protest of a well-taught child.

---

## SCENE 171 | 16:26 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The kitchen filled with the sounds of meal preparation: knife on cutting board, water heating, the low murmur of Katsuhito explaining something to Tenchi about the next day's schedule.

Domestic rhythms that had become Sheldon's own through repetition.

---

## SCENE 172 | 16:30 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Character Development

The daikon peeled in long spirals—a technique Katsuhito had demonstrated, requiring steady hands and consistent pressure. Sheldon's early attempts had been ragged; now the ribbons fell cleanly.

Progress measured in vegetable preparation. The humbling scale of daily competence.

---

## SCENE 173 | 16:34 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Main Plot

"Tomorrow I take the wheel to Yamada-san," Sheldon said. "I may be gone much of the day."

Katsuhito nodded. "The gravel can wait. Learning cannot."

The permission was granted without negotiation. Priorities understood.

---

## SCENE 174 | 16:38 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Learning cannot wait. The phrase echoed older wisdom—his grandmother's belief that useful knowledge should never be deferred.

She would have approved of this approach. Show up, ask, watch, practice. The method was universal across cultures.

---

## SCENE 175 | 16:42 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Transition

The meal assembled itself through coordinated effort. Rice portioned, soup ladled, vegetables arranged. Sheldon carried dishes to the dining area while Tenchi managed the smaller items—chopsticks, napkins, cups.

A household functioning as organism.

---

## SCENE 176 | 16:46 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Relationship

They ate with the comfortable silence of people who didn't require conversation to share space.

Tenchi, predictably, broke first: "The wheel goes to get fixed?"

"To get looked at. Then maybe fixed."

"What if it can't be fixed?"

"Then we learn that too."

---

## SCENE 177 | 16:50 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Character Development

The answer satisfied something in Tenchi's four-year-old logic. Not everything could be fixed, but you had to look first to know.

Sheldon recognized the philosophy as one he was still learning to apply. Examination before assumption.

---

## SCENE 178 | 16:54 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The meal was simpler than weekend fare—rice, miso, the vegetables Sheldon had prepared, pickles from a jar that seemed to replenish itself.

Monday modesty after Sunday's slight elaboration. The week had its own dietary rhythm.

---

## SCENE 179 | 16:58 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Main Plot

"The eastern gravel deposit," Katsuhito said. "You should see it before deciding on the cart."

"Distance?"

"A fifteen-minute walk from the steps. Steep terrain. The cart would need modification for the slope."

New information that changed calculations.

---

## SCENE 180 | 17:02 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon revised his mental map. Fifteen minutes from the steps, steep terrain—that meant significant elevation change. A loaded cart on a slope required braking capability the current design might lack.

The repair project had just expanded.

---

## SCENE 181 | 17:06 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Every solution revealed new problems. The cart's wheel needed fixing, but the cart's design might need modification. The gravel was available, but accessing it required engineering.

Complexity layered on complexity. The only way through was incremental progress.

---

## SCENE 182 | 17:10 | Main House (Dining Area)
**Type:** Relationship

"I'll mention the slope to Yamada-san," Sheldon said. "He may have suggestions."

"Yamada built carts for the mountain farmers before roads improved. He knows the problems."

Another layer of the carpenter's expertise revealed. Sheldon was glad he'd approached respectfully.

---

## SCENE 183 | 17:14 | Main House (Kitchen)
**Type:** Transition

Cleanup followed eating—the reciprocal of preparation. Sheldon washed while Katsuhito dried, the division of labor now automatic.

Tenchi swept crumbs with his child-sized broom, serious about his contribution.

---

## SCENE 184 | 17:18 | Main House (Hallway)
**Type:** Relationship

Post-meal, Tenchi claimed his promised viewing. "The wheel now?"

Sheldon looked to Katsuhito, who nodded permission.

"The wheel now."

They walked together toward the storage building, Tenchi's shorter stride requiring accommodation.

---

## SCENE 185 | 17:22 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Main Plot

The wheel waited where Sheldon had left it, oak surface golden in the evening light.

Tenchi approached with the reverence children sometimes show for objects that seemed important to adults.

"It's big," he said.

"Bigger than a bicycle wheel."

"Much bigger."

---

## SCENE 186 | 17:26 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Relationship

Sheldon pointed to the damaged spokes. "See these cracks? The wood is old. It needs repair."

Tenchi traced one crack with a careful finger. "Does it hurt?"

The question revealed a four-year-old's animism—objects as beings that could feel.

"The wood doesn't hurt. But it can't work properly until it's fixed."

---

## SCENE 187 | 17:30 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Character Development

Explaining the wheel to Tenchi required simplification without condescension. The balance was instructive—if he couldn't explain it simply, perhaps he didn't understand it well enough himself.

"The spokes hold the wheel's shape. When they crack, the wheel gets wobbly."

Tenchi nodded, processing.

---

## SCENE 188 | 17:34 | Storage Building (Exterior)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The evening air had cooled, mountain altitude asserting itself as the sun declined.

Birds were beginning their dusk calls—different species than the dawn chorus, Sheldon had noticed. The mountain's soundtrack shifted with the hours.

---

## SCENE 189 | 17:38 | Shrine Compound
**Type:** Transition

They walked back toward the main house, Tenchi carrying a stick he'd found along the way—essential equipment for any four-year-old expedition.

The shrine compound held the particular peace of evening, work completed, night approaching.

---

## SCENE 190 | 17:42 | Main House (Engawa)
**Type:** Relationship

Katsuhito sat on the engawa, watching the sky transition through shades of amber and pink.

"Grandfather, we saw the wheel!" Tenchi announced.

"And what did you learn?"

"It has cracks that make it wobbly."

"A good understanding."

---

## SCENE 191 | 17:46 | Main House (Engawa)
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon joined them on the engawa, the wooden boards still warm from the day's sun.

The three of them—old man, child, stranger—had become something like a family through the accident of circumstance. The shape of it still surprised him.

---

## SCENE 192 | 17:50 | Main House (Engawa)
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Family was a word that had never fit comfortably in his life. His parents' distance, his grandmother's presence, his academic isolation—none of it matched the cultural template.

Here, something different was forming. Not replacement but addition. New connections alongside old absences.

---

## SCENE 193 | 17:54 | Main House (Engawa)
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The first stars emerged as twilight deepened. Different constellations than Alaska's sky—the same stars rearranged by latitude into unfamiliar patterns.

He'd have to learn them. The night sky was another language waiting for translation.

---

## SCENE 194 | 17:58 | Main House (Interior)
**Type:** Transition

Tenchi's energy flagged as darkness settled. His eyes grew heavy despite protests of alertness.

"Bath time," Katsuhito said. "Then bed."

"I'm not tired."

"Your eyes disagree."

---

## SCENE 195 | 18:02 | Main House (Hallway)
**Type:** Relationship

Sheldon watched Katsuhito guide the protesting child toward the family's private bathhouse—different from the guest facilities Sheldon used.

The exclusion was appropriate. Some spaces remained family-only, and he was still guest.

---

## SCENE 196 | 18:06 | Guest Room
**Type:** Character Development

Alone in his room, Sheldon reviewed the day's accomplishments. Gravel work, carpenter connection, wheel removal, Tsukino house observation.

Four separate progressions, each incrementally advanced. The rhythm of productive days.

---

## SCENE 197 | 18:10 | Guest Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Tomorrow's tasks arranged themselves: carry wheel to Yamada's, learn what could be learned, potentially scout the eastern gravel deposit if time permitted.

The plans existed in rough form, subject to revision based on reality's input.

---

## SCENE 198 | 18:14 | Guest Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Through the shoji screens, the compound settled into night. Distant sounds of the village below—a dog, a vehicle, voices too faint to distinguish.

The mountain's darkness was deeper than any city, the absence of electric light allowing stars their full expression.

---

## SCENE 199 | 18:18 | Guest Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Two weeks and two days. Fifteen sunrises in this place that had become, incrementally, his place.

The identity of scholar remained, but new identities layered over it: worker, student, neighbor. The accumulated weight of days spent differently.

---

## SCENE 200 | 18:22 | Guest Room
**Type:** Character Development

Sheldon prepared for sleep—the evening rituals that had replaced his American habits. Futon unrolled, clothing folded, mind releasing the day's concerns into the darkness.

Tomorrow would bring its own requirements. Tonight demanded only rest.
