**Type:** Worldbuilding

Katsuhito announced afternoon plans: "Tenchi and I will visit the village. He needs new sandals—the current pair is outgrown."

"I'll work at the house, then. Preparation for Nishida's assessment."

---

## SCENE 105 | 11:29 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Main Plot

"Can I come to Sheldon-san's house instead?"

"New sandals are important. You can visit the house another day."

The child accepted the logic, the distraction of village trip adequate compensation.

---

## SCENE 106 | 11:33 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Relationship

"What will you do at the house?"

"Clear access to the roof. Nishida will need to see everything. The preparation makes his work easier."

"Grown-up work?"

"Grown-up work. Important but not exciting."

---

## SCENE 107 | 11:37 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Subplot

The division of afternoon labor established—each member with purpose, the household functioning as distributed system.

---

## SCENE 108 | 11:41 | Main House - Genkan
**Type:** Transition

Departures: Katsuhito and Tenchi down the steps toward the village, Sheldon toward the forest path.

The shrine temporarily empty, the grounds trusted to maintain themselves.

---

## SCENE 109 | 11:45 | Path to Tsukino House
**Type:** Main Plot

The forest path in afternoon light, the familiar route navigated without conscious thought.

Body memory operating, mind free to process other matters.

---

## SCENE 110 | 11:49 | Path to Tsukino House
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Nishida's assessment would determine scope and cost. The roof's condition visible but not fully evaluated.

Professional eyes would see what amateur observation missed.

---

## SCENE 111 | 11:53 | Path to Tsukino House - Stream
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Twenty-three days of travel embedding the route into reflexive knowledge.

---

## SCENE 112 | 11:57 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Character Development

The house received him with its patient presence—the structure waiting for the attention that would restore it.

"Good afternoon. I've come to prepare for the assessment."

The greeting reflexive now, the speaking to the house normalized.

---

## SCENE 113 | 12:01 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

The first task: clear paths around the exterior perimeter. Nishida would need to circle the building, assess from multiple angles.

Overgrowth trimmed. Debris removed. Access optimized.

---

## SCENE 114 | 12:05 | Tsukino House - North Side
**Type:** Subplot

The north side—worst damage visible—required particular attention.

Fallen branches cleared, the damaged thatch sections fully exposed to view.

---

## SCENE 115 | 12:09 | Tsukino House - North Side

The damage more extensive than initial estimates. Water staining on exterior walls indicated prolonged infiltration.

The interior damage would correspond.

---

## SCENE 116 | 12:13 | Tsukino House - North Side
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Structural versus cosmetic. The distinction that would determine feasibility.

If the posts and beams remained sound—Nobuyuki had confirmed this—then restoration remained viable.

Surface damage healed. Structural damage killed.

---

## SCENE 117 | 12:17 | Tsukino House - East Side

The assessment proceeding systematically—the physicist's training applied to building evaluation.

Observe. Document. Correlate. Conclude.

---

## SCENE 127 | 12:57 | Tsukino House - Kitchen Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The kitchen: worst interior damage. The floor joists visible through gaps in compromised flooring.

Moisture damage extensive. This section would require complete rebuild.

---

## SCENE 128 | 13:01 | Tsukino House - Kitchen Area
**Type:** Subplot

The scope expanded with each observation. The initial estimates inadequate to full reality.

But scope expansion didn't change feasibility—it changed timeline and cost.

---

## SCENE 129 | 13:05 | Tsukino House - Kitchen Area
**Type:** Character Development

He documented the damage mentally, the observations accumulating into assessment.

Nishida would provide professional validation. The preparation ensured productive consultation.

---

## SCENE 130 | 13:09 | Tsukino House - Rear Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The rear area—sleeping quarters in traditional layout—showed moderate damage.

Roof leakage present but less severe. The tatami frames salvageable.

---

## SCENE 131 | 13:13 | Tsukino House - Rear Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The house's biography written in its damage patterns. Decades of deferred maintenance, gradual deterioration, the cascade of neglect.

Reversible. Expensive. But reversible.

---

## SCENE 132 | 13:17 | Tsukino House - Attic Access
**Type:** Main Plot

The attic access point—a ceiling panel that lifted to reveal the roof structure.

He needed to see what lay above.

---

## SCENE 133 | 13:21 | Tsukino House - Attic Access
**Type:** Subplot

The ladder improvised from stored materials—secure enough for brief ascent.

The ceiling panel removed, the attic darkness waiting.

---

## SCENE 134 | 13:25 | Tsukino House - Attic
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The attic revealed itself through adjusted vision: the roof structure from below, the damage visible as light penetration.

Multiple points of failure. The thatch had deteriorated unevenly.

---

## SCENE 135 | 13:29 | Tsukino House - Attic
**Type:** Character Development

But the structural beams—the framework holding the thatch—appeared sound.

Cedar, old-growth, dimensionally stable despite decades of exposure.

---

## SCENE 136 | 13:33 | Tsukino House - Attic
**Type:** Main Plot

The assessment aligned with Nobuyuki's evaluation: structure sound, surface compromised.

The repair would be extensive but not fundamental. Replacement, not reconstruction.

---

## SCENE 137 | 13:37 | Tsukino House - Attic
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Relief accompanied the observation. The worst-case scenario—structural failure requiring partial demolition—was not manifesting.

The house wanted to be saved. It was cooperating.

---

## SCENE 138 | 13:41 | Tsukino House - Attic
**Type:** Subplot

He descended carefully, the improvised ladder requiring caution.

The attic survey complete, the preparation for Nishida advancing.

---

The property spreading before him, the potential visible beneath the neglect.

---

## SCENE 142 | 13:57 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The garden particularly—hints of formal design beneath overgrowth.

Someone had planned this space with intention. The intention waited for resurrection.

---

## SCENE 143 | 14:01 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Worldbuilding

He walked the garden's ghost paths, identifying rock placements, water feature remnants, the skeleton of deliberate design.

Japanese garden principles expressed through this specific terrain.

---

## SCENE 144 | 14:05 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The garden restoration would follow the building restoration—exterior after interior, aesthetics after function.

But understanding the design now would inform later work.

---

## SCENE 145 | 14:09 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Subplot

A stone lantern discovered beneath vine growth—carved, intact, quality craftsmanship.

The property revealing its treasures as the work progressed.

---

## SCENE 146 | 14:13 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Character Development
