### Scene 1.1: The Awakening
**14:47 — Chrysanthemum field near Shiroato ruins**

The first thing was grass.

Not the sensation of it"”that came second, the cool pressure of individual blades against his left cheek, the slight dampness where morning dew had not yet burned away. The first thing was the smell. Green and alive and impossibly clean, filling his nostrils with each shallow breath, carrying undertones of turned earth and something floral he couldn't immediately place. The scent triggered a cascade of association: summer lawns, childhood afternoons, his grandmother's backyard in Jackson where the grass grew thick enough to lose marbles in.

He did not move.

His body lay pressed into soil that gave slightly beneath his weight, and his mind floated somewhere above it, not yet ready to engage with the question of why he was lying face-down in grass when he should not be lying anywhere at all. The disconnect between sensation and comprehension created a buffer zone, a momentary reprieve during which he could simply exist without having to process what existence currently meant.

The last thing he remembered was the laboratory.

The memory surfaced with reluctance, like something heavy being dragged up from deep water. The containment field had been fluctuating for three hours. Dr. Morrison"”nervous, always nervous, his hands never quite still when the readings danced near acceptable thresholds"”had suggested shutting down twice, and twice Sheldon had talked him back from the edge. They were close. The funding committee needed results before the quarterly review. The experimental drive core sat in its housing like a star that had been talked into behaving, dense with potential energy, humming at frequencies that made Sheldon's back teeth ache.

Then the magnetic coils had failed.

Not gradually. Not with the warning signs that theory predicted and training prepared you for. One moment the readings were elevated but manageable, oscillating in patterns Sheldon had learned to read the way sailors read waves. The next moment every alarm in the facility was screaming, and the light inside the containment unit was shifting from controlled blue to something wilder, whiter, hungrier"”the color of a star remembering what it was supposed to be.

He remembered turning toward the viewport. He remembered Maria Chen's face through the glass, her hand frozen halfway to the emergency cutoff, her mouth open in a scream he couldn't hear over the alarms. He remembered the sensation of heat against his skin, far too much heat far too fast, the air itself becoming hostile.

He remembered knowing.

The numbers had been in his head"”they were always in his head, the curse and gift of a mind that couldn't stop calculating"”and the numbers said there was no surviving what was about to happen. The energy release would vaporize everything within fifty meters. The cascade had already begun. There was no stopping it, no outrunning it, no clever last-second solution that would let him walk away with a story for conferences. There was only the light, growing brighter, and a strange calm settling over him like a blanket.

He'd had time to think *oh*.

Not fear. Recognition. The quiet acknowledgment of a fact that could not be argued with. He was dying, and there was nothing to be done about it, and the part of his brain that had spent thirty-eight years solving problems had finally encountered one it couldn't solve.

The light had taken him.

---

And then"”

Something else.

The memory was harder to hold, slippery in ways the laboratory memories weren't. Between the light and the grass, between the dying and the lying here, there had been... something. Not darkness, because darkness implied space for light to be absent from. Not silence, because silence implied the possibility of sound. Something outside the categories his mind wanted to sort experience into.

Warmth.

That was the closest word, though it captured almost nothing of what he half-remembered. Not the warmth of the containment failure, which had been violent and consuming and very specifically about temperature. This was different. Gentle. Encompassing. Like being wrapped in something soft that didn't register as heat but registered as *safe*"”the way his grandmother's arms had registered as safe when he was small enough to fit entirely inside her embrace.

There had been something else in that warmth. A presence. Vast and patient and achingly kind, gathering the scattered fragments of his existence with the tenderness of someone collecting shattered glass, careful not to lose a single piece. He couldn't see it"”couldn't see anything, existing in a state that didn't include vision as a category"”but he could feel it the way you felt someone watching you from across a room. Attention that was not intrusive. Concern that was not conditional.

And there had been... not sound, exactly. A resonance. A chime-like frequency that vibrated through whatever remained of him, carrying meaning that bypassed language entirely. A frequency that said, without saying: *you are seen. You are held. You are not alone.*

Something like wings. He remembered something like wings"”vast and soft, made of light that didn't burn, wrapping around him with infinite gentleness. And a message, not in words but in impression, settling into whatever served as his consciousness:

*Live well. I will find you when I can.*

Then the warmth had released him, gently, into"”

Grass. And the smell of growing things. And a body that was lying face-down in a field in a place that was emphatically not Alaska.

---

Sheldon opened his eyes.

The world resolved itself in layers: green first, the close-up geometry of individual grass blades rising from dark soil. Then blue, a strip of sky visible at the edge of his vision, saturated and warm in a way that Alaska's sky never was. Then white, dozens of small white flowers growing among the grass, their petals catching the afternoon light.

He lay still for another moment, cataloging sensations. Heart beating"”that seemed significant. Lungs working"”significant too. The dead, as a general rule, did not have heartbeats or working lungs. These facts suggested a conclusion that his rational mind kept sliding away from, unwilling to commit to an assertion so thoroughly outside the boundaries of established physics.

He moved his fingers first. An experimental flex, testing whether his body still answered to commands. His right hand was resting palm-down in the grass beside his head, and his fingers curled and uncurled smoothly, each joint articulating without resistance or complaint. No pain. No stiffness. No indication that anything was wrong.

He moved his other hand. Same result. Then his toes, inside shoes he didn't remember putting on. Then his arms, pressing against the ground, beginning the slow process of pushing himself upward.

The motion was too easy.

Sheldon had lived in his body for thirty-eight years. He knew its rhythms, its responses, the particular way his muscles engaged when he pushed himself up from the ground. He kept himself in condition"”always had, his grandmother's voice in his head reminding him that a man who couldn't take care of his own body couldn't be trusted to take care of anything else. Getting up wasn't difficult for him. It was just *familiar*. The specific recruitment pattern of core and arms, the shift of weight, the momentary tension before momentum took over.

This wasn't familiar.

His body simply rose, flowing from prone to sitting to standing with a fluidity that felt *new*. Not better than before"”his old body had worked fine"”but different. Smoother. Like the difference between a well-maintained car and one fresh off the assembly line. Both functional, but one had never been driven.

He stood in the field and looked at his hands.

They were his hands. He knew them the way he knew his own face in the mirror: the short fingers, the broad palms, the particular shade of brown that darkened across his knuckles and lightened in the creases of his joints. He had spent three decades watching these hands hold tools and write equations, calibrate instruments and cook his grandmother's recipes. These were absolutely, unmistakably his hands.

But they were wrong.

He turned his right hand over, examining the palm. The skin was smooth and unmarked, the lines of fate and life etched cleanly into flesh that looked like it had never been used. No calluses from years of gripping equipment. No small scars from the accumulated minor accidents of laboratory work.

The pad of his right thumb was smooth.

He stared at it. The thin white scar should have been there"”the one from the apple incident when he was eight. He'd been helping his grandmother make a pie, showing off how well he could peel without looking, and the paring knife had slipped. Blood everywhere. Crying. His grandmother pressing a dish towel tight against the cut while she walked him to the bathroom, her voice calm and practical even as the white cloth turned red. *It's all right, baby. Cuts bleed a lot but they heal fast. You're going to be fine.*

The scar had been there for thirty years. A thin white line across the pad, barely visible but always present, a permanent reminder of the day he'd learned that showing off had consequences.

Gone.

He pushed up his sleeves and checked his forearms. The burn mark from the soldering accident in Kyoto, the one that had left a patch of shiny skin the size of a quarter. Gone. The weird discoloration on his right wrist that he'd stopped bothering to ask doctors about. Gone.

His body was the same shape"”short, stocky, familiar, five foot four and built like his grandfather had been built, compact and dense, what his grandmother had called *sturdy* and his college roommate had called *hobbit-like*. But it had been... reset. Cleaned. Like someone had taken the original blueprints and manufactured a fresh copy, keeping the essential architecture while removing all evidence of use.

He was standing in a body that felt like his but wasn't quite.

---

Something pressed against his left wrist.

He'd felt it since waking"”a slight weight, a band of pressure"”but his mind had been occupied with larger impossibilities. Now he looked down.

A watch.

Silver-toned case, maybe thirty millimeters across. White face with black hands and small black numerals at the hours. The second hand swept smoothly around the dial, not ticking in discrete jumps but gliding in the continuous motion of a mechanical movement. A brown leather strap, worn soft with apparent use, buckled comfortably around his wrist.

2:47 PM.

Sheldon stared at it.

He hadn't been wearing a watch when he died. His old Casio digital had died three years ago"”he'd been meaning to replace it but never got around to it, his phone serving well enough for timekeeping. And this wasn't the kind of watch he would have bought anyway. Too elegant. Too traditional. The kind of thing his grandfather might have worn, the kind of thing that required daily winding and attention rather than batteries and benign neglect.

Someone had buckled this to his wrist.

The realization arrived with a strange weight. While he was unconscious"”while he was *dead*, or whatever state preceded waking up in this field"”someone had taken this watch and wrapped the leather strap around his wrist and pushed the buckle pin through the hole and secured it there. An intimate act. The kind of thing you did for a child who couldn't dress themselves, or for a patient who couldn't manage fine motor tasks.

The kind of thing you did for someone you were taking care of.

He touched the crystal with his fingertip. Solid. Real. Warm from the sun and from his own body heat.

---

The white flowers surrounded him.

He noticed them properly now, looking beyond the immediate circle of disturbed grass where he'd been lying. They grew everywhere"”dozens, hundreds, carpeting the field in clusters that caught the afternoon light. Small blooms, each with layers of delicate petals arranged in circular patterns, their centers yellow against the white.

Chrysanthemums. The word surfaced from somewhere in his memory. White chrysanthemums.

He didn't know why the identification felt significant. They were just flowers. Pretty, in an understated way, but just flowers. His grandmother had grown them in her garden, he remembered suddenly. Had complained about the deer eating them. Had cut them for arrangements on the dining room table, white against the dark wood, formal and somehow solemn.

The field stretched around him in a gentle slope, chrysanthemums and grass giving way to rice paddies below and forested hills above. In the distance"”maybe a hundred meters uphill"”he could see the remnants of old stone foundations, overgrown with vegetation but still visibly artificial. The ruins of something. A castle, maybe, or a large estate. The kind of structure that accumulated in the Japanese countryside over centuries, built and abandoned and slowly reclaimed by the land.

The sight tugged at something in his mind, but he couldn't articulate what.

---

He patted his pockets.

The action was automatic, the instinctive check for wallet and keys that urban life had trained into him. His hands found fabric"”dark slacks, the kind he would have worn to work, professional but not formal"”and within the fabric, objects. Something soft in his right front pocket. The clink of metal in his left. A familiar weight in his back right.

He started with the right front pocket. His fingers touched fabric within fabric"”cloth, folded with geometric precision. He pulled it out.

A handkerchief.

White cotton. High thread count, the kind that felt substantial between his fingers. Folded into a neat square with sharp creases, each edge aligned perfectly with the others. The kind of handkerchief his grandmother had ironed every Sunday evening, standing at the board in her kitchen while the radio played gospel and the smell of Sunday dinner lingered in the air.

*A man should always carry a handkerchief, baby. You never know when you'll need to wipe your face or help a lady with her tears or clean up a mess you've made.*

He'd carried one through high school. Through college. Through his first two doctoral programs. Somewhere during the third"”Caltech, the quantum mechanics years, when he'd been so deep in equations that he sometimes forgot to eat"”he'd stopped. Too much trouble. Too old-fashioned. One more piece of the Jackson boy he'd been trying to leave behind in the pursuit of becoming a theoretical physicist.

Now here was a handkerchief in his pocket, white and pressed and folded exactly the way his grandmother had taught him.

As if someone knew. As if someone remembered.

He refolded it carefully, matching the creases, and slipped it back into his pocket.

The left pocket yielded coins. A handful of yen"”he recognized the shapes even before pulling them out"”in various denominations. One-hundred yen pieces, fifty-yen coins with holes in the center, smaller tens and fives. Pocket change. The kind of money you'd carry for vending machines and small purchases, unremarkable and useful.

The back pocket held the wallet.

He pulled it out and held it in his hands. Brown leather, bi-fold, the kind that fit Japanese yen notes without folding them. Worn at the edges in a pattern that suggested years of daily use, softened from apparent handling. Not his wallet"”his wallet had been black synthetic, bought at a Target in Berkeley because the old one had finally fallen apart. This was something else. Something given.

He opened it.

---

Money first. His eyes went there automatically, the learned reflex of a man who had grown up watching his grandmother count bills at the kitchen table, who had learned early that money was survival and you always knew exactly how much you had.

Bills, neatly arranged. He pulled them out and counted.

Yen. Japanese yen. Ten-thousand-yen notes"”five of them"”crisp but not new, the kind of bills that had circulated for a while, that wouldn't draw attention when spent. Behind them, smaller denominations: five-thousands and thousands for daily use.

Fifty thousand yen in large bills, plus perhaps another fifteen thousand in smaller notes. Someone had thought about this. Someone had understood that you couldn't walk into a rural shop with a ten-thousand-yen note and expect not to draw stares.

He didn't know exactly what that meant in dollar terms, but it was substantial. Enough to survive on for weeks if he was careful.

*Someone is taking care of me.*

The thought arrived with the same strange weight as the watch. Practical care. Thoughtful provision. The actions of someone who understood what a person needed to exist in the world and had arranged for those needs to be met.

He looked at the card slots.

An identification card sat in the front slot, positioned to be visible through a small plastic window. He slid it out and examined it.

The format was immediately recognizable: an Alien Registration Certificate, the document all foreign residents in Japan were required to carry. He'd had one during his postdoc years in Kyoto, had renewed it annually, had learned to keep it on his person at all times because the police could"”and occasionally did"”stop foreigners to check documentation.

This card had his face on it. His face, but younger"”thirty, maybe, matching whatever age his body had been reset to"”in a small color photograph against a white background. The same features he'd seen in mirrors for decades, but without the lines around the eyes, without the gray at his temples, without the particular weathering that thirty-eight years of living had accumulated.

The text was in Japanese, but he read it without conscious effort, the meaning arriving simultaneously with the visual recognition of the characters:

**Name:** 月野 シェルドン (Tsukino Sheldon)  
**Nationality:** ã‚¢ãƒ¡ãƒªã‚«åˆè¡†å›½ (United States of America)  
**Date of Birth:** 1959年3月15日 (March 15, 1959)  
**Status of Residence:** æ°¸ä½è€… (Permanent Resident)  
**Date of Registration:** 1987年4月 (April 1987)

He read the birth date twice. Three times. The numbers refused to rearrange themselves into something that made sense.

March 15, 1959.

He'd been born August 21, 1987. He'd died October 23, 2025, at thirty-eight years old.

This document said he was thirty.

Someone had made him younger. Eight years younger than he'd been when he died. The body he was standing in wasn't just reset"”it was *revised*, aged backward to a point he barely remembered, to the version of himself that had existed before the accumulated wear of late thirties had begun to settle into his joints and his metabolism and his face.

He looked at his hands again. At his forearms. At the smooth skin where scars should have been. The absence of evidence wasn't just about healing"”it was about time. He was inhabiting a body that had never lived through the years that would have created those marks.

Thirty years old. In a body that matched the documentation perfectly.

He slid the registration card back into its slot and kept looking.

---

Behind the cash, pressed into a pocket clearly designed for them: bankbooks. Two of them, their covers worn, one from a regional bank he didn't recognize and one from Japan Post. He opened the first and scanned the transaction records"”deposits, withdrawals, a balance that made no sense for someone who had spent most of his career on postdoc stipends. Five hundred thousand yen. The postal savings book showed another two hundred ninety-seven thousand.

Nearly eight hundred thousand yen in accessible funds. Years of modest salary, saved and waiting for him.

Someone had built him a financial history.

Behind the bankbooks, more documents. He pulled them out one at a time, unfolding them carefully, reading each with the methodical attention of someone cataloging evidence.

A *koseki tohon*"”an excerpt from the family register. Official stamps, formal language, the genealogical documentation that Japanese bureaucracy required for everything from marriage to property transfer. It traced his connection to the Tsukino family of Okayama Prefecture, establishing him as the son of Tsukino Yuki and an American father named James Carter. There were other names too"”grandparents, aunts, uncles"”a web of family relations he had never lived but that apparently existed in whatever records someone had created.

And at the bottom of the stack, folded small but handled often enough to wear soft at the edges: a photograph.

He unfolded it carefully.

An elderly Japanese man stood in front of a traditional wooden house, the architecture immediately recognizable as rural and historical. Behind him, the house rose in weathered elegance"”dark wood, paper screens, the heavy tile roof of a building that had stood for generations. The man was small and slight, his face mapped with wrinkles, his posture slightly bent but his eyes sharp even in the photograph.

Sheldon had never seen him before. But the photograph had been carried. Had been looked at. Had been touched by fingers that cared about the face it showed.

This was someone's family. This was *his* family, according to every document in this wallet. A fabricated history that felt more real than fabrication should feel, complete with financial records and official stamps and a photograph worn soft from handling.

---

The envelope was heavier than he'd expected.

He'd been treating it as another document"”another piece of the carefully constructed paperwork that filled this wallet"”but when he pulled it from the inner pocket, he felt the weight of multiple pages. The address on the front was written in careful Japanese characters, addressed to "Tsukino Sheldon" at what appeared to be a California address. A forwarding label covered part of it, redirecting to somewhere else"”a property management company, from the look of the corporate stamp.

The flap was unsealed. Someone had opened this, read it, and tucked it back into the envelope. Someone who was supposed to be him.

He pulled out the contents. Two sheets. The first was a full page of handwritten Japanese, dated February 18, 1989"”six weeks ago, if the system's date was accurate. The second was shorter, more formal, with a red seal stamped at the bottom.

He read the longer letter first.

---

*Dear Sheldon,*

*I received your letter last week and read it three times. Haruko cried. She has been worried about you since Yuki passed, and to hear that you are finally coming home"”yes, I will call it home, because it is"”has lifted a weight from both of us.*

The words swam for a moment before settling into meaning. *Uncle Kiyoshi.* The name from the return address, the name from the family register. His mother's brother. A man who apparently existed, who apparently cared, who had apparently been corresponding with "Sheldon" for years.

*Four years. I know they have not been easy years. First your mother, then Michiko-obasan, then all the paperwork that follows death like crows follow a harvest. You wrote that settling the California estate took longer than you expected. I am not surprised. Your mother kept everything, and she owned more than you knew. The house, the investments, the storage unit you mentioned"”Yuki was always preparing for difficulties that might never come. She learned that from our mother, who learned it from the war.*

Sheldon's throat tightened.

The cadence was wrong"”this wasn't his grandmother, wasn't Dorothy Mae with her Georgia drawl and her practical wisdom"”but the sentiment was the same. A mother who prepared for difficulties. Who kept everything. Who learned caution from hardship and passed it down through generations.

*I am glad you decided to rent the California house rather than sell it. Property is security. Your mother would approve.*

He had property in California. Rental property. Income, presumably, flowing into accounts he'd never opened from tenants he'd never met. The constructed life grew more elaborate with every line.

*You asked about the Tsukino house. I visited last autumn with Masaru to check on things. The roof needs work"”there is a leak in the northeast corner that has damaged the ceiling of the back room. The kitchen is old but functional. Michiko-obasan kept the place clean until her illness, but eleven years empty is eleven years empty. You will need to hire workers for the roof. I can recommend a man in Kamogata if you need a name"”Yamamoto Toshiro, he did work for the shrine years ago and is honest.*

Practical information. Names. A roofer called Yamamoto. A shrine. Kamogata"”that must be the village. The letter was providing exactly what he would need to navigate a place he'd never been, to fix a house he'd never seen, to exist as a person he'd never been.

*The shop building is still sound. Michiko-obasan's husband ran the grocery there until he died, and she kept the structure maintained even after she closed it. You mentioned in your letter that you have ideas for the space. I look forward to hearing them.*

Ideas for the space. Apparently he"”the other Sheldon, the constructed one"”had plans. Had written about them. Had shared ambitions with an uncle who cared enough to ask.

*The village remembers the Tsukino family. When I visited, old Haruna-san at the grocery asked after you. She remembers when you came for Michiko-obasan's funeral. "The American nephew," she called you. "Polite. Quiet. Good Japanese." You made an impression. The village will welcome you back.*

He had been here before. In 1986, apparently, for a funeral he didn't attend, making impressions on people he'd never met. The constructed history included not just documents but *memories*"”other people's memories of a Sheldon who had walked these roads, spoken these words, existed in this place.

*About your plans: I understand the need for rest. You worked yourself nearly to death at that laboratory"”I could hear it in your letters, even when you did not say it directly. Bell Laboratories is prestigious, yes, but prestige does not heal grief. A year to breathe, to repair the house, to decide what comes next"”this is wise. You are thirty years old. You have time.*

Bell Laboratories.

The name landed with the weight of recognition. He had known people who worked there"”had applied, once, during his second doctorate, before deciding academia suited him better. Bell Labs was where theoretical physicists went when they wanted industry money without sacrificing research freedom. It was exactly where someone with his background might end up.

Someone had done their homework. Someone had built him a career that made sense, that fit his actual skills and interests, that a person with four PhDs in physics-adjacent fields might genuinely have pursued.

*Haruko wants me to tell you that you must eat properly. She does not trust you to cook for yourself. I have told her that you learned from Yuki, who learned from our mother, and that you will not starve. She is not convinced. Expect care packages.*

Despite everything"”despite the impossibility of his situation, despite the growing weight of a fabricated life settling onto his shoulders"”Sheldon almost smiled. The aunt who worried about food. The uncle who reassured her. The threat of care packages delivered with love and concern.

It sounded like family. It sounded *real*.

*When you are settled"”truly settled, not just arrived"”we will visit. Obon would be appropriate. Haruko wants to pay respects at the family grave, and I want to see what you do with the old place. Fumiko has also asked to come. She was too young to remember you well from your visit in 1980, but she has read Yuki's letters and feels she knows you. Her children ask about their American cousin. You have family here, Sheldon. Do not forget that.*

Obon. August. The festival of the dead, when families gathered and ancestors were honored.

Four months. He had four months before people who loved "Sheldon" arrived expecting to recognize him. Four months to learn a life he hadn't lived, to become a person he'd never been, to figure out how to look into the eyes of an elderly man and pretend he remembered being held as a child.

*I know you have had interest from NTT. You mentioned it in your December letter. They would be lucky to have you"”your work speaks for itself, and Japanese companies value loyalty and dedication. But do not rush. The patents you filed will keep. The ideas you have for your own company will keep. Rest first. Grieve properly. Your mother deserves that, and so do you.*

NTT. Patents. A tech company of his own. The constructed Sheldon had ambitions, had plans, had a future mapped out beyond the immediate crisis of arriving in a strange place with a strange life.

Someone had thought about this. Someone had built not just a past but a *future*"”a trajectory that would explain his presence, his activities, his goals for years to come.

*The enclosed letter is for the village. If anyone asks who you are or why you have come, show them this. It explains that you are Yuki's son, Kiyoshi's nephew, the rightful heir to the Tsukino property. In the countryside, family connections matter. This letter is your introduction.*

He looked at the second sheet. Shorter, more formal. A letter of introduction, complete with a red seal at the bottom"”Kiyoshi's personal *hanko*, his official stamp, lending the weight of his identity to the recommendation.

*To Whom It May Concern:*

*The bearer of this letter is Tsukino Sheldon, son of my late sister Tsukino Yuki and her husband James Carter of America...*

He skimmed the rest. The formal language, the careful phrasing, the request for kindness extended to a family member. It was exactly what he would need if he walked into a rural Japanese village as a Black American stranger"”proof of connection, of belonging, of having a right to be there.

Someone had thought of everything.

*Write when you arrive. Call if there is a telephone"”I do not know if Michiko-obasan had one installed. If not, the shrine has a phone. The priest there, Masaki-san, knew Michiko-obasan. He will help you if you need anything.*

Masaki.

The name snagged on something in his mind. The ruins uphill"”were they connected to a shrine? The priest, Masaki. A phone he could use. Help if he needed it.

*Travel safely. Eat properly. Rest.*

*Your uncle,*
*Kiyoshi*

*P.S. "” Haruko has already started planning what to cook when we visit. You have been warned.*

---

Sheldon sat in the chrysanthemums, holding the letters in hands that had begun to tremble.

This was too much. Too detailed. Too *caring*. Forged documents were one thing"”he could understand forged documents, could process them as tools, as props in whatever elaborate scenario he'd been dropped into. But this letter wasn't a tool. This letter was a man pouring love onto paper for a nephew he'd watched grow up, a nephew he'd worried about through years of grief and overwork, a nephew he was looking forward to seeing again.

The love was real. Kiyoshi's love was *real*, even if the memories that generated it had been manufactured from nothing.

*What kind of power does that?* he thought. *What kind of being creates not just documents but relationships? Not just a cover story but a family that genuinely cares?*

He thought of his grandmother. Of Dorothy Mae Carter, who had raised him after his parents proved unequal to the task, who had taught him everything that mattered about being a person in the world. She was gone now"”not dead in this timeline, but *gone*, existing in a universe he could no longer reach, loving a version of him that had died in a laboratory in Alaska.

But here was another family. A different family, manufactured by whatever force had rebuilt him and placed him here. An uncle who worried about him eating properly. An aunt planning meals for a visit. A cousin who wanted to meet him. Children who asked about their American cousin.

It wasn't the same. It could never be the same.

But it was something.

He folded the letters carefully, matching the original creases, and slid them back into the envelope. Then he tucked the envelope into the wallet, into the pocket designed to hold it, and put the wallet back where it belonged.

He had a cover story now. A complete one. If anyone asked why he was here, he could explain: the death of his mother, the inheritance from his aunt, the years of paperwork, the sabbatical from Bell Labs, the plan to rest and rebuild before deciding what came next. Every piece of it made sense. Every piece of it fit together into a life that someone could actually have lived.

The only problem was that he hadn't lived it.

And in four months, people who thought he had would arrive expecting him to remember.

---

The final document was a property deed, folded into thirds, formal Japanese covering every surface. It described a building and associated land in Okayama Prefecture, registered to Tsukino Sheldon, transferred from the previous owner"”Tsukino Michiko, deceased"”on a date that used an era-year format he had to calculate.

He had property. In Japan. In a prefecture he had never lived in, under a name that was his but wasn't his.

---

Something flickered at the edge of his awareness.

Not visual. Not auditory. More like a pressure behind his eyes, a sense of information trying to arrive through channels that weren't quite designed for it. Sheldon focused on the sensation instinctively, giving it his attention the way he would give attention to an anomalous reading on an instrument"”not forcing interpretation, just observing, letting the data resolve itself.

The pressure shifted, and knowledge arrived.

Not words, exactly. The information didn't come in sentences that he could hear or see. It simply became present in his mind, appearing with the quality of something remembered rather than something learned: *Physical form reconstructed. Life, family background, and documentation established.*

Sheldon stood very still.

The words"”if they could be called words"”landed differently now. He'd just read the proof of that establishment. The letters, the bankbooks, the photograph, the koseki. The life that had been built for him, complete with family who loved him and colleagues who respected him and a future that made sense.

*Life, family background, and documentation established.*

Yes. He'd noticed.

"Hello?" he said aloud. "Is someone there?"

No response. The presence"”if that's what it was"”had withdrawn, or perhaps it was simply waiting. He tried focusing on it again, trying to pull more information through whatever channel had briefly opened.

"What is this? Where am I? Who"”"

*Current location: Okayama Prefecture, Japan.*

The knowledge arrived mid-question, cutting him off with its matter-of-factness. Then, after a pause that might have been deliberate:

*Current date: April 3, 1989.*

Sheldon's legs stopped working.

He didn't fall"”his body simply refused the command to remain standing, folding beneath him with the graceless efficiency of a puppet whose strings had been cut. He sat down hard in the chrysanthemums, the impact jarring but not painful, and stared at nothing while his mind tried to process what he'd just learned.

1989.

He was in 1989.

The math ran itself, because the math always ran itself, because his mind couldn't encounter numbers without calculating their implications even when those implications were impossible.

1989. Thirty-six years before his death. A world where the Berlin Wall still stood, where the internet existed only in university basements, where the phone in his pocket would have been science fiction. A world that felt like history even though he'd lived through it once, as a child too young to remember.

But this wasn't his world. The realization settled into him with the weight of something too large to process all at once. Different universe. Different timeline. Whatever connection existed between here and the place he'd come from"”if any connection existed at all"”it wasn't the kind that would let him catch a flight to Georgia and knock on a familiar door.

His grandmother wasn't alive somewhere he couldn't reach. His grandmother was *gone*. The world where she had existed, where she had raised him, where she had taught him everything that mattered"”that world was as distant as the stars. Maybe more distant. At least you could see stars.

All he had left of her was what she'd given him. The lessons. The voice in his head. The stubborn insistence that a person could survive anything if they remembered how to breathe.

His hands were shaking.

He noticed the tremor distantly, the way he might notice a data point in an experiment"”with clinical interest that barely masked the chaos underneath. His palms pressed flat against his thighs, fingers digging into the fabric of his slacks, trying to ground himself through physical contact with something solid.

*When everything falls apart, baby, you breathe first.*

His grandmother's voice, rising unbidden from memory. The advice she'd given him when he was seven, crying over something he couldn't even remember now"”a broken toy, a failed test, some childhood catastrophe that had seemed world-ending at the time. She'd held him in her kitchen, her apron smelling of cornbread and her hands warm on his back, and she'd told him the secret to surviving anything.

*Breathe first. Everything else can wait until you've got air in your lungs.*

Sheldon breathed.

In through the nose, slow and controlled, the way she'd taught him. Hold for a count of four. Out through the mouth, slower still, letting the exhale carry tension out of his muscles. Again. And again. And again, until the shaking subsided and his heart stopped racing and he could think about something other than the impossibility of his current situation.

He was in 1989. In Japan. In a body that had been "reconstructed" by something that communicated in fragmentary impressions and refused to explain itself. He had documentation for a life he'd never lived, property in a place he'd never been, and a family background that someone"”something"”had apparently created for him.

*Life, family background, and documentation established.*

He'd seen the proof. The letters. The love.

He wasn't alone in this world.

The realization didn't make anything easier to understand, but it changed the shape of his panic. He wasn't a stranger dropped into hostile territory with nothing but forged papers. He was... what? An amnesiac returning home? A distant relative appearing to claim inheritance? Something. Someone. A person with a place in the world, even if he didn't know what that place was or how he'd come to occupy it.

---

He tried the voice again.

"Can you tell me more?" he asked the empty air, feeling foolish but not caring. "Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? Who arranged all of this?"

Silence. The presence"”if that's what it was"”had withdrawn, or gone dormant, or simply decided that it had provided enough information for now. He could feel it at the edge of his awareness, like a door that had closed but not locked, but his attempts to open it produced nothing.

The cosmic equivalent of software with no documentation. Source code with no comments. He was expected to figure out the interface on his own.

"Fine," he said, to himself or to the unhelpful presence or to no one at all. "Working hypothesis: isekai scenario."

The word surfaced automatically, drawing from years of consumed media"”anime and light novels and the particular subgenre of fiction where people died in their original world and woke up in new ones. Person dies. Person is transported. Person receives mysterious powers or helpful system interface or explanatory goddess who lays out the rules of their new existence. Adventures ensue.

He'd read enough of those stories to recognize the pattern he seemed to be living. But the pattern was incomplete. No status screen had appeared floating in his vision. No helpful voice was explaining the rules. No goddess had manifested to offer quests or assign objectives. There was only this: a field, a body, a handful of documents, and a presence that spoke in fragments and then fell silent.

"Status," he tried, focusing as hard as he could on the concept of a character sheet.

Nothing.

"Menu. Interface. System. Help."

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

Whatever had brought him here, whatever had reconstructed his body and established his life and placed him in this field of white chrysanthemums"”it wasn't offering a tutorial. It wasn't explaining the rules. It had given him the bare minimum necessary to exist in this world and then left him to figure out the rest.

He stood in the chrysanthemums, thinking.

---

The name on his documents was Tsukino. 月野. Moon-field.

The characters were common enough in Japanese. He'd encountered them before"”in his Kyoto years, in the manga he'd read to practice reading comprehension, in the cultural detritus that accumulated when you spent enough time engaging with Japanese media.

Tsukino.

The name snagged on something in his memory. A familiar association. A character he'd known since childhood, present in the cultural water supply the way certain stories and images just *were*, absorbed through osmosis whether you sought them out or not.

*Tsukino Usagi.*

His breath caught.

*Sailor Moon.*

He'd never been deep into magical girl anime"”had watched a few episodes here and there, enough to understand the references, enough to know the broad strokes of the genre. Sailor Moon was unavoidable. Blonde girl with the odango hair and the speeches about love and justice. Transformation sequences. Fighting evil by moonlight. One of the most famous anime in history, translated into dozens of languages, referenced in everything from academic papers to Saturday Night Live sketches.

The protagonist's name was Usagi Tsukino.

Someone had given him that surname.

Sheldon almost laughed. The sound came out strange"”half amusement, half something closer to hysteria. He was standing in a field in 1989, in a body that had been "reconstructed" by something that communicated in fragments, carrying documentation with a name from a cartoon.

*A cartoon about magical girls who drew power from celestial bodies. Who were protected by a queen named Serenity. Whose ultimate form, in the manga at least, was something called Sailor Cosmos"”*

He cut the thought off before it could complete itself.

That way lay madness. That way lay the kind of pattern-matching that conspiracy theorists and sleep-deprived researchers fell into when they'd been staring at data too long. A shared family name meant nothing. Japan had millions of people named Tsukino. The fact that he'd been given documentation with that particular name was coincidence, or someone's idea of a joke, or"”

Or it wasn't.

But he couldn't think about that. Not yet. Not without more data. He filed the observation away in the part of his mind that collected anomalies"”the part that had spent four doctoral programs learning to notice patterns without forcing conclusions"”and moved on.

---

*Baby, if you're going to think crazy thoughts, at least think them all the way through.*

His grandmother's voice, dry and practical.

Sheldon looked around. The field was empty. No one to see him make a fool of himself. No one to witness if he stood here and shouted anime attack names at the sky and nothing happened except the wind rustling through the chrysanthemums.

And if something *did* happen...

He closed his eyes. Reached for the memory of the warmth, that space between death and waking where something vast and kind had held him together. The wings. The chime-like resonance. The sense of being *seen* by something that operated on a scale he couldn't comprehend.

If he'd been given a name from that universe, if this wasn't coincidence but design, then maybe"”

He felt ridiculous. He felt like a child playing pretend in the backyard, wielding stick-swords against imaginary dragons. He felt like every otaku who'd ever secretly wished the fantasy were real.

He raised his hand anyway.

"Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss."

The words left his mouth with the cadence of something half-remembered, syllables arranged in the particular rhythm of attack names from a dozen magical girl series. He didn't expect anything to happen. He'd chosen the most absurd, over-the-top, patently ridiculous attack he could remember specifically *because* nothing would happen, and then he could move on with his day secure in the knowledge that at least he'd checked"”

Light erupted from his palm.

Not the controlled beam he half-remembered from the anime. Something rawer. Wilder. A cascade of golden-white radiance that tore through the air like a lightning strike, illuminating the field in colors that didn't have names, carrying with it a sensation of"”

*Warmth. The same warmth. The wings, the presence, the vast compassion that had gathered his shattered pieces and made them whole again"”*

The light cut off.

Sheldon's legs folded beneath him.

He hit the ground hard, shoulder first, rolling onto his back among the chrysanthemums while the sky spun lazily overhead. Every muscle in his body had gone slack, emptied of whatever force had been holding them together. His lungs worked in shallow gasps. His heart pounded with the desperate rhythm of a system pushed far beyond its limits.

---

He tried to move his hand. It twitched. That was all.

The white flowers swayed above him, indifferent to his condition, their petals catching the afternoon light with the same gentle beauty they'd displayed before he'd done something incredibly stupid. He lay among them like a corpse"”*like he'd been when he woke up*, the thought arrived with hysterical humor"”and stared at the sky while his body slowly, grudgingly, began to remember how to function.

That was real.

The thought circled through his oxygen-deprived brain, refusing to settle into any category that made sense. That was real. He had said words, ridiculous anime words, and light had come out of his hand, and now he was lying in a field unable to move because whatever energy that light had required, his body had possessed it and now did not.

He had magic. Or something like magic. Or access to something that behaved like magic when he spoke the right words in the right way.

He also, apparently, had approximately zero ability to control it.

Minutes passed. Five, maybe ten"”he'd lost track, his awareness narrowing to the basic project of convincing his lungs to keep working and his heart to keep beating. Gradually, feeling returned to his extremities. Gradually, his muscles began responding to commands again. Gradually, the exhaustion shifted from "complete system failure" to merely "worst hangover of his life."

He sat up. The motion took three tries and left him dizzy.

The field looked exactly the same. No scorch marks. No evidence that anything unusual had occurred. If someone had been watching from the road, they would have seen a man stand in a field, raise his hand, and then collapse"”strange behavior, certainly, but nothing that screamed *supernatural*.

Sheldon filed that observation away. Important. Whatever he could do, it didn't leave obvious traces. It could be hidden. It could be kept secret while he figured out what the hell he actually was and what rules governed this new existence.

Because he was going to keep it secret. That much was certain.

He didn't know what this world was"”isekai, parallel dimension, elaborate afterlife, something stranger still. He didn't know who or what had placed him here, or why they'd given him a name that resonated with magical girl mythology, or whether the power he'd just accidentally unleashed was a gift or a test or a cosmic joke at his expense.

What he knew was this: he was alone in unfamiliar territory, with no allies and no information and no understanding of the rules. The last thing he needed was to advertise capabilities he couldn't control to people whose motives he couldn't assess.

*When you don't know the game, baby, you keep your cards close until you figure out who's dealing.*

His grandmother again. Always his grandmother, even now.

Sheldon got to his feet. The motion was no longer effortless"”his body felt like it had been wrung out and hung up to dry"”but he managed it. He swayed once, caught himself, and took stock of his condition.

Exhausted. Shaky. Functional, barely.

He could still walk. He could still reach the road, find people, ask questions. He would just do it more slowly than he'd planned, and he would keep the reason for his fatigue to himself.

He brushed dirt and grass from his slacks, straightened his shirt, and looked around with the systematic attention of a scientist surveying a new experiment.

The field stretched around him in a gentle slope, chrysanthemums and grass giving way to rice paddies below and forested hills above. The stone ruins were visible uphill, weathered and overgrown but somehow significant"”he couldn't shake the feeling that this place *meant* something, that he'd been placed here rather than arriving randomly.

A road was visible in the distance, maybe five hundred meters downslope"”a thin gray line cutting between agricultural fields, promising connection to the wider world. He would walk to it. He would find people. He would ask questions, carefully, presenting himself as a man with a cover story he'd just read in detail"”the grieving son, the returning heir, the physicist on sabbatical. He would figure out what the Tsukino property looked like, meet the priest named Masaki, perhaps hire the roofer named Yamamoto.

He would breathe, and he would move, and he would take things one step at a time until he understood enough to take bigger steps.

*Live well.*

The impression surfaced in his memory"”not the presence speaking now, but the echo of what it had said in that space between death and rebirth. Live well. Whatever had saved him, whatever had reconstructed his body and placed him here with a life and a family and a chance at something new"”that's what it had asked of him.

He didn't know if he could trust that request. Didn't know if the presence was benevolent or manipulative or something beyond either category. But he knew what his grandmother would say about being given a second chance: *Don't waste it, baby. Don't you dare waste it.*

Sheldon took one last look at the chrysanthemums, at the castle ruins, at the field where he had been born into this new existence"”and where he had learned, in the space of a few reckless seconds, that this new existence came with capabilities he did not understand and could not yet control.

Then he turned toward the road and started walking, slower than he would have liked, leaving the white flowers to keep whatever secrets they had been planted to guard.

Behind him, in the circle where he had stood and spoken words that shouldn't have meant anything, the chrysanthemums held their faces toward the afternoon sun. Their petals had taken on a luminosity that hadn't been there an hour ago"”whites more vivid, yellows at their centers deeper and richer, the plants themselves standing fractionally taller than their neighbors at the field's edges. The difference was subtle. Someone would have to know what to look for, would have to have seen the field before and after, would have to understand that living things sometimes responded to energies that physics textbooks didn't acknowledge.

Sheldon, eyes fixed on the road ahead and mind cataloging more immediate concerns, did not look back.

### Scene 1.2: The Road
**15:20 — Path through rice paddies**


The path between the paddies was barely wide enough for his shoulders.

Sheldon picked his way along the raised earthen ridge that separated one flooded field from the next, his feet finding purchase on ground that generations of farmers had packed solid through daily use. The rice hadn't been planted yet—too early in the season, he realized, the water in the paddies serving some preparatory purpose he didn't fully understand—but the infrastructure was ancient and well-maintained, a network of narrow walkways threading between rectangular pools that caught the afternoon sky like scattered mirrors.

His legs worked. That was the important thing. Whatever reservoir of energy he'd drained with his experiment in the field, the deficit was no longer catastrophic. He could walk, could balance on the uneven path, could put one foot in front of the other without his knees buckling. The exhaustion had settled into something manageable—a heaviness in his limbs, a faint tremor in his hands when he held them still, the particular bone-deep fatigue of a body that had been asked to do something it wasn't prepared for.

He'd felt similar after his first marathon. After the three-day coding sprint that had produced his doctoral thesis simulations. After the night his grandmother died and he'd sat with her body until the funeral home came, unable to sleep, unable to look away, needing to be present for every moment of her absence.

The body knew how to be tired. The body knew how to keep moving anyway.

The paddies stretched around him in irregular patterns, following contours of terrain that predated any concept of efficient land use. Some were large enough to plant a small field of corn; others barely bigger than a parking space, tucked into corners where the slope allowed a few extra square meters of cultivation. The water in each was perfectly still, undisturbed by wind, reflecting clouds and sky with a clarity that made him feel like he was walking between two versions of the same world.

Mountains rose in the distance—not the dramatic peaks of postcard Japan, but older shapes, worn smooth by millennia of weather, covered in forest that looked like it had never been cut. The treeline came down almost to the paddies' edge in places, dark green against the pale spring sky. Birds called from somewhere in that green darkness, sounds he didn't recognize, species that probably didn't exist in Alaska or Georgia or any of the other places he'd lived.

He was really here.

The thought kept arriving, unwelcome and undeniable. Not dreaming. Not hallucinating in the final moments of consciousness as the cascade failure unmade him. Really, physically, materially present in a body that walked and breathed and cast a shadow on the path ahead of him. The evidence accumulated with each step: mud on his shoes, sun warming the back of his neck, the specific ache of muscles recovering from unprecedented strain.

A farmer was visible in one of the distant paddies, bent over some task Sheldon couldn't identify from this distance. The figure was too far away for details—just a shape in work clothes, maybe wearing a conical hat, engaged in labor that had probably looked identical five hundred years ago. The farmer didn't look up as Sheldon passed. Probably hadn't even noticed him, absorbed in whatever agricultural rhythm governed days out here.

The path curved around a larger paddy, following the terrain, and Sheldon's perspective shifted enough to see more of the landscape ahead. The road was closer now—he could make out individual trees along its edge, a wooden utility pole carrying wires toward some unseen destination, the gray-brown surface of packed earth or old asphalt. Another ten minutes of walking, maybe fifteen at his current pace.

His mind kept circling back to the light.

He hadn't imagined it. The soreness in his muscles, the depleted feeling that still dragged at his limbs—those were real, physical consequences of a real, physical event. He had raised his hand and spoken words and something had responded. Energy had moved through him, or out of him, or from somewhere else entirely using him as a conduit. The mechanism didn't matter yet. What mattered was the fact: he had access to something that shouldn't exist.

The name Tsukino. The attack phrase from a children's anime. The warmth he remembered from the space between death and waking. These weren't coincidences. They were data points, pieces of a pattern he couldn't yet see, clues left by whoever or whatever had reconstructed his existence and placed him in this field in this country in this decade.

But he had more than clues now. He had the letter.

Uncle Kiyoshi's words unfolded in his memory, each detail a thread he could pull on, a foundation he could build from. Bell Laboratories. His mother Yuki, gone four years now. The house in Kamogata that had waited for him while he settled her affairs, rented out the Oakland property, arranged for a year away from work. The Yamamoto family watching over the empty building. Fumiko wanting to meet him. August and Obon and the promise of family arriving to check on his progress.

Someone—something—had given him not just documentation but a *story*. A life with texture and depth, with relationships that extended backward in time and forward into obligations he would have to navigate. He wasn't a blank slate dropped into Japan with nothing but forged papers. He was Tsukino Sheldon, returning to claim an inheritance, grieving a mother, taking time to rebuild. The cover story wasn't a cover story at all. It was simply... true. As true as anything could be when reality itself had been rewritten to accommodate his existence.

*Life, family background, and documentation established.*

The presence hadn't lied. It had given him exactly what it promised, in exhaustive detail, down to the worn edges of photographs and the particular creases in letters that suggested years of handling. The question wasn't whether the infrastructure would hold—it would. The question was what he was supposed to do with it.

His grandmother would have had opinions about that.

*Nobody's coming to save you, baby. That's not pessimism—that's just facts. You want something done, you do it yourself. You want help, you earn it by being worth helping.*

The memory surfaced with the particular clarity of oft-repeated wisdom, her voice sharp and warm at the same time, the way she'd sounded when she was teaching him something she considered essential. She'd never had patience for waiting, for passivity, for the assumption that the universe owed anyone anything. You worked. You prepared. You made yourself capable of handling whatever came, and then when it came, you handled it.

The presence that had saved him—whatever it was, wherever it had gone—had given him the tools. The rest was up to him.

Sheldon kept walking.

The paddies began to give way to other forms of agriculture as he approached the road. Vegetable gardens, maybe, or the early stages of orchards—he could see rows of small trees, their branches still bare or just beginning to bud, arranged with the geometric precision that suggested human cultivation rather than natural growth. A shed appeared at the edge of one field, its wooden walls weathered to silver-gray, farming implements visible through the open door. Everything looked functional and well-used, maintained by hands that understood the value of tools.

The road, when he finally reached it, was narrower than he'd expected.

Two lanes, barely. Asphalt that had seen better decades, its surface cracked and patched in patterns that told a story of limited municipal budgets and harsh winters. No sidewalk—the road simply ended at its edges, giving way to drainage ditches and then the agricultural land beyond. A utility pole stood nearby, wires humming faintly with electricity, connecting this rural nowhere to a grid that probably hadn't changed much since the 1960s.

He stood at the road's edge and looked both directions.

To his left, the road curved around a forested hill and disappeared. To his right, it ran relatively straight for several hundred meters before dipping into what might be a small valley, buildings barely visible in the distance—a cluster of structures that could be a village. Kamogata. The letter had mentioned the name, the village where the family house waited, where the Yamamoto family had been keeping watch. Those distant buildings might be his destination, or might be somewhere else entirely. Without a map, without landmarks he recognized from a life he hadn't actually lived, he had no way to orient himself except by asking someone who knew the area.

The logical approach was exactly that. Ask someone.

He was in rural Japan in 1989. Before smartphones, before GPS, before the assumption that any question could be answered by consulting a device in your pocket. People here navigated by asking other people, by knowing their neighbors, by maintaining the kind of social infrastructure that cities had largely abandoned. If he wanted to find the address on his documentation, he would have to talk to someone who knew the area.

The thought was less daunting than it should have been.

He'd lived in Japan before—years in Kyoto, working on projects that required daily interaction with colleagues and shopkeepers and the various functionaries of academic life. His Japanese was fluent, had been even before whatever process had reconstructed him, and he'd always been comfortable navigating cultural expectations that confused other foreigners. The language wouldn't be a barrier.

And he had a story now—a real one, or real enough. A physicist from America, taking sabbatical after years of demanding work, coming to claim the house his great-aunt had left him. Just arrived, still getting his bearings, needing directions to the village his family had come from. The letter had given him everything he needed: names, context, the shape of a life he could step into. All he had to do was present himself as who the documents said he was.

That part, at least, wasn't a lie. He *was* Tsukino Sheldon, whatever that meant. The name was on his registration card, his bankbooks, his property deed. The family existed—Uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka, cousin Fumiko with her children, the web of relations documented in the koseki. Whether those relationships had been built over decades or conjured into being by something that spoke in chimes and starlight, they were real now. Real enough to build on.

A sound reached him from his right—mechanical, rhythmic, approaching. An engine of some kind, not the high whine of a motorcycle but the deeper rumble of something larger. A truck, maybe, or an old car. Coming from the direction of the village.

Sheldon stepped back from the road's edge, positioning himself clearly on the verge where he'd be visible to any approaching driver. His exhaustion was still present but manageable, and he'd recovered enough to stand without swaying, to present himself as someone who needed assistance rather than someone who needed rescue.

The vehicle came around a bend in the road and resolved into shape: a small truck, white and rust-spotted, the kind of practical working vehicle that farmers the world over seemed to favor. It was moving slowly, in no particular hurry, the driver presumably familiar enough with this road to know there was rarely reason to rush.

The letter had mentioned a family watching the house. *Yamamoto*, his uncle had written. Sheldon wondered if this might be one of them—if the infrastructure of care his benefactor had built extended even to chance encounters on rural roads. Or maybe it was just a farmer heading home, unconnected to anything, willing to help a stranger because that's what people did out here.

Either way, he needed directions. Either way, he was about to have his first real conversation in this new life.

Sheldon raised his hand. Not a wave, exactly—more of an acknowledgment, a signal that he was present and would appreciate attention. The gesture felt natural, the universal language of someone who needed help and was willing to ask for it politely.

The truck began to slow.

---


### Scene 1.3: The Yamamoto Encounter
**15:50 — Roadside pickup**


The truck rolled to a stop ten meters ahead of where Sheldon stood, tires crunching on loose gravel at the road's edge. Through the windshield he could see the driver leaning forward, peering at him with the particular expression of someone trying to make sense of something unexpected.

Sheldon understood that expression. He was, after all, a Black man standing alone on a rural Japanese road in 1989.

The calculation was automatic, running in the background of his mind the way such calculations always did when he was somewhere new, somewhere unfamiliar with people who looked like him. Not fear—he'd stopped feeling fear about this years ago, had learned to treat it as data rather than threat. Just awareness. Recognition of the social mathematics that governed how he would be perceived before he opened his mouth, before anyone knew anything about him except the color of his skin.

Rural Japan in the late 1980s had perhaps a few thousand Black residents in the entire country. Maybe fewer. The American military bases concentrated most of them in Okinawa and a handful of other locations; the rest were scattered—businesspeople, academics, the occasional tourist who'd wandered far from the typical routes. Out here, in agricultural Okayama, the driver of this truck might never have seen a Black person in his life except on television.

Sheldon kept his posture open, unthreatening, and waited.

The driver's door opened. A man climbed out—short, wiry, weathered in the way farmers were weathered everywhere in the world, his skin darkened by decades of sun and his hands thick-knuckled from decades of labor. He wore khaki work pants and a dark blue cotton shirt, a cap with what looked like an agricultural cooperative logo pushed back on his head. Sixty, maybe sixty-five. Old enough to have memories of the war, of Americans as occupiers before they became allies.

The man walked toward Sheldon with the unhurried gait of someone who had never had reason to rush anywhere. His eyes stayed on Sheldon's face—not hostile, not fearful, just assessing. Taking the measure of something new.

"Daijoubu desu ka?" The question came out in a low, unhurried voice, the vowels shaped by what Sheldon recognized as rural Okayama dialect. *Are you okay?*

Not *what are you doing here* or *who are you* or any of the dozen defensive openings the situation might have prompted. Just concern. A stranger on a road, looking tired and somewhat disheveled, clearly in need of something. The instinct to help before the instinct to question.

Sheldon felt something loosen in his chest.

"Hai, daijoubu desu." He kept his own Japanese neutral, polite, the standard Tokyo-inflected speech he'd learned in Kyoto rather than any regional variation. "Sumimasen, chotto michi ni mayotte shimatte..." *I'm fine. Excuse me, I seem to have gotten a bit lost...*

The farmer's eyebrows rose. Not dramatically—just a small shift, the kind of micro-expression that people made when reality diverged from expectation. A Black man on a rural road was unusual. A Black man on a rural road who spoke Japanese with the fluency of someone who had lived in the country for years was something else entirely.

"Your Japanese is good." The farmer said it as simple observation, not compliment. A fact being noted.

"I lived in Kyoto for some time. For work." Sheldon gestured vaguely, the kind of motion that suggested a longer story he wasn't going to tell in full. "But I'm not familiar with this area. I'm looking for Kamogata—the village?"

Something shifted in the farmer's expression. "Kamogata. That's where I'm headed." He tilted his head, studying Sheldon with renewed interest. "You have business there?"

This was the moment. The first test of the story he'd been given.

"Family business," Sheldon said. "My great-aunt passed away some years ago—Tsukino Michiko. She left property that I'm finally coming to claim."

The name landed like a stone in still water.

"Tsukino." The farmer repeated it slowly, something changing behind his eyes. "You're the Tsukino nephew? From America?"

*Yamamoto*, Sheldon's mind supplied, the connection snapping into place. *The letter. The family watching the house.*

"My name is Tsukino Sheldon," he said, allowing a small bow—not deep, but respectful. "My mother was Tsukino Yuki. She grew up here, before she emigrated."

The farmer's face transformed. The cautious assessment gave way to something warmer, something that looked almost like recognition even though they had never met. He pulled off his cap and ran a hand through thinning gray hair, shaking his head slowly.

"Yuki-chan," he said, and the diminutive carried decades of memory. "I knew her. When we were young—before the war, she was..." He stopped, collected himself, put the cap back on. "I'm Yamamoto Takeshi. Your uncle wrote to me. Said you might be coming."

Yamamoto.

The infrastructure of care, made visible. Uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka, writing letters to coordinate Sheldon's arrival. The Yamamoto family here, watching the house, waiting for the nephew who might someday appear to claim it. A network of obligation and assistance that Sheldon had not built, had not earned, but that existed nonetheless—real and functional and already working on his behalf.

"My uncle mentioned your family," Sheldon said. "He said you'd been keeping an eye on the property. I'm grateful."

Takeshi waved the gratitude away with a rough hand. "The house needed watching. Your aunt Michiko was a good neighbor for forty years. What else would we do?" He looked Sheldon up and down again, but differently now—not assessing a stranger but evaluating a known quantity, someone who had shifted from *unexpected foreigner* to *Yuki-chan's son* in the space of a few sentences. "You look tired. Have you walked far?"

"From the field up the hill. Near the old castle ruins."

"That's a walk." Takeshi turned back toward his truck, gesturing for Sheldon to follow. "Come. I'll take you to the village. We can talk on the way."

---

The truck's cab smelled of fertilizer and tobacco, the particular combination of agriculture and habit that Sheldon associated with his grandfather's friends back in Georgia. The seat was worn vinyl, tan and cracked in places, molded by years of use into a shape that suggested someone about Takeshi's size. A small charm hung from the rearview mirror—an omamori, the kind sold at shrines for traffic safety, its fabric faded but the embroidered characters still legible.

"Masaki Shrine," Takeshi said, noticing Sheldon's glance. "Up the mountain, past where you'll be staying. Good shrine. Old priest there, Masaki Katsuhito—knew your grandmother Hana, back in the day."

Sheldon filed the information away. A shrine nearby. A priest named Masaki. More threads in the web he was only beginning to perceive.

"The house," he said as the truck pulled back onto the road, engine rattling with the comfortable complaint of machinery that had done its job for years. "My uncle's letter mentioned it needed some work. The roof?"

Takeshi made a sound that was half grunt, half laugh. "The roof needs more than work. Needs replacing, most of it. Michiko-san couldn't keep up with repairs the last few years—her health, you understand. We patched what we could, but..." He shrugged, the motion eloquent. "You'll see. It's not falling down. Just needs attention."

"I expected as much." Sheldon watched the landscape slide past—paddies giving way to orchards, orchards to the first scattered buildings of what must be the village's outskirts. "I'm planning to take the time to do it properly. I'm on sabbatical from work. A year to get things sorted."

"Sabbatical." Takeshi pronounced the English word carefully, uncertain of its shape. "Like a vacation?"

"More like... permitted time away. To rest. To think about what comes next." Sheldon paused, considering how much to share, then decided that more truth was better than less. "My mother passed away four years ago. It took time to settle her affairs, to arrange things so I could come here. This is the first chance I've had to actually see the place she grew up."

The truck slowed as they approached a curve, Takeshi's hands steady on the wheel. "Yuki-chan," he said again, quietly. "She was a few years younger than me. Pretty girl. Laughed a lot, I remember. When she left for America..." He trailed off, the unfinished sentence carrying its own weight. When she left, she left for good. She never came back, except in letters and photographs and the son who now sat in his truck.

"She talked about this place," Sheldon said. It wasn't true—he had no memories of his mother talking about anything, because his mother was a construction, a story written into reality by something he didn't understand—but it felt like the kind of thing that should be true. The kind of thing a real son would say. "She missed it, I think. Even though she made her life in America."

"Home stays with you." Takeshi nodded, as if this confirmed something he'd always believed. "No matter how far you go."

---

The village emerged from the landscape gradually, not announced by any sign or boundary but simply accumulating—more buildings, closer together; a proper road surface instead of patched asphalt; telephone poles with more wires connecting to more destinations. They passed a small shop with vegetables displayed outside, an old woman sweeping the step who looked up as the truck went by. Passed a cluster of houses with tile roofs in various states of repair. Passed what might have been a school, though Sheldon only caught a glimpse of playground equipment before it disappeared behind them.

"The main road goes through to Fukuyama eventually," Takeshi said, gesturing ahead. "But your house—the Tsukino house—it's off to the north. I'll take you as far as the turn, but after that..." He hesitated, something uncomfortable entering his expression. "The road gets rough. My truck can make it, but it's easier if you walk the last part. Maybe three hundred meters."

"That's fine." Sheldon's legs had recovered enough during the drive; he could manage three hundred meters. "I appreciate the ride this far."

"You'll need supplies," Takeshi said, the practical concern of someone who had spent a lifetime thinking about such things. "The house has been empty—no food, maybe no water if the pipes have problems. There's a store near the shrine path, Haruna-san's place. She keeps late hours. Tell her Yamamoto sent you, she'll help you get started."

Haruna-san. Another name for the growing list. Another thread in the web.

"The shrine you mentioned," Sheldon said. "Masaki Shrine. Is that far from the house?"

"Just up the hill. Three hundred steps to the top, maybe more—I stopped counting years ago." Takeshi chuckled, a warm sound. "The old priest comes down to the village sometimes. Good man. Quiet. His grandson lives with him—little boy, maybe four or five now. Lost his mother last year." The chuckle faded into something more somber. "Sad business, that. The boy's father works in the city, can't take care of him alone. So Masaki-san raises him."

A priest with a grandson. A little boy who'd lost his mother. The details accumulated, painting a picture of a community with its own histories, its own griefs, its own interconnected lives that Sheldon was about to become part of.

The truck slowed again, pulling to the side of the road near a narrow path that branched off between two weathered stone walls. "This is the turn," Takeshi said. "Follow the path, bear left at the fork, you'll see the house. Can't miss it—it's the one that looks like it's been waiting."

Sheldon reached for the door handle, then paused. "Yamamoto-san. Thank you. For the ride, and for... everything your family has done. Watching the house. I know it wasn't required."

Takeshi waved the thanks away again, but his eyes were kind. "Your grandmother Hana helped my mother when times were hard. We remember such things." He reached across the cab and gripped Sheldon's shoulder briefly—a firm pressure, warm and surprisingly strong. "Welcome home, Tsukino-san. Come find me if you need anything. My farm is the one with the persimmon orchard, east side of the village. Anyone can show you."

Sheldon climbed out of the truck, his feet finding solid ground, his body still tired but his mind more settled than it had been since waking in the chrysanthemum field. He had a direction now. A place to go, people who expected him, a story that had already begun to tell itself through the connections his benefactor had woven into being.

"Thank you," he said again, and closed the door.

The truck pulled away, rattling back toward wherever Yamamoto Takeshi kept his persimmons and his memories of a girl named Yuki who had laughed a lot before she left for America. Sheldon watched until it disappeared around a curve, then turned to face the narrow path between the stone walls.

Three hundred meters to a house that had been waiting.

He started walking.

---


### Scene 1.4: The Tsukino House
**16:20 — First sight of inheritance**


The path between the stone walls was barely wider than his shoulders, packed earth giving way to irregular stepping stones as it wound upward through a tunnel of overgrown bamboo. Late afternoon light filtered through the green canopy in shifting patterns, and somewhere ahead Sheldon could hear water moving—a stream, maybe, or runoff from the mountain above.

Three hundred meters, Yamamoto had said. It felt longer.

His body was running on something other than physical reserves now. The exhaustion from the field had settled into a background hum, present but no longer urgent, displaced by the sharper focus of someone approaching something significant. Each step brought him closer to a house he had never seen, in a village he had never lived in, carrying documents that claimed both as his birthright.

The bamboo thinned. The path curved left around a moss-covered boulder, and then—

The house.

It sat in a clearing that must once have been carefully maintained, a traditional wooden structure with dark walls and a tile roof that caught the golden afternoon light. Single story, as traditional farmhouses were, with an engawa wrapping around two visible sides—a covered veranda whose boards had weathered to silver-gray. The roof tiles were intact in some places, missing or cracked in others, the damage visible even from twenty meters away. Weeds grew tall around the foundation, and what had once been a garden was now a controlled riot of green, shapes barely distinguishable beneath years of neglect.

But the walls were straight. The windows were intact. The structure itself looked sound, waiting beneath its accumulation of weather and time like something patient, something that had known he was coming.

*The Kamogata house has been waiting for you.*

Uncle Kiyoshi's words, but they felt different now. Less metaphor, more literal truth. The house had been waiting. For years, maybe decades, through owners who aged and died and left it to the uncertain custody of neighbors and distant family. And now he was here, and whatever happened next would happen because he chose to make it happen.

Sheldon walked the remaining distance slowly, letting his eyes catalog details the way his mind always cataloged data. The genkan—the entryway—was recessed beneath the roof overhang, its step worn smooth by generations of feet. A wooden nameplate hung beside the door, the characters faded but still legible: 月野. Tsukino. His name, apparently. His family's name, certainly, according to every document in his wallet.

The door was unlocked.

He wasn't sure if this surprised him. Rural Japan in 1989, a house watched by neighbors, a community where everyone knew everyone—locks were probably more formality than necessity out here. He slid the door open and stepped into the genkan, pausing to let his eyes adjust to the dimmer interior light.

The smell hit him first. Not decay—nothing had rotted here, nothing had died—but the particular mustiness of enclosed space and settled dust, of air that hadn't moved in months or years. Underneath it, fainter, the ghost of wood smoke and something floral, old incense maybe, the accumulated aromatics of a house that had been lived in for generations before it was abandoned.

Sheldon removed his shoes and stepped up onto the raised floor, the wood creaking softly beneath his weight. The hallway ahead was narrow and dark, doors opening on either side into rooms he couldn't yet see. Dust motes swirled in the light from behind him, disturbed by his passage, dancing in patterns that looked almost deliberate.

"Hello?" His voice sounded strange in the silence—too loud, too present, an intrusion into space that had grown accustomed to emptiness. No answer came. He hadn't expected one.

---

The main room was eight tatami mats, the woven surface faded and dusty but intact. Afternoon light filtered through paper screens that had yellowed with age, casting everything in sepia tones. Furniture remained—a low table in the center, cushions stacked against one wall, a cabinet with sliding doors that probably held dishes or household items. Everything was covered in a fine layer of dust, undisturbed except where Sheldon's feet had tracked through it.

Against the far wall, in the place of honor, stood a butsudan.

The family altar was small but well-made, its dark wood carved with simple patterns, its doors standing open to reveal the interior shrine. Photographs sat on the lower shelf—faces Sheldon didn't recognize, people who had lived and died in this house, whose names were probably recorded in the koseki excerpt in his wallet. His family, according to the documents. Strangers, according to his memory.

He stood before the altar for a long moment, not praying—he didn't know how, didn't know what words would be appropriate even if he wanted to speak them—but acknowledging. These people had existed. They had built this house, raised children in it, grown old and passed on and left it to whoever came after. And now he was here, the latest link in a chain he hadn't forged, inheriting a legacy he hadn't earned.

*Live well.*

The presence's words. The only instruction he'd been given. Whatever else this was—gift, obligation, cosmic accident—he was supposed to make something of it. To live, and to live well, in a life that had been constructed for him by something he didn't understand.

The butsudan waited, patient as the house itself. Sheldon bowed—shallow, awkward, the gesture of someone who knew the form but not the feeling—and moved on.

---

The bedroom was six tatami, smaller than the main room but still larger than most apartments he'd lived in during his Kyoto years. An oshiire closet took up one wall, its sliding doors closed. He opened them and found what he expected: futons, quilts, pillows, all folded and stored with the care of someone who intended to use them again. Dusty, yes. Musty from years in enclosed space. But present, and probably functional after airing out.

He had a place to sleep. That was something.

The second room was smaller still—four and a half tatami, barely enough for a desk and storage. It might have been a study once, or a room for a child. Empty now except for a small bookshelf, its contents too faded to read from the doorway. He would explore it later, when he had light and time and energy.

The kitchen was the last room on the ground floor, separated from the living areas by a narrow hallway that suggested it had been added later, expanding the original structure. A gas stove sat against one wall, its surface grimy with old cooking residue. A sink with a hand pump—old-fashioned, the kind that drew from a well or natural source rather than municipal water. Cabinets that probably held dishes and cookware, counters that would need scrubbing before they could be used.

On impulse, Sheldon tried the pump.

The handle was stiff from disuse, resisting his first pull. He worked it again, putting his weight into the motion, and felt something give—air in the pipes, maybe, or sediment being cleared. On the fourth pump, water coughed from the spout. Brown at first, rusty with age, but clearing quickly to something that looked almost drinkable. By the eighth pump it ran clear, cold, with the mineral taste of groundwater.

He had water. The pump drew from a natural source—a stream, probably, or an underground spring fed by the mountain above. Whatever arrangements had been made generations ago still held. The infrastructure was older than municipal utilities, and it still worked.

*The kitchen stove may need repair*, Uncle Kiyoshi had written. *She also says you should buy a good futon immediately.*

The futons in the closet might serve for tonight, if he could air them out. The stove would need gas connected, which meant paperwork and waiting. But he had water—clean, cold water that didn't depend on anyone reconnecting anything. One problem solved before he'd known it was solvable.

---

The engawa creaked under his weight as he stepped outside through the sliding doors in the main room. The veranda ran along the south and west sides of the house, its boards weathered but solid—mostly. He could see where some had darkened with rot, spots that would need replacing before they gave way entirely. More items for the list that was growing in his mind.

The garden spread before him, wild and overgrown, beautiful in its chaos.

What had once been a vegetable plot was now a sea of weeds, green shoots pushing through the remains of whatever had been planted last. A maple tree dominated one corner, its branches creating a canopy over a stone bench that was barely visible beneath moss and fallen leaves. Stone paths wound through the growth, their edges marked by rocks that had shifted and settled over years of neglect. And in the far corner, its trunk gnarled with age, a persimmon tree stood like a sentinel—still alive, if the buds on its branches were any indication. Still capable of bearing fruit, if someone cared for it.

A pond occupied the center of the garden, its surface choked with algae, its edges lost beneath encroaching greenery. But water glinted beneath the green—the pond was holding, still functioning as whatever it had been designed to do. Another thing that could be recovered with work.

Beyond the garden's eastern edge, through a gap in the overgrown hedge, Sheldon caught a glimpse of something larger. Water, reflecting the afternoon sky. A lake, perhaps two hundred meters away through the trees, its surface calm and mirror-bright.

He hadn't expected that. The property bordered a lake—or at least had a view of one. The stream that fed his kitchen pump probably flowed from there, carrying mountain water down through the forest to wherever it eventually joined a river. He could hear it now that he was listening: the faint sound of moving water somewhere to his left, the quiet heartbeat of the infrastructure that made this place livable.

The lake looked peaceful. Ancient. The kind of place that had been here long before the house was built, long before anyone had claimed the land around it. Whatever shrine Yamamoto had mentioned—Masaki Shrine, up the mountain—probably drew its own water from the same source. Neighbors sharing resources, the way neighbors had done for generations.

*The bones of something lovely*, Sheldon thought. That was how his grandmother would have described it. Not ruined, just waiting. Waiting for someone to see what it could become and be willing to do the work to get there.

He turned back to face the house, seeing it now from the garden's perspective. The dark wood walls, the damaged roof, the paper screens that filtered light into rooms that had been empty for years. A house that had belonged to a family named Tsukino, passed down through generations until it reached him—a man who had died in a laboratory accident in a world that no longer existed, reconstructed by something beyond his comprehension and placed here with documents that made him the legal heir to everything he saw.

It wasn't fair. None of it was fair—not his death, not his resurrection, not the fact that he was standing in a garden in rural Japan in 1989 when he should have been scattered atoms in the ruins of a containment failure. But fair had never been the relevant metric. His grandmother had taught him that. *Fair is what you make it, baby. The world gives you what it gives you. What you do with it—that's the part that's up to you.*

The sun was lower now, the light shifting from gold toward amber. Maybe two hours until dark, maybe less. He needed supplies—food, water, some way to make the house functional for at least one night. Yamamoto had mentioned a store near the shrine path, run by someone named Haruna. *Tell her Yamamoto sent you*, he'd said. *She'll help you get started.*

Sheldon took one more look at the garden, at the house, at the life that was somehow now his. Then he turned and walked back through the main room, past the butsudan with its photographs of strangers, through the dusty hallway to the genkan where his shoes waited.

He had work to do.

---


### Scene 1.5: Haruna's Store
**17:00 — Supplies and information**


The path from the Tsukino house curved back toward the main road, but a smaller trail branched off to the left before reaching it—a packed-earth track that wound through trees toward what looked like a cluster of buildings. Sheldon followed it, trusting Yamamoto's directions. *Near the shrine path*, he'd said. *Run by Haruna-san.*

The trees thinned after a hundred meters, opening onto a small clearing where three buildings sat in comfortable proximity. A house with a vegetable garden. A storage shed with agricultural equipment visible through the open doors. And between them, facing the path with a faded awning and hand-painted signs, a shop.

Not a shop in any urban sense—no glass storefront, no illuminated signage, no carefully arranged displays. This was a converted section of someone's home, the front room opened up and filled with shelves, a sliding door standing open to catch the afternoon breeze. The sign above read 春菜商店—Haruna Shōten—in characters that had been repainted enough times to show their history.

A small bell chimed as Sheldon stepped onto the raised wooden floor of the entrance. The shop smelled of wood and incense and something floral—dried flowers, maybe, or soap. Shelves lined every wall, packed with the kind of inventory that accumulated over decades: canned goods, rice crackers, cleaning supplies, batteries, incense, candles, soap, towels, stationery, and dozens of items he couldn't immediately identify. A glass case near the back held what looked like local confections, and a small refrigerator hummed quietly beside it.

"Irasshaimase!"

The voice came from somewhere behind a curtain at the back, followed by the sound of movement. A moment later, a woman emerged—small, slightly stooped with age, white hair pulled back in a practical bun, wearing a faded blue apron over a simple housedress. Her face was a map of smile lines, the kind that came from decades of genuine warmth rather than polite performance.

She stopped when she saw him.

The pause lasted perhaps two seconds—long enough for her eyes to take in everything, short enough that someone less observant might have missed it entirely. Then the smile returned, wider than before, and she was moving toward the counter with a speed that belied her apparent age.

"Ah! You must be him. Yamamoto's wife called an hour ago—said there was a young man walking up from the paddies, heading toward the Tsukino place. Said you were tall and polite and spoke Japanese like you'd lived here." She reached the counter and rested her hands on it, studying him with frank curiosity. "She didn't mention how handsome you were, but Setsuko always did leave out the interesting details."

Sheldon felt something shift in his assessment of the situation. The village information network—Yamamoto had warned him about the gossip, but this was something else entirely. Faster than any telephone. He was beginning to understand what that meant.

"Yamamoto-san gave me directions," he said. "He mentioned you might be able to help me get started."

"Takeshi-kun? Of course he did. Good boy, that one—well, he's sixty-four now, so perhaps 'boy' isn't quite right anymore, but I've known him since he was stealing persimmons from my trees, so." She waved a hand as if brushing away the decades. "What do you need? And don't say 'everything'—I've heard that before, and it never ends well for anyone's wallet."

---

What Sheldon needed, it turned out, was more than he'd initially calculated but less than he'd feared.

Haruna moved through her shop with the efficiency of someone who knew exactly where everything was and exactly what a person in his situation would require. She asked questions as she gathered items—practical questions, the kind that revealed information while appearing to simply solve problems.

"The house has been empty how long? Four years? Five? The Yamamoto boy checked on it last autumn, said the roof was holding but the garden had gone wild." She pulled candles from a shelf—thick ones, the kind that would burn for hours. "You'll want these. Power might be connected, might not. Takes the electric company a week to send someone out, and that's if they're feeling motivated."

"I have a pump in the kitchen that works," Sheldon offered.

"Ah! Good, good. Michiko-san always said that pump was the best thing about the house. Fed by the stream from the mountain—clean water, cold water, never fails even in summer droughts." She added matches to the growing pile. "You won't need to boil it, but do anyway, at least until you're sure the pipes are clear. Old houses hold surprises."

Rice. Pickled vegetables in glass jars. Dried fish. Instant noodles. Miso paste. A small bag of salt. A larger bag of rice crackers. Soap—hinoki cypress, she decided for him, because it was what her late husband had used and he had never smelled wrong a day in his life. A towel. A washcloth. A small broom and dustpan.

"You'll want futons," she said, pausing to consider. "I don't sell those, but I know who does. Kondo-san in the village has extras—her daughter moved to Osaka last year and left half her things behind. I'll call her tomorrow, have her bring some up."

"There are futons in the house already. In the closet."

"Michiko's futons?" Haruna's eyebrows rose. "They'll need airing. A full day in the sun, at least. You can use them tonight if you're desperate, but don't blame me if you wake up sneezing." She added a small packet of something to the pile. "Dried herbs. Put them between the layers. Helps with the must."

The total came to ¥3,400. More than he'd expected for basics, less than it might have been in a city. Sheldon paid in cash, watching Haruna's quick fingers sort the bills and coins with practiced ease.

"You're Kiyoshi's nephew," she said as she wrapped his purchases in a cloth bag. It wasn't a question. "The one from America. The physicist."

"Word travels fast."

"Word travels at the speed of concern." She handed him the bag, her eyes sharp despite the warmth in her voice. "People have been waiting for someone to come back to that house. Not just waiting—hoping. The Tsukinos were good people. Good neighbors. When Michiko passed and no one came..." She shrugged, a small gesture that carried years of accumulated disappointment. "We thought that was the end of it."

"I'm here now."

"Yes." She studied him for a moment longer, and Sheldon had the distinct impression of being measured against some internal standard. "You are. And you're staying?"

"I'm staying."

Whatever test that represented, he seemed to pass it. Haruna's face softened into something that looked almost like relief.

"Good. That's good." She reached under the counter and produced a small paper package—wrapped sweets, from the look of it. "For tonight. Don't argue, it's a gift. Michiko used to love these, and I still make them the same way her mother taught me."

---

He was almost to the door when Haruna spoke again.

"The shrine."

Sheldon turned. "Ma'am?"

"You'll need somewhere to stay while the house gets sorted. Masaki Shrine is just up the path—three hundred and twenty steps to the top, but the priest's residence is closer, maybe two hundred steps if you take the side path." She gestured vaguely toward the mountain. "Katsuhito-san is a good man. Quiet, but good. He takes in travelers sometimes, when there's need. And there's a child there—Tenchi, his grandson. Four years old, almost five. Lost his mother last year, poor thing."

Yamamoto had mentioned the same details. The priest who knew his grandmother. The child who'd lost his mother. The shrine that sat above everything, watching over the village like it had for centuries.

"Yamamoto-san said the priest might know something about my family."

"Katsuhito-san knows something about everyone's family. He's been here longer than anyone can remember." She paused, something flickering behind her eyes—not suspicion, exactly, but something adjacent to it. Awareness, maybe. The kind of look that suggested she knew more than she was saying and had decided, for now, to say nothing. "You should go before it gets dark. The steps are tricky in low light, and you look like you've had a long day."

He had. Longer than she could possibly imagine.

"Thank you, Haruna-san. For everything."

"Come back when you need more. I'm here every day except Sundays, and even then I'm usually here anyway because old habits die harder than old women." She smiled, and the years fell away from her face for just a moment. "Welcome home, Tsukino-san. It's about time someone came back."

---

The path toward the shrine branched off the main road just past Haruna's shop, marked by a simple wooden sign and the first of what would apparently be three hundred and twenty stone steps. The light was golden now, the sun hanging low over the western mountains, and Sheldon could feel the weight of the day settling into his bones.

He had supplies. He had directions. He had a house that was technically habitable and a village that seemed cautiously willing to accept him.

What he didn't have was clarity.

The presence that had placed him here—the system, whatever it was—had given him a life. Documents, money, a family history, property. Everything he needed to exist in this time and place as a person with roots and connections and a future. But it hadn't given him instructions. Hadn't explained what he was supposed to do with any of it.

*Live well*, something whispered in his memory. The only guidance he'd received.

The shrine rose above him, invisible beyond the trees but present nonetheless—a weight on the edge of his awareness, like standing near something large in the dark. The priest there might have answers. Or he might just have hospitality and a spare room, which at this point would be almost as valuable.

Sheldon shifted the cloth bag to his other hand and began to climb.

---


### Scene 1.6: The 320 Steps
**17:30 — Ascent to Masaki Shrine**


The first hundred steps were manageable.

Stone worn smooth by centuries of feet, each one slightly different from the last—some tilted, some cracked, some settled into the mountain at angles that required attention. The forest pressed close on either side, bamboo and cedar filtering the fading sunlight into shifting patterns on the path ahead. Sheldon climbed with the methodical pace of someone who knew better than to rush, his body already running on reserves he hadn't known he possessed.

The cloth bag from Haruna's store hung from his left hand, swinging gently with each step. Candles, matches, rice, soap. The supplies for a life he was still learning how to live.

The second hundred steps were harder.

The path curved here, switchbacking up the steeper portion of the mountainside, and Sheldon felt the accumulated weight of the day pressing down on him with each elevation gained. His legs burned. His lungs worked harder than they should have for what amounted to a moderate climb. Whatever reserves his body had drawn upon during the walk from the field were running low now, the account overdrawn and demanding payment.

*Haruna said there was a side path*, he remembered. *Two hundred steps to the residence instead of three hundred twenty to the top.*

He found it at the next landing—a narrower trail branching off to the right, marked by a small wooden sign with characters too weathered to read in the failing light. Sheldon took it without hesitation. Pride could wait. Survival couldn't.

The side path wound through older growth, trees that had been standing when his grandparents—his constructed grandparents, his given grandparents—had been young. The air was cooler here, touched with the particular dampness of mountain forest, and somewhere above him he could hear water moving. A stream, maybe, or a spring feeding down toward the lake he'd glimpsed from the Tsukino garden.

Eighty more steps. Sixty. Forty.

The trees thinned.

---

The shrine grounds opened before him like something from a different century.

Traditional buildings with dark wooden walls and curved roofs, arranged around a central courtyard swept clean of leaves and debris. Stone lanterns lined the paths, unlit but waiting. A massive tree dominated one corner of the grounds—ancient, impossibly ancient, its trunk wider than any tree Sheldon had ever seen, its branches spreading in a canopy that seemed to catch the last light of day and hold it. Something about that tree drew the eye and held it, demanded attention in a way that felt almost physical.

*Sacred*, Sheldon thought, though he didn't know where the word came from. *That tree is sacred to this place.*

A stone water basin stood near the entrance to the main courtyard—a chōzuya, the purification fountain found at every shrine. Water flowed into it from a bamboo spout, the sound gentle and constant, the kind of white noise that had probably been playing here since before anyone alive could remember.

The courtyard itself was empty. Peaceful. The light was amber now, the sun dropping behind the western peaks, and long shadows stretched across the swept stone like fingers reaching for the buildings.

Sheldon stood at the edge of the space, uncertain how to proceed. This was a shrine—a religious site, not a hotel. You didn't just walk in and ask for a room. There were protocols, courtesies, ways of doing things that his years in Kyoto had taught him to respect even if he didn't fully understand them.

But Haruna had said the priest took in travelers. And Sheldon was, at this moment, very much a traveler in need of taking in.

"You climbed all the way up."

The voice came from his left, calm and unhurried, carrying the particular quality of someone who had seen enough in life to be surprised by very little. Sheldon turned.

The old man stood perhaps ten meters away, near one of the smaller buildings, a bamboo broom resting against his shoulder. White hair, thin but not sparse, pulled back in a simple tie. A face weathered by decades of sun and wind, deep lines carved around eyes that were sharper than their setting suggested. He wore the simple robes of a Shinto priest—white kosode, light blue hakama—and stood with the easy posture of someone completely at home in his own body despite his apparent age.

Katsuhito. It had to be.

"Masaki-san?" Sheldon managed, his voice rougher than he'd expected. The climb had taken more out of him than he'd realized.

"Just Katsuhito is fine. 'Masaki-san' makes me sound like my father." The old priest's lips curved slightly—not quite a smile, but something related to it. "You're the one they've been talking about. The Tsukino heir from America."

The village information network. Of course.

"Tsukino Sheldon." He bowed—deeper than he had for Yamamoto, deeper than social convention strictly required, because something about this place demanded respect. "I apologize for arriving unannounced. Haruna-san said you sometimes offer hospitality to travelers, and I—"

"Your house isn't habitable yet." Katsuhito said it as simple fact, not question. "No power. Roof needs work. The pump works, but that's about all." He studied Sheldon with an expression that was impossible to read—assessment, certainly, but of what kind Sheldon couldn't tell. "You look like you've had a long journey."

"Longer than I expected."

Something flickered behind the old priest's eyes. Recognition of some kind, though what he was recognizing Sheldon couldn't guess.

"Come," Katsuhito said, turning toward the largest of the residential buildings. "You can wash the road off your feet and have tea while we talk. The bath won't be ready until after dinner, but the water basin in the hall should serve for now."

"I don't want to impose—"

"You're not imposing." The correction was gentle but firm. "You're accepting hospitality. There's a difference. On this mountain, we don't send strangers away at dusk with nowhere to go. That's not how things are done."

Sheldon opened his mouth to protest further, then closed it. The old man was right. He had nowhere else to go. He was exhausted, hungry, running on nothing but water from Haruna's shop and determination. And refusing genuine hospitality—hospitality offered without apparent strings—would be foolish at best, insulting at worst.

"Thank you," he said. "I'm grateful."

"Good." Katsuhito picked up his broom, considered it for a moment, then set it aside against the building wall. "The sweeping can wait until morning. It always does."

---

The interior of the residence was dim and cool, the last light of day filtering through paper screens to cast everything in soft amber. Sheldon removed his shoes at the genkan, stepping up onto the raised wooden floor in his socks, following Katsuhito through a narrow hallway toward what looked like a main living area.

The house smelled of wood and incense and something cooking—rice, maybe, and vegetables, the ordinary aromatics of a household preparing an evening meal. Somewhere deeper in the building, Sheldon could hear movement—the soft clatter of dishes, the slide of a cabinet door. Through a gap in one of the paper screens, he caught a glimpse of someone in the kitchen: a girl, young, maybe fifteen or sixteen, her dark hair pulled back as she stirred something on the stove. She didn't look up as they passed.

"The basin is there." Katsuhito gestured toward a small alcove where a ceramic bowl sat on a wooden stand, a folded towel beside it. "I'll bring tea. Rea is preparing dinner—there will be enough for one more."

He disappeared through a sliding door, leaving Sheldon alone in the hallway.

The water in the basin was cool and clean, and Sheldon washed his hands and face with the particular gratitude of someone who had been dirty for longer than he'd realized. The towel was soft, worn smooth by countless washings, and smelled faintly of sun and cedar. Simple things. Ordinary things. The kind of details that grounded a person in the reality of being alive.

He was drying his face when he heard the footsteps.

Small footsteps. Quick and light, the unmistakable rhythm of a child in motion.

Sheldon turned.

The boy stood at the end of the hallway, frozen in the particular way of children who had come to investigate something and found more than they expected. He was small—very small, the compact size of early childhood, maybe a hundred centimeters tall. Black hair cut in a simple bowl shape, sticking up slightly in the back. Dark eyes, wide and curious, fixed on Sheldon with an intensity that adults learned to disguise but children never bothered hiding.

Four years old. Almost five.

*Tenchi*, Sheldon's mind supplied. *The grandson. Lost his mother last year.*

For a long moment, neither of them moved. The boy stared at Sheldon with the frank assessment of someone who hadn't yet learned that staring was impolite. Sheldon stared back, uncertain what to do, how to act, what expression would be appropriate for meeting a child in someone else's home at the end of an impossible day.

"Your face is different," the boy said finally.

Sheldon blinked. "Different?"

"Different from other people's faces. It's darker." The observation was matter-of-fact, carrying no judgment—just a child noting something he hadn't seen before and trying to understand it. "Why?"

Before Sheldon could formulate a response, Katsuhito's voice came from somewhere behind the boy. "Tenchi." Gentle correction, not rebuke.

The boy—Tenchi—turned his head slightly but didn't take his eyes off Sheldon. "I'm not being rude, Ojii-chan. I'm asking a question. You said asking questions is how we learn things."

"That's true." Katsuhito appeared in the hallway, a tea tray in his hands, his expression carrying something that might have been amusement. "But some questions are better asked with context. This is Tsukino Sheldon. He's come from America—that's a country far away, across the ocean. Many people there have skin like his."

Tenchi considered this information with the seriousness of a scholar evaluating new data. "Is America where Mommy went?"

The question hung in the air. Sheldon saw something flicker across Katsuhito's face—grief, carefully controlled, never fully absent.

"No," the old priest said quietly. "Mommy went somewhere else. Somewhere we can't visit yet."

Tenchi nodded, accepting this as he apparently accepted most things—completely, without the doubt that came with age. Then his attention returned to Sheldon, the previous topic already processing in whatever way children processed information they didn't fully understand.

"Are you staying for dinner?"

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, uncertain of the answer.

"He's staying for dinner," Katsuhito confirmed. "And tonight, and perhaps longer. He's going to sleep in the room with the squeaky door."

"The guest room!" Tenchi's face transformed, grief forgotten in the immediate excitement of new information. "That's where Daddy sleeps when he visits. He keeps his baseball cards in the closet. Don't touch them—he gets upset."

"I won't touch them," Sheldon promised.

"Good." Tenchi studied him for another moment, then apparently reached some internal decision. "I'm Tenchi. I'm four, but I'm going to be five soon. Ojii-chan says I can have mochi for my birthday if I'm good until then."

"That sounds like a good deal."

"It is." Tenchi nodded gravely. "I'm being very good."

Katsuhito set the tea tray on a low table in the room beyond the hallway, his movements economical and practiced. "Tenchi, go wash your hands for dinner. You can talk to Tsukino-san more afterward."

"Okay." Tenchi looked at Sheldon one more time, his expression unreadable in the way children's expressions often were—too much happening behind those eyes to track. "I'm glad you're staying. Ojii-chan only has me and Rea-neechan to talk to, and I don't know very many words yet."

He turned and padded down the hallway, his small feet making almost no sound on the wooden floor. A moment later, Sheldon heard water running somewhere deeper in the house.

Katsuhito gestured toward the table. "Sit. The tea will help."

---

The tea was hot and bitter and exactly what Sheldon needed. He sat across from Katsuhito in the traditional style—seiza, knees folded beneath him—and let the warmth spread through his chest while the old priest watched him with those sharp, unreadable eyes.

"The Tsukino house," Katsuhito said after a long silence. "You've seen it?"

"This afternoon. After Yamamoto-san dropped me at the turn."

"And?"

Sheldon considered the question, the many ways he could answer it. "It needs work. The roof, especially. But the structure is sound. The pump works—the water runs clear. And there are futons in the closet, though Haruna-san says they'll need airing."

"Haruna would know. She knows everything that happens on this mountain." Katsuhito's lips curved again—that almost-smile that seemed to be his default expression. "She called ahead. Warned me you might be coming this way."

"The village information network."

"Faster than any telephone." Katsuhito poured more tea, the gesture smooth and practiced. "Your grandmother was Tsukino Hana. I knew her, when I was younger. A strong woman. She helped many people in this village, including my own family."

"Yamamoto-san said something similar."

"He would. The Yamamotos have long memories." Katsuhito set down the teapot, his hands folding in his lap with the stillness of someone who had learned patience over more years than most people could imagine. "You've come a long way to claim a house that needs repairs and a name that most people here have nearly forgotten. Why?"

It was the first direct question anyone had asked him. Not *are you okay* or *what do you need*, but *why*. The question beneath all the others.

Sheldon thought about his answer. The true answer—*I died, and something brought me back, and this is where it put me*—was impossible. The constructed answer—*my mother's family, my inheritance, my roots*—was technically accurate but felt hollow. What came out was something in between.

"I needed somewhere to belong," he said. "Somewhere that was mine, not borrowed or temporary or contingent on someone else's approval. My mother talked about this place when I was young. She never came back, but I think she always meant to." The lies blended with whatever truth he could find, creating something that felt almost honest. "I'm here because she couldn't be. To see what she left behind. To decide if I can make it mine."

Katsuhito studied him for a long moment. The silence stretched, comfortable rather than awkward, the kind of quiet that happened between people who didn't need to fill every moment with words.

"The house will take time," the old priest said finally. "Weeks before it's truly livable. Months before it feels like home. You can stay here while the work is being done. The guest room isn't much—the door squeaks, as Tenchi mentioned, and the futon is older than he is—but it doesn't leak, and you'll have meals and a bath and company if you want it."

"That's generous."

"It's practical." Katsuhito's eyes held something Sheldon couldn't identify—assessment, certainly, but also something else. Interest, maybe. The look of someone who had seen something unexpected and was trying to understand what it meant. "Tenchi needs more adults in his life. His father works in the city—comes back on weekends when he can, but that's not enough. I do my best, but I'm old, and children need more than one person to raise them properly."

"I'm not sure I'd be much help with children."

"You'd be surprised." Katsuhito rose, the movement fluid despite his apparent age. "Dinner will be ready soon. I'll show you the room—you can leave your things there, rest if you need to. We eat simply here, but there's always enough."

Sheldon stood, his legs protesting the transition from seiza. "Thank you. For all of this. I know it's more than I have any right to expect."

Katsuhito paused at the door, looking back with an expression that might have been amusement or might have been something else entirely.

"On this mountain," he said, "we take care of each other. That's how it's always been. That's how it will continue to be, as long as I have anything to say about it."

He slid the door open and gestured for Sheldon to follow. Somewhere deeper in the house, Tenchi's voice was singing something—off-key but enthusiastic, the kind of noise that only children made.

Sheldon picked up his bag of supplies and followed the old priest into the dimness of the hallway. Behind him, through the paper screens, the last light of day was fading to purple and gold.

His first day in this new life was almost over.

He had survived it.

### Scene 1.7: First Dinner
**18:30 — Evening at the shrine residence**


The dining room was small and traditional—tatami mats, a low table that had been polished by years of use, sliding doors that opened onto the engawa and the darkening garden beyond. Four cushions had been arranged around the table, and the girl from the kitchen was setting out dishes with the practiced efficiency of someone who had done this hundreds of times before.

She looked up when Sheldon entered behind Katsuhito, and for a moment their eyes met.

Fifteen, maybe sixteen. Dark hair pulled back in a simple ponytail, a few strands escaping to frame a face that was carefully neutral. She wore a plain blue apron over a white blouse and dark skirt—practical clothes, the kind worn by someone who expected to work rather than be observed. Her hands paused in their motion, a serving bowl suspended between table and tray, and she studied Sheldon with an expression that gave nothing away.

"Rea," Katsuhito said, his voice carrying the easy warmth of family, "this is Tsukino Sheldon. He'll be staying with us for a while. Sheldon, this is Rea. She keeps this household running."

The girl—Rea—inclined her head in a bow that was polite but measured. "Welcome, Tsukino-san. I hope you like nikujaga."

Her voice was soft but clear, and there was something in the way she held herself that suggested competence far beyond her years. Not quite adult, but not quite child either. Someone who had learned to be responsible before she should have had to.

"Thank you for having me," Sheldon said, returning the bow. "And for cooking. The house smells wonderful."

Something flickered across Rea's face—surprise, maybe, at the compliment, or assessment of whether it was genuine. Then she nodded once and returned to her work, setting out the remaining dishes with movements that were economical and precise.

Tenchi appeared from somewhere, his hair damp from washing, and immediately claimed the cushion next to where Sheldon was clearly expected to sit. "You're next to me," he announced, as if this were a matter of great importance that had been decided by forces beyond human control. "Rea-neechan is across, and Ojii-chan is at the end."

"Is that the usual arrangement?"

"It's the arrangement for tonight." Tenchi patted the cushion beside him. "Sit, sit. I'm hungry."

---

The meal was simple and exactly what Sheldon needed.

Rice, steaming and perfectly prepared. Nikujaga—a stew of beef and potatoes and onions in a sweet soy broth, the kind of home cooking that reminded him of his grandmother's kitchen even though the flavors were entirely different. Pickled vegetables, sharp and clean. Miso soup with tofu and green onions. And tea, of course, poured by Rea with the same quiet efficiency she brought to everything else.

They ate in a rhythm that felt practiced—Katsuhito at the head of the table, Rea and Tenchi on either side, Sheldon fitting into the space that had apparently been waiting for someone to fill it. The conversation was light, carried mostly by Tenchi's questions and Katsuhito's patient answers, with Rea contributing occasional quiet observations that suggested she was listening to everything even when she wasn't speaking.

"Tsukino-san, do you like it?" Tenchi asked, watching Sheldon eat with the particular intensity of a child who had decided this stranger's opinion mattered.

"It's delicious." Sheldon meant it. The nikujaga was perfectly balanced—not too sweet, not too salty, the beef tender and the potatoes soft without being mushy. "Did you make this, Rea-san?"

The girl looked up from her own bowl, something unreadable in her expression. "It was Kiyone-san's recipe," she said quietly. "I learned it from her."

The name landed in the room like a stone dropped into still water. Tenchi's chopsticks paused in their motion. Katsuhito's eyes flickered toward Rea with something that might have been concern or might have been warning.

"My mother," Tenchi said, filling the silence with the matter-of-fact directness of childhood. "She taught Rea-neechan how to cook before she went away."

"She was a good teacher," Rea said, her voice steady. "I try to make things the way she would have."

The moment stretched, fragile and heavy, and Sheldon recognized it for what it was: grief, held carefully, present in every meal and every ritual and every quiet moment of a household that had learned to function around an absence. Rea cooked Kiyone's recipes. Katsuhito maintained his composure. Tenchi asked his questions and accepted the answers he was given. And the empty space at the table—the cushion that wasn't set out, the portion that wasn't served—existed whether anyone acknowledged it or not.

"It's perfect," Sheldon said, because it was true and because sometimes the only thing you could do with grief was acknowledge the love that had created it. "Thank you for sharing it with me."

Rea's expression softened, just slightly. "You're welcome, Tsukino-san."

---

After dinner, Tenchi insisted on showing Sheldon his collection of wooden blocks.

"Ojii-chan carved them," he explained, leading Sheldon to a corner of the main room where a basket overflowed with shapes of various sizes. "See? This one is a tree, and this one is a horse, and this one is supposed to be a person but it looks more like a stick."

"That's because people are difficult," Katsuhito said from across the room, where he was helping Rea clear the dishes. "Trees and horses have simpler shapes."

"You could practice more."

"I could. But then who would sweep the steps?"

Tenchi considered this logic and apparently found it acceptable. He returned his attention to Sheldon, pressing a wooden block into his hands—a rough approximation of a house, with a peaked roof and a door carved into one side.

"This is my favorite," the boy said. "It's a house. Like the one you're going to fix."

Sheldon turned the block over in his hands, feeling the smoothness of the wood, the care that had gone into shaping it even if the result wasn't quite professional. Someone had made this for a child. Someone had taken the time to carve something that a small boy could hold and imagine with.

"It's a good house," he said.

"It needs a garden." Tenchi pointed to the flat base. "See? No garden. Real houses have gardens."

"Your grandfather could carve one."

"I asked. He said gardens are too hard because they have too many small things." Tenchi sighed with the exasperation of someone whose aesthetic vision exceeded his available resources. "Maybe you could do it. Do you know how to carve?"

"I don't. But I could learn."

The boy's face lit up. "Really? You'd learn? For my house?"

"I'd try. I can't promise it would be good."

"That's okay. Ojii-chan's carvings aren't good either, and I love them anyway."

From across the room, Katsuhito made a sound that might have been a laugh or might have been a sigh. "The bath is ready," he said. "Tsukino-san, you should go first. You've had a long day."

---

The ofuro was small but deep, the water hot enough to send steam curling toward the wooden ceiling. Sheldon washed himself first at the small station beside the tub—soap and water and a wooden bucket, the traditional way—then lowered himself into the bath with a groan that came from somewhere deep in his bones.

The heat was almost unbearable for the first few seconds, then shifted to something else entirely: comfort, release, the sensation of muscles unwinding that had been clenched for longer than he'd realized. The water came up to his chest, and he leaned back against the smooth wooden edge, letting his eyes close.

His first day.

He had woken in a field that wasn't his, in a body that was his but also wasn't, in a time that shouldn't have existed for him at all. He had walked through rice paddies and ridden in trucks and climbed hundreds of stone steps. He had met a farmer who remembered his mother, a shopkeeper who welcomed him home, a priest who offered hospitality without asking questions, a child who accepted him without hesitation, and a girl who carried her grief quietly and cooked perfect nikujaga from a dead woman's recipes.

He had a house that needed repairs and a name that came with history and a village that seemed willing to accept him as something other than a stranger.

*Live well*, the presence had said. The only instruction.

He wasn't sure yet what that meant. Wasn't sure what he was supposed to do, or become, or accomplish in this life that had been given to him without explanation. But he was alive. He was here. And for the first time since waking in the chrysanthemum field, he felt something that might have been hope.

The water held him, warm and forgiving. Outside, through the small window, stars were becoming visible in the darkening sky.

He stayed in the bath until the heat had soaked into his bones, until the exhaustion had shifted from burden to weight, until his body felt ready to sleep for a very long time.

---

The guest room was exactly as advertised.

Small—six tatami mats, barely enough space for a futon and the closet that Tenchi had warned contained untouchable baseball cards. A single window, paper-screened, letting in the faint light of stars and the distant glow of what might have been the village below. A low table with a candle that someone had already lit, casting everything in soft amber shadows.

And the door squeaked.

It wasn't a loud squeak—just a soft protest of wood against wood, the complaint of hinges that had been opening and closing for decades. But it was distinctive, the kind of sound you would learn to recognize, the kind of sound that would tell you someone was coming or going even in the dark.

Sheldon slid the door closed behind him, hearing that squeak again, and stood for a moment in the center of the small room.

Someone had laid out the futon while he was bathing. The quilts were old but clean, smelling faintly of sun and cedar—aired recently, then, or at least stored with care. A small pillow sat at the head, and beside it, folded neatly, was a yukata for sleeping.

*Rea*, he thought. She had done this. Set out the futon, lit the candle, made sure a stranger would have what he needed for his first night in an unfamiliar place. The same quiet competence she brought to everything else.

He changed into the yukata, extinguished the candle, and lay down on the futon in the darkness. The quilts were heavier than he expected, warm despite the spring chill, and the tatami beneath him had the particular firmness of floors that had been walked on for generations.

Through the paper screens, he could see the faint shapes of stars. Through the walls, he could hear the distant sounds of the household settling—Katsuhito's measured footsteps, Tenchi's voice asking one more question, Rea's soft response. The ordinary noises of people living together, ending their day, preparing for sleep.

His eyes were heavy. His body was finally, completely exhausted, the kind of exhaustion that came from walking too far and thinking too much and feeling things that didn't have names yet.

Tomorrow, he would begin to figure out what came next. Tomorrow, he would look at the house and make plans and start the process of building something from the pieces he'd been given.

But tonight—tonight he would sleep. In a room with a squeaky door, in a shrine on a mountain, in a life that shouldn't have been his but somehow was.

*Live well.*

He closed his eyes.
