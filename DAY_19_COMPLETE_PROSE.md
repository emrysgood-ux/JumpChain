## SCENE 1: WAKING IN NEW SPACE
**Time:** 05:20:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The second morning arrived differently than the first.

Yesterday had been novelty—unfamiliar ceiling, unfamiliar sounds, the displacement of sleeping somewhere new. Today, those same elements registered as the beginning of pattern. This ceiling would greet him tomorrow, and the day after, and for however long he remained on this mountain.

The futon released him with minimal resistance. His body had found comfortable positions during the night, evidence of adaptation proceeding beneath conscious awareness. The room retained night coolness that would fade as morning advanced.

Three days until Tenchi's birthday. The countdown continued regardless of address.

---

## SCENE 2: KITCHEN CONFIDENCE
**Time:** 05:50:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, kitchen

The kitchen felt different without the anticipation of others.

At the shrine, mornings had begun with awareness of Katsuhito waking, Tenchi stirring, the household preparing for its day. Here, the only presence was his own reflection in the window above the sink—a face still surprising in its youth, eyes that had learned to expect different features.

Rice from the cooker, the timer function working as promised. Miso from powder—adequate, not excellent. Vegetables that needed using before they turned. The meal assembled through motions his hands had learned over seventeen days.

He ate standing at the window, watching light strengthen over the valley. The village below showed morning routines as movement in distant windows. An audience he couldn't hear but could imagine.

---

## SCENE 3: MORNING WALK
**Time:** 06:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from Tsukino House toward shrine

Habit pulled him uphill before purpose redirected.

Seventeen days of descending from shrine to house had established muscle memory. Now that pattern required reversal. Sheldon caught himself climbing the familiar path and laughed—a sound that echoed strangely in morning quiet. Old patterns dying hard, new ones taking time.

The shrine path remained available for visits. Today, though, the carpenters would arrive at his house. The work site was now also his residence. The destination and origin had merged.

He turned back, descending toward the Tsukino house with deliberate attention to each step. This path too would become automatic. But today it still required thought.

---

## SCENE 4: CARPENTERS ARRIVE
**Time:** 07:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, entrance

Yamada and Takeshi appeared with the regularity of tide.

"You slept here." The carpenter read evidence from context—Sheldon's presence before their arrival, the slightly rumpled look of someone who hadn't traveled far.

"First full night. The bath worked properly."

"Good. Today we continue interior finishing. You can observe or help—your house, your choice."

The autonomy felt strange after weeks of following instructions. "What needs attention?"

"Tokonoma refinishing. Shoji assessment. Engawa restoration on the southwest corner." Yamada listed tasks as if reading from internal notes. "Any of these interest you particularly?"

"The tokonoma. I want to understand what you're doing to it."

"Then you'll learn."

---

## SCENE 5: TOKONOMA WORK
**Time:** 08:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The alcove revealed itself under attention.

Yamada's hands moved over wooden surfaces with the diagnostic touch of a physician. "The grain here—see how it runs? Someone chose this wood carefully. The pattern creates depth when light catches it properly."

"It was covered by decades of grime."

"Grime protects as it obscures. The finish beneath survived because nothing reached it." The carpenter produced fine sandpaper. "Now we remove the protection and restore what it protected. Careful work—too aggressive and we damage what we're revealing."

The paper bird had been set aside, waiting to return to its place. Sheldon watched as the alcove's wood emerged from obscurity, grain patterns becoming visible that had been invisible yesterday.

---

## SCENE 6: LEARNING RHYTHM
**Time:** 10:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

Yamada handed him sandpaper.

"Your turn. Follow the grain, not against it. Light pressure—let the abrasive do the work."

The instruction seemed simple. The execution proved complex. Sheldon's first strokes left marks perpendicular to the wood's natural lines; Yamada's gentle correction redirected without criticism.

"Feel the resistance. The wood tells you which direction it prefers. When the paper glides easily, you're following. When it catches, you're fighting."

Adjustment by adjustment, Sheldon's technique improved. The alcove's left panel showed his work—imperfect but acceptable, the learning visible in gradually improving sections.

"Better," Yamada pronounced. "You'll never match what fifty years of practice produces. But competent—that's achievable."

---

## SCENE 7: VILLAGE RUN
**Time:** 11:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Village, general store

Lunch provisions required acquisition.

The walk to the village felt different from the Tsukino house—shorter than from the shrine, the path joining the main road earlier. Sheldon noted the change without analysis: mental map adjusting to new starting point.

Nakamura-san greeted him with established familiarity. "First full day in the house?"

"Yes."

"How did it feel waking there?"

"Like something that needs getting used to."

"Everything does." She assembled his modest order. "Usually within a week, the strangeness fades. Then it feels like yours."

---

## SCENE 8: POST OFFICE STOP
**Time:** 11:50:00 JST  
**Location:** Village, post office

Mail had accumulated.

Suzuki Taro produced an envelope bearing Kiyoshi's now-familiar handwriting, plus an official document from Kurashiki municipal offices.

"Property registration confirmation," Suzuki explained. "The transfer completed this week. Routine documentation."

"I didn't realize it was still pending."

"Katsuhito-sama handled the filing. Rural administration runs on relationships—official channels exist, but personal connections move faster."

The envelope joined Kiyoshi's letter in Sheldon's bag. Both would receive attention when time permitted.

---

## SCENE 9: LUNCH AT HOME
**Time:** 12:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

They ate surrounded by evidence of progress.

The tokonoma showed the morning's work—wood smoother, grain emerging. Tenchi's paper bird waited on the low table, its return imminent now that the alcove approached readiness.

"Your uncle writes often," Yamada observed, noting the letter.

"Family history. He's filling gaps I didn't know existed."

"Gaps always exist. Families are stories—versions, perspectives, details some remember and others forget." The carpenter finished his onigiri. "You're writing your own version now."

---

## SCENE 10: AFTERNOON APPLICATION
**Time:** 14:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

Oil followed sanding.

Yamada demonstrated application technique—thin coat, worked into grain, excess removed before it could pool. The wood drank the oil with visible appetite, color deepening as treatment penetrated.

"Tung oil," the carpenter explained. "Traditional finish. Protects without obscuring. The wood remains visible, the grain remains prominent. Modern finishes seal more thoroughly but hide what they protect."

"Which is better?"

"Neither. Different purposes, different results. For a tokonoma, you want visibility. The alcove displays; it shouldn't compete with what's displayed." He handed Sheldon a brush. "Your turn."

---

## SCENE 11: BIRD'S RETURN
**Time:** 16:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The oil had cured enough to permit.

Sheldon lifted Tenchi's origami creation with appropriate care. The alcove now showed its character—grain visible, wood protected, the space ready to receive whatever its occupant chose to display.

"Place it yourself," Yamada instructed. "The first placement sets the relationship."

The bird found its position in the alcove's center, angled to catch light from the window. The asymmetry that had marked its amateur creation somehow suited the setting—imperfection displayed with intention.

"Good placement," Yamada observed. "The bird looks comfortable."

---

## SCENE 12: END OF WORK DAY
**Time:** 17:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, entrance

The carpenters departed with satisfying progress made.

"Monday we continue," Yamada said. "The weekend is yours—rest, settle, let the house accept your presence."

"What should I do?"

"Whatever feels natural. Walk the property. Sit in different rooms. Learn how light moves, how sound carries." The instructions were practical beneath their mystical surface. "A house reveals itself to those who pay attention."

---

## SCENE 13: SHRINE VISIT
**Time:** 17:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Path to Masaki Shrine

The steps waited, familiar as heartbeat.

Sheldon climbed with the established rhythm—three hundred twenty steps, the count proceeding automatically, his legs finding the pace they'd learned over seventeen days. The ascent had been home-bound yesterday; today it was visit. The distinction changed nothing about the steps themselves.

The shrine appeared through thinning forest, its presence announcing itself before visibility confirmed. The particular stillness of sacred space, maintained through centuries of attention.

---

## SCENE 14: TENCHI'S GREETING
**Time:** 17:50:00 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, main gate

The boy had been watching for him.

"Sheldon-san! You came!" Tenchi's voice carried the triumph of confirmed prediction. "I told Grandfather you would!"

"I said I'd visit."

"I know, but you might have been busy. With your house." The qualifier showed awareness that adult priorities sometimes overrode promises. "Is the bird still there?"

"Still there. In the tokonoma. Yamada-san helped me finish the alcove today."

"Can I see tomorrow?"

"If your grandfather permits."

---

## SCENE 15: DINNER AT SHRINE
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Katsuhito had anticipated the visit.

"The meal accommodates three," the priest said by way of greeting. "I suspected you wouldn't stay away on your first full day."

"Was that assumption or calculation?"

"Experience. People who've lived here struggle to stay away immediately after leaving." He served rice with efficient motions. "The mountain has gravity—not physical, but emotional. It pulls."

Tenchi ate with the enthusiasm of someone whose favorite person had returned from imagined distances. The separation had lasted less than a day; his reaction suggested weeks.

---

## SCENE 16: EVENING CONVERSATION
**Time:** 19:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

They sat watching stars emerge.

"How does the house feel?" Katsuhito asked.

"Large. Empty. Mine." Sheldon considered the list. "The first two will fade. The third—I'm still adjusting to."

"Ownership is simpler as concept than as practice. Concepts require only thought. Practice requires presence, attention, response." The priest's voice carried the particular weight of experience. "Your house will demand things of you. Meeting those demands is what ownership actually means."

"Etsuko met them for decades."

"Etsuko had practice. And stubbornness. And no alternative she was willing to consider." A slight smile in the darkness. "You'll develop your own reasons for staying."

---

## SCENE 17: RETURN HOME
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to Tsukino House

The descent felt different at night.

Lantern light created moving shadows, the forest transformed by darkness into something both familiar and strange. Sheldon picked his way down the path that had been clear in daylight, each step requiring attention the morning walk hadn't demanded.

The Tsukino house appeared through trees—windows dark, structure a shadow against less-dark sky. His house, waiting. Tomorrow he would learn it better. Tonight, he would sleep in it again.

---

## SCENE 18: EVENING ROUTINE
**Time:** 21:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, interior

The bath required tending.

Fire caught on the second attempt—improvement from yesterday's three. The water warmed while Sheldon read Kiyoshi's letter by lamplight, the uncle's handwriting revealing family history in patient detail.

*Your grandmother spoke of the mountain throughout her life*, Kiyoshi wrote. *Not with longing, exactly—more like awareness. She knew it was there, knew it waited, knew someday someone would return. That you've returned would have pleased her deeply.*

The words carried weight beyond their content. Connection to people he'd never met, to a history he'd never lived, to a place that had somehow always been his even before he knew it existed.

---

## SCENE 19: NIGHT ARRIVAL
**Time:** 22:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

Sleep approached through layers.

The futon had become familiar enough that his body relaxed without conscious instruction. The house's sounds had begun sorting themselves into categories: normal settling, wind-caused, something to investigate. Most fell into the first two. None yet into the third.

Three days until Tenchi's birthday. Tomorrow, Saturday—Nobuyuki might arrive. The weekend would bring visitors, preparation, the accumulated social texture that made life more than mere existence.

But tonight was his. The house was his. The darkness held only what he brought to it.
