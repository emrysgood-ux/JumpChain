# PART 5: THE READER'S IRONY

Throughout Chapter 1, the reader knows what Sheldon doesn't:

| SHELDON PERCEIVES | READER KNOWS |
|---|---|
| Old priest with patience | 700-year-old Juraian prince (Yosho) |
| Sacred tree that "feels aware" | Royal Tree Funaho |
| Cave that triggers "wrongness" | Sealed Ryoko (700 years) |
| Motherless child | Future protagonist of canonical events |
| Normal village | 12 years until everything changes |
| Peaceful life | Preparation for cosmic battles |

The dramatic irony sustains the next twelve years: Sheldon building a life whose true nature he cannot perceive, loving people whose secrets he doesn't know, preparing for events he cannot imagine.
