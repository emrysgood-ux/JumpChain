## SCENE 1: THE AWAKENING
**Time:** 14:47:23 â€” 15:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, near Shiroato castle ruins, Asakuchi District  
**Word Target:** 2,500-3,000

### Environmental Details

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Terrain** | Gentle slope, ankle-high grass, scattered purple wildflowers (sumire) |
| **Temperature** | ~18Â°C (64Â°F), mild spring warmth |
| **Sky** | Deep blue, occasional white clouds |

| **Smell** | Green grass, damp earth, faint floral notes, distant woodsmoke |
| **Distance to road** | ~200 meters south |
| **Distance to shrine** | Several kilometers (requires bus) |

### Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Time | Content | Word Est. |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| 1.1 | 14:47:23-14:50 | Sensory awakening â€” smell of grass, face in earth, no thought yet | 300 |
| 1.2 | 14:50-14:55 | First awareness â€” "I exist" â€” body cataloguing begins | 350 |
| 1.3 | 14:55-15:00 | Death memory surfaces â€” Alaska, cascade failure, Maria Chen's face | 400 |
| 1.4 | 15:00-15:05 | Opening eyes â€” blue sky, sitting up (movement too easy) | 300 |
| 1.5 | 15:05-15:10 | Body examination â€” scar GONE, heart steady, no pain | 400 |
| 1.6 | 15:10-15:15 | Standing â€” effortless, environment assessment | 300 |
| 1.7 | 15:15-15:20 | Watch discovery â€” 2:47 PM, Seiko, someone dressed him | 250 |
| 1.8 | 15:20-15:25 | Wallet discovery â€” documents examined, identity shock | 500 |
| 1.9 | 15:25-15:30 | Decision â€” grandmother's voice: "Water, food, shelter" â€” walk toward road | 200 |

### Key Internal Moments

1. **Pre-thought sensation**: Raw input before cognition
2. **Death recognition**: "I died" â€” stated without panic, fact-processing
3. **Body wrongness**: Everything works too well â€” "fixed" not "healed"
4. **Identity fracture**: Tsukino Sheldon â€” not Carter â€” documents show a life he doesn't remember
5. **Grandmother's voice**: Dorothy Mae's survival rules override panic

### Seeds Planted

| Seed ID | Content | Payoff Target |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| SEED-001 | Body restored beyond normal human baseline | Ongoing (power development) |
| SEED-002 | Identity mystery â€” "Someone did this" | Arc-long |

### Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Time | Content | Word Est. |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| 2.1 | 15:30-15:40 | Walking through field â€” body awareness (feet, legs, lungs all work perfectly) | 400 |
| 2.2 | 15:40-15:50 | Reaching treeline â€” different trees than he knows (not redwoods, not Alaska spruce) | 350 |
| 2.3 | 15:50-16:00 | Emerging at road â€” rural Japan confirmed, sees road sign, bus stop in distance | 350 |

### Sensory Progression

| Segment | Sound | Sight | Touch | Smell |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Field crossing | Uguisu calls, grass swishing | Blue sky, mountains, treeline | Grass against ankles, sun warmth | Green growth, wildflowers |
| Treeline | Bird song changes, quieter | Dappled shade, cedar trunks | Cooler air, softer ground | Forest scent, cedar, earth |
| Road emergence | Distant engine, wind | Paved road, signage in Japanese, bus stop shelter | Pavement underfoot | Dust, sun-warmed asphalt |

### Key Observations (Sheldon's POV)

- Landscape is rural Japan â€” not Alaska, not Georgia, not California
- He can READ the Japanese signs (fluency confirmed â€” not surprising to him)
- Trees are different species than anything familiar
- Road is well-maintained but rural â€” one lane each direction
- Bus stop visible ~100 meters east along road

---

**Time:** 16:00:00 â€” 16:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop â†’ Local bus â†’ Masaki Village

### Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Time | Content | Word Est. |
|------|------|---------|-----------|

| 3.2 | 16:10-16:20 | Waiting â€” observing landscape, processing documents again | 400 |
| 3.3 | 16:20-16:25 | Bus arrives â€” small local bus, pays fare with coins | 200 |
| 3.4 | 16:25-16:40 | The ride â€” countryside passing, other passengers, Japanese radio | 400 |
| 3.5 | 16:40-16:45 | Arrival â€” "Jinja-mae" stop, asks elderly woman for directions | 350 |

### Bus Details (1989 Rural Japan)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bus type** | Small local route bus, cream and orange livery |
| **Fare** | Paid on entry, flat rate (~Â¥200) |

| **Driver** | Male, 50s, uniform, professional demeanor |
| **Duration** | ~15-20 minutes |
| **Radio** | Japanese pop music, weather forecast |

### First Human Interaction

**Character:** Elderly woman at bus stop (Yamamoto Haruko, 68)  
**Exchange:**
- Sheldon asks: "Sumimasen â€” Masaki-jinja wa dochira desu ka?" (Excuse me â€” which way is Masaki Shrine?)
- Woman's reaction: Surprise at foreigner's fluent Japanese, then warmth
- Directions: Points to torii visible at mountain base, explains 320 steps

**Sheldon's observation:** His Japanese is perfect. Kyoto-trained accent. NOT Okayama dialect. The woman notices his speech is formal, educated.

---

## SCENE 4: THE ASCENT
**Time:** 16:45:00 â€” 17:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine base â†’ 320 stone steps â†’ Shrine grounds

### Beat Breakdown

| Beat | Time | Content | Word Est. |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| 4.1 | 16:45-16:50 | Shrine base â€” temizu-ya purification, proper form (grandmother taught) | 350 |
| 4.2 | 16:50-17:00 | Steps 1-100 â€” fresh, strong, observing ancient stonework | 350 |
| 4.3 | 17:00-17:10 | Steps 101-200 â€” breathing deeper, first torii gate, forest closes in | 350 |
| 4.4 | 17:10-17:20 | Steps 201-300 â€” legs feel the climb, stone lanterns appear | 300 |
| 4.5 | 17:20-17:30 | Steps 301-320 â€” final push, shrine grounds open before him | 250 |

### Step Count: EXACTLY 320
**Source:** Based on real Tarojinja shrine  
**NOT 300. NOT 500. EXACTLY 320.**

### Physical State Progression

| Step Range | Heart Rate | Breathing | Legs | Mental State |
|------------|------------|-----------|------|--------------|
| 1-100 | Normal | Easy | Fresh | Curiosity, wonder |
| 101-200 | Elevated | Deeper | Warming | Determination |

| 301-320 | Peak | Controlled | Achievement | Arrival |

### Temizu-ya (Purification Fountain) Details

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Stone basin, bamboo ladle, dragon water spout |
| **Water** | Cold, clear, mountain spring |
| **Ritual** | Left hand, right hand, rinse mouth, handle â€” grandmother's teaching |

### Observation: Body Performance
Sheldon notices: This climb should be harder. His body handles 320 steps better than it should. Better than his pre-death body ever could. More evidence of being "fixed."

## SCENE 5: FIRST CONTACT
**Time:** 17:30:00 â€” 18:00:00 JST

| 5.2 | 17:35-17:40 | Katsuhito emerges â€” physical description through Sheldon's eyes | 400 |

| Location | "This is Masaki Shrine. I am Masaki Katsuhito." | Slight bow, "I'm Sheldon." |
| Assessment | "The mountain accepted you." | Confusion â€” what does that mean? |
| Offer | "This shrine has room for those who need it." | "Thank you." (genuine relief) |

### Katsuhito's Assessment (What Sheldon Doesn't Know)

Katsuhito notices something unusual about this visitor. Not consciously identified, but:
- The way Sheldon holds himself
- Something in the quality of his presence
- The mountain did not resist his approach (Funaho's acceptance)

**SEED PLANTED:** Katsuhito will watch this man carefully.

### Tour Route

| Stop | Time | Katsuhito's Comment | Sheldon's Observation |
|------|------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Main shrine building | 18:32 | "For prayer and offerings" | Ancient, well-maintained |
| Office | 18:35 | "Where I work" | Books, papers, smell of incense |
| Lake viewpoint | 18:38 | "Masaki Lake" | Deep blue-green, calm, beautiful |
| Tsukino House | 18:45 | "This belonged to the Tsukino family. Now it's yours." | Shock â€” this is REAL |

| **Bathroom** | Traditional, ofuro tub, clean | Simple, dignified |

### Key Moment: Reality Confirmation

The property deed in his wallet matches this house. The koseki shows his family owned this land. Whatever happened to him, it was thorough. His identity here is REAL â€” not a cover story.

## SCENE 8: DINNER PREPARATION
**Time:** 19:00:00 â€” 19:30:00 JST

| Setting rice cooker | Electric, shown once | 19:25-19:28 | Quick learner |

### Internal Observation

Sheldon notices: These tasks are familiar. His hands know what to do. Dorothy Mae's kitchen, a lifetime ago (a lifetime ago in a dead timeline), taught him this. The skills survived.

---

### Sheldon's Food Experience

First meal in this new body. Every flavor is vivid, precise. His restored senses register detail his old body would have missed. The rice has individual grains. The fish has layers of flavor. The soup is warmth itself.

**Location:** Main house  
**Word Target:** 800-1,000

| Time | Energy Level | Behavior |
|------|--------------|----------|
| 20:30-20:40 | Moderate | Yawning, quieter |
| 20:40-20:50 | Low | Sleepy, clingy with grandfather |

**Sheldon:** "I'm grateful. More than I can express."  
**Katsuhito:** "Rest well. Tomorrow begins early."

## SCENE 11: BATH
**Time:** 21:00:00 â€” 21:30:00 JST

| 11.2 | 21:05-21:15 | Washing â€” proper Japanese method (wash outside, soak inside) | 400 |

| 11.4 | 21:25-21:30 | Dressing â€” clothes provided by Katsuhito | 150 |

### Japanese Bath Protocol

1. **Wash first** â€” stool, bucket, soap outside the tub
2. **Rinse completely** â€” no soap enters the bath
3. **Enter tub** â€” hot soak only after washing
4. **Soak** â€” for warmth and relaxation, not cleaning

### Body Examination (During Soak)

Sheldon examines his body in the bath:
- No scars anywhere
- Skin smooth, unmarked
- Muscle definition he never had
- Everything works perfectly
- Body feels thirty years old, not thirty-eight

### Processing Moment

The heat relaxes something in him. For the first time since awakening, he allows himself to feel:
- He died. He remembers dying.
- He's alive. He doesn't understand how.
- Someone gave him this. Identity, body, place.
- He doesn't know who. Or why.
- But he's here. And he'll earn this chance.

| **Smell** | Night-blooming flowers, forest, wood smoke from main house |
| **Touch** | Cool night air (~12Â°C), stone path under feet |

### Internal State

First time walking to "his" house. The concept sits strangely. He owns property now. He has an address. He belongs somewhere.

### Beat Breakdown

| 5 | "These people are kind." |
| 6 | "The boy â€” Tenchi â€” innocent, curious." |
| 7 | "The old man â€” Katsuhito â€” knows more than he shows." |
| 8 | "I'll be useful. I'll earn this." |
| 9 | "Tomorrow..." |
| 10 | (Thoughts fragmenting, sleep taking hold) |

### Final Conscious Moment

Sound of wind in cedar trees. Warmth of futon against spring chill. The smell of tatami â€” grass and age. Absolute stillness.

Sleep.

## SCENE 15: DREAM SEQUENCE
**Time:** During sleep  
**Location:** Dreamscape  
**Word Target:** 600-800

### Structure

Two dreams, intercut:

**Dream A: Grandmother's Kitchen**
- Dorothy Mae's kitchen, Georgia, decades ago
- Smell of biscuits, morning light through yellow curtains
- Her voice: "You always were too stubborn to stay dead."
- Warmth, safety, love

**Dream B: The White Figure**
- Bright space, no walls, no floor
- Figure in white at edge of vision
- Tall, slender, features unclear
- Patient, gentle, infinitely sad
- Watching him with recognition
- "They know me. They've always known me."
- He reaches toward them â€”

He wakes. Morning. Day 2.

### Critical POV Rules for Dream

- Sheldon does NOT identify the white figure
- Reader KNOWS it's Cosmos; Sheldon does NOT
- No forbidden words (Cosmos, Sailor, etc.)
- The figure is "someone" or "they" â€” never named
- Emotional resonance without exposition
