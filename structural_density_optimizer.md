## Description

Balances high-intensity and low-intensity scenes to avoid pacing fatigue. Applies micro and macro pacing curves to ensure reader engagement is maintained across chapter, arc, and story-level structures.

---

## PART I: OBJECTIVES

### 1.1 Primary Goals
- Track narrative density across all story units (scene, chapter, arc)
- Apply appropriate pacing curves at micro and macro levels
- Reduce back-to-back introspection or action overload
- Create breathing room after intense sequences
- Build toward climaxes with appropriate escalation

### 1.2 Secondary Goals
- Prevent reader exhaustion in long-form narrative
- Balance character development with plot momentum
- Ensure genre expectations (slice-of-life to action transitions) are honored
- Maintain engagement during necessary slower passages

---

## PART II: DENSITY DEFINITIONS

### 2.1 Scene Intensity Levels

| Level | Name | Characteristics | Example |
|-------|------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | **Rest** | Minimal conflict, domestic comfort, recovery | Morning tea scene |
| 2 | **Low** | Gentle tension, character interaction, mild stakes | Village shopping trip |
| 3 | **Medium** | Active conflict, emotional stakes, decisions required | Argument with family member |
| 4 | **High** | Significant threat, major revelation, intense emotion | Discovering hidden truth |
| 5 | **Peak** | Maximum stakes, climax events, irreversible change | Canon character reveal, battle |

### 2.2 Density Components

Each scene's density is calculated from:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Action** | 25% | Physical events, movement, combat |
| **Emotion** | 30% | Character feelings, relationship tension |
| **Information** | 25% | Plot revelations, world-building delivery |
| **Stakes** | 20% | Consequences of scene outcomes |

### 2.3 Calculating Scene Density

```
Density = (Action × 0.25) + (Emotion × 0.30) + (Information × 0.25) + (Stakes × 0.20)
```

Rate each component 1-5, multiply by weight, sum for total (range: 1.0 - 5.0).

## PART III: PACING PATTERNS

### 3.1 Micro Pacing (Scene-to-Scene)

**Rule of Contrast:**
Never place two scenes of the same intensity level consecutively unless deliberate escalation or de-escalation.

**Acceptable Patterns:**
- 3 → 2 → 4 → 2 (wave pattern)
- 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (escalation to climax)
- 5 → 2 → 1 → 2 (recovery from peak)
- 2 → 2 → 2 → 4 (building tension through restraint)

**Forbidden Patterns:**
- 5 → 5 → 5 (exhaustion)
- 1 → 1 → 1 → 1 (boredom)
- 5 → 1 → 5 → 1 (whiplash)

### 3.2 Chapter Pacing

**Standard Chapter Shape:**
```
Opening: Level 2-3 (engagement hook)
Development: Level 2-4 (rising action)
Peak: Level 3-5 (chapter climax)
Resolution: Level 1-2 (setup for next)
```

**Chapter Density Range:**
- Chapters should average 2.5-3.5 density
- No chapter should average below 2.0 or above 4.0

### 3.3 Arc Pacing

**Arc Structure (Macro):**
```
Act I (25%): Introduction, density 2.0-2.5
Act II (50%): Development, density 2.5-3.5
Act III (25%): Climax/Resolution, density 3.5-4.5 → 2.0
```

## PART IV: SON OF COSMOS APPLICATION

### 4.1 Phase I Density Profile (Year 1-3)

**Genre:** Slice-of-life with mystery undertones
**Base Density:** 2.0-3.0
**Peaks:** Rare, significant when they occur

| Period | Average Density | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Days 1-7 | 3.0-3.5 | Establishment, identity processing |
| Days 8-28 | 2.0-2.5 | Routine formation, found family |
| Months 2-6 | 2.0-2.5 | Deepening relationships |
| Year 1 End | 3.0 spike | Anniversary reflection |
| Years 2-3 | 2.0-3.0 | Steady development |

### 4.2 Phase II Density Profile (Year 4-12)

**Genre:** Domestic drama with building tension
**Base Density:** 2.5-3.5
**Peaks:** Moderate, relationship-focused

| Period | Average Density | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Year 4 (Gap C) | 3.5-4.0 | Revelation arc |
| Years 5-12 | 2.5-3.0 | "Quiet years" maintenance |

### 4.3 Phase III Density Profile (Year 13+)

**Genre:** Action-adventure with found family core
**Base Density:** 3.0-4.0
**Peaks:** Frequent, canon events

| Period | Average Density | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Ryoko Release | 4.5-5.0 | Major canon event |
| Post-Ryoko Adjustment | 2.5-3.5 | Recovery, new normal |
| Canon Arrivals | 3.5-4.5 | Each new character |

## PART V: INTENSITY MANAGEMENT

### 5.1 After Peak Intensity (Level 5)

**Mandatory Recovery:**
- Next scene: Level 1-2
- Following 2-3 scenes: No higher than Level 3
- Minimum recovery period: 3 scenes before next peak

**Recovery Scene Types:**
- Domestic task (cooking, cleaning, gardening)
- Quiet conversation (low stakes)
- Nature observation
- Physical rest/sleep
- Comfort food preparation

### 5.2 Building to Peak

**Escalation Protocol:**
- 4+ scenes before climax: Stay at Level 2-3
- 2-3 scenes before: Allow Level 3-4
- Immediately before: Level 4 (tension building)
- Climax: Level 5
- Immediately after: Level 2 (breathing room)

### 5.3 Sustained Tension (Without Exhaustion)

For extended tense sequences:
- Vary density 3-4-3-4 rather than 4-4-4-4
- Include micro-relief moments (brief humor, beauty)
- Break action with character reaction beats
- Use environmental details for momentary rest

## PART VI: GENRE BLEND MANAGEMENT

### 6.1 Son of Cosmos Genre Mix

| Genre | Weight | Intensity Profile |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Slice-of-life | 40% | Density 1-2 |
| Found family drama | 30% | Density 2-4 |
| Mystery/revelation | 15% | Density 3-4 |
| Action/adventure | 15% | Density 4-5 |

### 6.2 Genre Transition Smoothing

When shifting between genres within a scene:
1. Use transitional paragraph as buffer
2. Shift through setting change or time skip
3. Signal genre shift through POV focus change
4. Allow 1-2 paragraphs at intermediate intensity

**Example:**
Slice-of-life (cooking) → Action (Ryoko appears)
- Cooking at Level 2
- Transition: "The kitchen window exploded inward."
- Brief Level 4 shock reaction
- Full Level 5 action sequence
