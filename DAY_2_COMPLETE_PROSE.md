## SCENE 1: WAKING
**Time:** 05:48:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The uguisu woke him.

Three notes ascending in the gray light—*ho-hokekyo*—the Japanese bush warbler announcing dawn to anyone who would listen. He lay still beneath the futon covers, orienting himself to consciousness in stages. Ceiling beams above. Cedar scent. The soft cotton of the yukata Katsuhito had provided, still wrapped around him from the night before.

Day two. He was still here. Still alive, still embodied, still impossibly present in a life that shouldn't be his.

The dream lingered. His grandmother's kitchen—yellow light through gingham curtains, the smell of biscuits baking, her voice carrying the particular warmth reserved for wayward grandchildren. *You always were too stubborn to stay dead.* The words echoed in his waking mind with a clarity that suggested more than ordinary dreaming.

Dorothy Mae had died in 2019. He had died in 2025. Neither of them should be speaking to anyone.

He sat up slowly. The room remained dim, sunrise not yet complete, but enough light filtered through the shoji screens to show him the space he'd slept in. Six tatami mats. A low chest of drawers against one wall. The closet where he'd found the futon. The paper lantern from last night sat on the floor near the door, its candle burned to a stub.

The emptiness felt appropriate. He was starting from nothing. Why shouldn't his surroundings match?

---

## SCENE 2: MORNING INVENTORY
**Time:** 05:55:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

His body demanded attention.

Bladder first—the universal morning priority that transcended death and resurrection. He pushed back the covers and stood, the yukata shifting around his frame. The motion came easy in ways that still startled him. No stiffness. No protest from joints that should have complained after a night on the floor. The body he'd been given operated without the accumulated grievances his previous one had carried.

The toilet was a traditional Japanese squat style, located in a small room off the engawa. He'd figured out the mechanics the night before through trial and observation: remove slippers at the door, use the dedicated toilet slippers inside, face the door rather than the wall. Unfamiliar but not impossible.

Cold water from the tap. No hot water heater in this house—another item for whatever list he would eventually need to make. He splashed his face, the shock clarifying the last traces of sleep and dream from his thoughts.

The mirror above the small sink showed him again what he'd seen at the shrine bathhouse. Half-Japanese features, though the exact proportions remained difficult for him to categorize. Black hair with a natural wave. Eyes that caught the morning light with the silver flecks he'd noticed yesterday—still present, still peripheral, still vanishing when examined directly.

He tested the observation. Looked away, caught them in his peripheral vision. Looked back, watched them fade into the dark iris like stars overwhelmed by sunrise. The pattern held. Whatever they were, they followed consistent rules.

He filed the observation away. Another mystery for a collection that already threatened to overwhelm him.

---

## SCENE 3: CLOTHING PROBLEM
**Time:** 06:05:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The yukata wouldn't work for a day's activities.

He stood in the main room, considering his options. The clothes he'd awakened in yesterday—dress shirt, slacks, the formal attire of a Japanese professional—hung over the back of a chair where he'd draped them after bathing at the shrine. They'd been worn for one impossible day of walking, climbing, sweating. Not dirty exactly, but not fresh either.

He had nothing else. The house held no clothing that fit him—he'd checked the night before. His wallet held money, but the village had no stores that would be open at this hour, and he had no idea what sizes this body required.

The dress shirt would have to serve. He changed from yukata to yesterday's clothes, the fabric carrying the faint memory of chrysanthemum fields and shrine dust. The shirt could be tucked more neatly. The pants had survived the day without obvious damage.

He looked like a man whose wardrobe consisted of one outfit. Which was exactly what he was.

*Seven o'clock*, Katsuhito had said. *Come for breakfast.*

The clock on the wall—mechanical, spring-wound, the kind that would work without electricity—showed 6:08. Fifty-two minutes until he was expected.

---

## SCENE 4: THE VILLAGE SIREN
**Time:** 06:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The siren had sounded while he was changing.

A rising wail from somewhere down the mountain—not an emergency sound, but a sustained tone that felt almost musical in its intention. It held for thirty seconds, then faded into silence. The village wake-up call. Rural Japanese communities using communal signals to structure their days—the knowledge arrived without specific provenance, another fragment of information his benefactor had apparently considered useful.

He moved through the house, cataloging what existed and what didn't. Running water from the well pump worked. The gas lines appeared connected but he wasn't ready to test them without guidance. Electricity functioned in some outlets but not others. The kitchen held nothing edible.

His stomach reminded him of biological requirements. Fifty minutes felt like a long time to wait.

He found the futon still unfolded in the bedroom. The technique for storing it came from somewhere—fold in thirds lengthwise, then in thirds again, creating a compact bundle that fit neatly in the oshiire closet. Storage conventions mattered in traditional houses. He would learn them.

---

## SCENE 5: WALK TO SHRINE
**Time:** 06:48:15 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

The morning air carried the night's residual cool.

He walked the path connecting his house to the shrine residence, the lantern left behind—useless in daylight, but he would need to return it to Katsuhito. Cherry blossoms caught the early light overhead, their petals drifting in the breeze. A few had landed on the path during the night, forming pale constellations against the dark stone.

The stream crossing required attention. The stones were damp with morning dew, his leather shoes not ideal for the passage. He picked his way across carefully, the water running clear and cold beneath.

The shrine grounds opened before him. Smoke rose from the bathhouse chimney—Katsuhito maintaining the traditional rhythms. The main residence showed light in the kitchen window.

He paused at the engawa, removing his shoes and settling them neatly beside the step. The motion felt automatic—muscle memory from a life he hadn't lived, encoded somewhere in his nervous system along with the language and the cultural algorithms.

The door slid open before he could announce himself.

"You're early," Katsuhito said. "Good. You can help prepare."

---

## SCENE 6: BREAKFAST PREPARATION
**Time:** 06:22:15 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The kitchen smelled of rice steam and grilling fish.

Katsuhito stood at the counter, dressed in casual work clothes rather than the priestly robes Sheldon had half-expected. A small mackerel sizzled in a well-seasoned pan. Rice steamed in an electric cooker that looked almost new. The contrast between traditional house and modern appliance struck him as entirely natural.

"You slept well?" Katsuhito asked without turning.

"Better than expected."

"The house accepts you. That helps."

The statement invited questions Sheldon wasn't yet prepared to ask. He let it pass. "Can I assist?"

"The vegetables." Katsuhito gestured toward a cutting board where a small daikon radish and several green onions waited. "Thin slices for the daikon. The green onions, small rounds."

Sheldon found a knife in the drawer indicated and set to work. The blade was sharp, well-maintained, the kind of tool that had been used for decades and respected for every one of them. His hands found their own rhythm—cutting the daikon first into rounds, then into thin half-moons. Dorothy Mae had taught him vegetables. She'd been insistent that a man who couldn't feed himself was half a person.

*Dorothy Mae*. His grandmother. Dead how many years now? The timeline had become confused somewhere between the particle accelerator and the chrysanthemum field. But her lessons remained, encoded deeper than memory.

---

## SCENE 7: TENCHI'S MORNING
**Time:** 06:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, hallway

The small feet approached before the child did.

Pattering steps on the wooden floor, then a pause as someone assessed the kitchen situation from the doorway. Sheldon looked up from his cutting to find Tenchi watching him with the particular intensity children reserved for unexplained phenomena.

"Good morning," Sheldon said.

Tenchi didn't answer immediately. The boy was dressed for the day already—small trousers, a shirt with some cartoon character Sheldon didn't recognize, socks with grips on the soles. His hair stuck up in the back where sleep had compressed it.

"You stayed," Tenchi said finally.

"I did."

"Grandfather said you would."

"Your grandfather was right."

This seemed to satisfy something in the boy's internal calculations. He nodded once, then padded past Sheldon to take his seat at the low table in the dining area. The movement had the quality of established ritual—this was his spot, his morning position, his place in the order of things.

Katsuhito caught Sheldon's eye and smiled slightly. *Children know*, the expression seemed to say. *They always know.*

---

## SCENE 8: BREAKFAST
**Time:** 06:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

The meal assembled itself in stages.

Rice in individual bowls. Miso soup with the daikon and tofu—Sheldon's cutting evident in each spoonful. The grilled mackerel divided between three plates. Pickled vegetables from jars Sheldon hadn't noticed. A small omelet, golden and perfect, that Katsuhito produced from some hidden stage of his preparation.

*Ichiju sansai*. One soup, three dishes. The classical breakfast pattern, executed without apparent effort.

They ate in a silence that felt comfortable rather than strained. Tenchi applied himself to his rice with the focused determination of the very young. Katsuhito consumed his portions with the unhurried pace of someone who had eaten ten thousand such meals and would eat ten thousand more. Sheldon found himself matching both rhythms, adjusting his own tempo to the household cadence.

The food was simple and extraordinary. Each element distinct, each flavor clear. The rice had been prepared perfectly—individual grains that held together without becoming paste. The miso carried notes he couldn't identify but found himself craving by the second spoonful.

"The vegetables," Katsuhito said. "You have skill."

"My grandmother taught me."

"She taught you well."

Sheldon accepted the compliment without elaborating. Some things didn't require explanation.

---

## SCENE 9: TENCHI'S QUESTIONS
**Time:** 07:02:18 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"Do you have a house?" Tenchi asked.

The question arrived between bites of omelet, delivered with the casual directness children deployed when adults had grown too quiet.

"I do," Sheldon said. "The Tsukino house, down the path."

"The empty one?"

"It won't be empty anymore."

Tenchi considered this. "Are you going to fix it?"

The question caught Sheldon unprepared. He hadn't articulated any plans yet, hadn't moved past the immediate reality of having a place to sleep and food to eat. But the boy's expectation hung in the air, requiring an answer.

"Yes," he said. "I'm going to fix it."

"Can I help?"

Sheldon glanced at Katsuhito, uncertain of the appropriate response. The old man's expression remained neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging.

"When you're not in school," Sheldon said carefully. "And when your grandfather says it's acceptable."

"Tenchi begins kindergarten this month," Katsuhito said. "His schedule will be limited."

"Then when he's available."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied with this arrangement. He returned to his breakfast with renewed interest, the negotiation complete.

---

## SCENE 10: DISHES AND ROUTINE
**Time:** 07:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

Sheldon washed. Katsuhito dried.

The rhythm established itself without discussion—plates first, then bowls, then cups, each item rinsed and passed along the small counter. The water came hot from a gas heater that clicked and hummed beneath the sink. Modern convenience layered over traditional structure.

"Today," Katsuhito said, "we will examine your house properly."

"I was hoping you would offer."

"You could have asked."

"I didn't want to presume."

Katsuhito placed a dried bowl in its designated cabinet with the precision of long practice. "You are new here. Presumption is expected. Within reason."

"What constitutes reason?"

The question earned something that might have been a smile. "You will learn. Everyone does."

Tenchi appeared in the kitchen doorway, dressed now in what looked like kindergarten preparation—a small backpack, outdoor shoes in hand. "Grandfather, I'm ready."

"So I see." Katsuhito handed the dish towel to Sheldon with casual delegation. "Walk with me to the village. After, we examine the house."

---

## SCENE 11: WALKING TENCHI TO THE VILLAGE
**Time:** 07:28:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps (descending)

Three hundred twenty steps.

Sheldon counted without intending to, each stone passing beneath his feet as they descended toward the village below. Katsuhito walked ahead, his pace measured to Tenchi's shorter stride. The boy managed the steps with the confidence of someone who had climbed them since he could walk.

The morning light had strengthened, casting long shadows across the mountain path. Cherry blossoms continued their slow snowfall on either side. A stone lantern marked the halfway point, its base moss-covered, its lamp section empty.

"The shrine festival is next week," Katsuhito said without looking back. "You may attend if you wish."

"I'd like that."

"It's not elaborate. Our village is small. But we honor the traditions."

The steps continued downward, curving around the mountain's contour. Sheldon's legs felt nothing like the burning he remembered from the previous day's ascent. His body had recovered completely overnight, or perhaps it had never been truly taxed. The physics of his new existence remained opaque.

At the base of the steps, a small road led toward the village proper. Houses became visible through the trees—traditional structures with tile roofs, farm buildings with corrugated metal, the occasional modern construction that stood out like a misplaced word.

"The kindergarten is this way," Katsuhito said, turning left. "Three hundred meters."

---

## SCENE 12: KINDERGARTEN DROP-OFF
**Time:** 07:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Village kindergarten entrance

The building was low and colorful.

Primary yellows and blues marked the fence and doorways, a deliberate cheerfulness that contrasted with the muted tones of the surrounding village. Children's voices carried from inside—the high-pitched chaos of many small people in enclosed space.

A woman in a pink apron emerged as they approached. Middle-aged, her face arranged in professional welcome. "Masaki-san. Good morning."

"Yamamoto-sensei. Good morning." Katsuhito placed a gentle hand on Tenchi's shoulder. "He's ready for today."

"And who is this?" The teacher's attention shifted to Sheldon with undisguised curiosity.

"Tsukino Sheldon. A relative. He'll be staying at the old house."

"Tsukino?" Recognition flickered across her features. "Oh. Oh, I see. Welcome to our village, Tsukino-san."

"Thank you." Sheldon offered a slight bow. "I apologize for any inconvenience my arrival may cause."

The formality seemed to satisfy her. She nodded, turning her attention back to Tenchi. "Come along then. Hayashi-kun brought tadpoles today. Everyone's very excited."

Tenchi glanced back once as the teacher led him inside. Sheldon raised a hand in acknowledgment—not quite a wave, just recognition. The boy disappeared through the colorful doors.

"She knows the house," Katsuhito said quietly.

"Most people in the village do?"

"It's been empty for three years. People notice empty houses. They wonder."

"And now they'll have answers."

"Some answers. The rest they'll invent." Katsuhito turned back toward the shrine steps. "This is how villages work."

---

## SCENE 13: THE RETURN CLIMB
**Time:** 07:58:15 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps (ascending)

The three hundred twenty steps felt different going up.

Not harder—his body still refused to register exertion the way it should—but different in texture. Each stone familiar now, the sequence burned into muscle memory after only one round trip. The moss patches, the uneven landings, the places where roots had shifted the path over decades.

"You don't struggle," Katsuhito observed.

"Should I?"

"Most visitors do. The steps are intentionally challenging."

"I noticed that yesterday."

"Yet today you climb without breathing heavily."

Sheldon didn't have an answer. The observation was accurate, and denying it would be foolish. "My body is different than it was."

"Different how?"

"Better. Faster to recover. Stronger than I remember being." He paused on a landing, not from fatigue but to meet Katsuhito's eyes. "I don't know why. I don't know how. But I'm not going to pretend it isn't true."

The old man studied him for a long moment. Something passed through his expression—assessment, perhaps, or recognition of a familiar quality Sheldon couldn't identify.

"Honesty," Katsuhito said finally. "That's rare."

"It seems like the only option."

"It usually is. People just don't realize it."

They continued climbing. The conversation had shifted something, though Sheldon couldn't have named what. An understanding, perhaps. Or the beginning of one.

---

## SCENE 14: PREPARATION FOR THE HOUSE VISIT
**Time:** 08:25:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

Katsuhito gathered supplies.

A flashlight, despite the morning hour. A small notebook and pencil. A folding knife that looked older than Sheldon felt. Work gloves that had seen many seasons of use. He placed each item in a worn leather bag with the efficiency of long habit.

Then he paused, regarding Sheldon's clothing with the neutral assessment of someone who dealt in practical matters.

"You cannot inspect a house in those." The observation carried no judgment. "Come."

A side room held storage Sheldon hadn't seen before—cedar chests, wrapped bundles, the accumulated possessions of a household that had existed for generations. Katsuhito retrieved a folded stack from one chest.

"My son's. From before he moved to the city." He set the stack on the nearest surface. "He won't miss them."

Heavy work pants with reinforced knees, worn but solid. A long-sleeved shirt in faded blue. A light jacket suited for spring mornings. Socks. A headband for keeping sweat from eyes during labor. Even a pair of worn tabi boots that looked approximately the right size.

"I can't—"

"You can. The house needs inspection. Inspection requires appropriate clothing. This is not charity. This is preparation."

The distinction mattered, Sheldon realized. Katsuhito was framing the gift as practical necessity rather than generosity—allowing acceptance without the burden of excessive gratitude.

"Thank you."

"Change quickly. The house won't examine itself."

---

## SCENE 14B: PROPER ATTIRE
**Time:** 08:32:17 JST  
**Location:** Main House, side room

The clothes fit.

Not perfectly—the pants rode slightly high, the shirt was loose through the shoulders—but well enough for work that would involve crawling, climbing, and the kind of physical labor that didn't require tailored precision. His formal field clothes remained folded on a chair, waiting for occasions that warranted their use.

He examined himself in the small mirror by the door. A different man looked back. The dress shirt and slacks had suggested professional origins, educated displacement. The work clothes suggested belonging. Someone who lived here. Someone who could do what needed doing.

*Clothes make the man*. His mother's voice, or perhaps his grandmother's. The saying carried different weight now.

---

## SCENE 15: SUPPLIES COMPLETE
**Time:** 08:38:44 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

Katsuhito approved the transformation with a slight nod.

He added the work gloves to the bag along with the flashlight, notebook, and knife. "The house has been unoccupied for three years," he said. "There will be damage we cannot see from outside."

"You've been inside during that time?"

"Occasionally. To ensure the structure remained sound and the roof didn't fail catastrophically." A pause. "It has not failed catastrophically."

"That's... reassuring?"

"It should be. Catastrophic failure would require rebuilding rather than repair. Repair is manageable. Rebuilding is expensive."

The distinction landed with practical weight. Sheldon had money—the bankbooks showed balances he couldn't quite reconcile with any life he remembered—but he had no sense of what things cost here, what labor was worth, what materials required.

"I know nothing about Japanese construction," he admitted.

"Then you will learn. Everyone does."

---

## SCENE 16: THE PATH TO TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 08:50:22 JST  
**Location:** Path from shrine to Tsukino House

The house wasn't visible from the main shrine grounds.

The path descended first, curving around a stand of old cedar that blocked the sightline. Stone underfoot gave way to packed earth, then to a wooden bridge over a small stream that Sheldon hadn't noticed the previous evening. Cherry trees lined both sides, their branches meeting overhead to form a tunnel of pink and white.

"Your family planted these," Katsuhito said. "Fifty years ago, perhaps more."

"The Tsukinos?"

"Your mother's family. Three generations lived in that house before the last occupant passed."

Sheldon absorbed this. His documented history—the one his benefactor had constructed—included parents and grandparents, a family tree extending back through the generations. But knowing facts differed from *knowing* them, feeling the weight of accumulated lives that had walked this same path.

"Who was the last occupant?"

"Your great-aunt. Tsukino Etsuko. She died at ninety-three, in her sleep, in the house where she was born."

"A good death."

"She would have agreed."

The path straightened, and there it was.

---

## SCENE 16: FIRST FULL VIEW OF THE HOUSE
**Time:** 08:48:33 JST  
**Location:** Clearing before Tsukino House

*Melancholy but not ruined.*

The phrase arrived fully formed as Sheldon took in the structure before him. Two stories of traditional Japanese construction, the lower level larger than the upper. Tile roof that sagged slightly in one corner but hadn't collapsed. Wooden exterior weathered to silver-gray, the color of old bones left to the elements.

Windows shuttered. Engawa running along two sides, its planks visible even from here. A small garden in front, overgrown but not wild—plants that had been deliberately placed, now competing with whatever seeds the wind had carried.

The morning light caught the roof tiles at an angle that revealed their age. Some had cracked. Some had shifted from their original positions. But they remained, doing their fundamental job of keeping water out of the space below.

"It's beautiful," Sheldon said.

Katsuhito glanced at him. "Most people see the decay first."

"I see that too. But underneath—the bones are good."

"You understand buildings?"

"No." Sheldon stepped closer, his eyes tracing the roofline, the wall joints, the foundation stones visible along the perimeter. "But I understand systems. How things connect. How failure cascades from small problems to large ones if you don't intervene."

"That's a physicist's view."

"It's the only view I have."

---

## SCENE 17: EXTERIOR EXAMINATION
**Time:** 08:55:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior circuit

They walked the perimeter slowly.

Katsuhito pointed out features Sheldon wouldn't have known to look for: the stone foundation, dry-laid without mortar, that had settled unevenly on the western corner. The engawa boards that had rotted where drainage from the roof concentrated. The window shutters that hung at angles suggesting damaged hinges rather than careful closure.

"The roof is your priority," Katsuhito said. "Everything else follows from whether water enters the house."

"The tiles I saw from the front—some are displaced."

"More than some. The northwest section took damage in a storm two winters ago. Temporary repairs were made."

"By whom?"

"Myself. The village carpenter was too busy to attend an empty house."

The information landed with unexpected weight. This man—barely known, owing nothing—had climbed onto a stranger's abandoned house in winter to patch a roof that protected no one.

"Why?" Sheldon asked.

"Tsukino Etsuko was my friend. Her house deserved better than rot." A pause. "And the documents suggested someone would come."

"Documents?"

"Your great-aunt left instructions with the shrine. In the event of her death, certain materials were to be kept for a claimant." Katsuhito met his eyes. "You are that claimant."

---

## SCENE 18: ENTERING THE HOUSE
**Time:** 09:12:08 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, genkan

The front door resisted, then surrendered.

Wood swollen from humidity, Katsuhito explained as he applied careful pressure to the handle. The door wasn't locked—there was nothing here worth stealing, and the village didn't lock doors regardless. But time and weather had made their own barriers.

The smell hit first. Dust and cedar, mold and something else—age, perhaps, or simple emptiness. The scent of a space that had forgotten what occupation felt like.

The genkan was small, three steps leading up to the main floor level. Shoe storage built into the wall on one side. A faded ukiyo-e print on the other, too damaged by time to identify its subject.

"Leave your shoes," Katsuhito said unnecessarily. Sheldon had already begun removing them.

The floor above the entrance felt solid under his feet. Tatami in the first visible room, aged but intact. Dust covered every horizontal surface with the uniform gray of undisturbed years.

His house. These were his floors, his walls, his tatami mats settling under his weight.

The reality hadn't landed fully until this moment.

---

## SCENE 19: THE MAIN ROOM
**Time:** 09:18:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

Six tatami mats.

A tokonoma alcove along one wall, empty now of any display. Fusuma sliding doors leading to adjacent spaces, their paper panels yellowed but unbroken. A low table in the center, covered by a dusty cloth that had probably been white once.

The ceiling caught Sheldon's attention. Dark wood beams crossing at regular intervals, the exposed structure of a building that didn't pretend to be anything other than assembled pieces. And in one corner—staining. Brown marks that radiated from a central point, the unmistakable evidence of water intrusion.

"There," Katsuhito said, following his gaze. "The roof damage."

"It's been here for two winters?"

"The temporary repair stopped active leaking. But the stain remains, and the wood may be compromised."

Sheldon crossed to stand beneath the discoloration. The boards above showed no visible sagging, no indication that structural failure was imminent. But appearance deceived. Problems hid inside walls and beneath surfaces, waiting for the right moment to reveal themselves.

"I need to access the roof from inside," he said. "Check the extent."

"There's an access in the closet. We'll examine it."

---

## SCENE 20: CATALOGING DAMAGE
**Time:** 09:25:18 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, throughout

Katsuhito took notes. Sheldon explored.

Room by room, they documented the house's condition—a systematic inventory of what worked, what didn't, and what existed in the uncertain space between.

**Kitchen**: Stone sink, cracked but functional. Gas stove, disconnected. Cupboards holding dishes that had been washed and stored by hands now three years in the ground. A window above the sink, facing east, admitting morning light through glass that needed cleaning.

**Bedroom** (rear): The space where his futon now waited. Closet containing bedding that Katsuhito must have aired recently—the fabric smelled of sun rather than must. A small bureau, empty.

**Second room** (adjacent to main): Eight tatami mats, slightly larger. This had been the formal guest space, Katsuhito said—the room for receiving visitors, for ceremonies, for the important moments of family life. A kamidana home altar remained on one wall, empty of offerings.

**Toilet**: Traditional squat style, as Sheldon had discovered. Functioning, though the wood floor showed soft spots near the door.

**Bath area**: No actual bathing space. The house had relied on the village bathhouse, apparently, or heated water manually for washing in the kitchen. Another item for the list.

**Upper floor**: Accessed by a steep staircase that creaked at every step. Two rooms, smaller than those below. Storage, primarily—boxes and trunks that had accumulated over decades of family life. A window at each end providing cross-ventilation. And the roof access, a hinged panel in the ceiling of the smaller room.

---

## SCENE 21: ROOF ACCESS
**Time:** 09:48:55 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, upper floor storage room

The ladder was older than the house.

Wooden rungs worn smooth by many hands, the uprights secured to the wall with iron brackets that had rusted but held. Katsuhito positioned the flashlight to illuminate the access panel, then stepped back.

"You should see this yourself," he said. "I can describe what I found, but eyes matter more than words."

Sheldon climbed. The rungs supported his weight without complaint—another testament to construction methods that built for centuries rather than decades. The access panel lifted easily, revealing the crawlspace between ceiling and roof.

Darkness. Then, as his eyes adjusted and the flashlight beam swept the space: structure revealed.

Rafters running at regular intervals. Cross-bracing where it should be. And in the northwest section—light. Actual daylight, where the temporary repairs Katsuhito had made didn't quite seal the gap between tiles.

"I see it," Sheldon called down.

"The extent?"

He crawled forward carefully, testing each rafter before committing his weight. The damage was worse than the stain below suggested. Three rafters showed dark discoloration where water had soaked them repeatedly. One had begun to soften at its joint with the ridge beam—not failed, not yet, but compromised.

"The wood is damaged," he said. "At least one rafter needs replacement. Maybe two."

"Ah." The syllable contained no surprise. "This is what I feared."

---

## SCENE 22: THE ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 10:02:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

They sat across from each other, the dusty table between them.

Katsuhito's notebook lay open, filled with observations in characters Sheldon could read but not have produced himself. The inventory of damage was substantial but not overwhelming. The house needed work—serious work—but it wasn't beyond saving.

"Roof first," Katsuhito said. "Without a sound roof, nothing else matters."

"Agreed."

"The damaged rafters require replacement. This means opening the roof, removing tiles, installing new wood, then re-tiling. It is not a one-person task."

"I assumed I'd need help."

"The village carpenter, Yamada Kenji, handles such work. He is... thorough. Also skeptical of outsiders."

"Will he work with me?"

Katsuhito considered the question with visible care. "Possibly. If you approach correctly."

"What does correctly mean?"

"Humility. Willingness to learn. Acknowledgment that you know nothing about his craft and seek his expertise rather than merely his labor." A pause. "Also, you should offer to work alongside him. Not supervise. Assist."

"I wasn't planning to supervise."

"Good. Some city people assume."

---

## SCENE 23: FINDING ETSUKO'S TREASURES
**Time:** 10:18:44 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room closet

The closet contained more than futons.

Katsuhito had mentioned storage, but Sheldon hadn't explored beyond retrieving his bedding the night before. Now, with the house assessment paused for planning, curiosity drew him to the deeper recesses.

Boxes first. Wooden crates, some with characters carved or painted on the sides indicating contents—*dishes*, *linens*, *seasonal decorations*. These had been packed by someone who expected to unpack them again, or expected someone else to find them comprehensible.

Behind the boxes, a wrapped bundle. Cloth secured with string, the fabric faded from what had once been deep blue. He lifted it carefully—heavier than expected—and brought it into the main room's light.

"May I?" He looked to Katsuhito for permission he probably didn't need.

"It's yours."

The string came apart in his hands, brittle with age. The cloth unfolded to reveal—photographs. Dozens of them, some mounted on card stock in the old style, others loose. Faces looked up at him from across decades.

A young woman in a formal kimono, her expression serious but her eyes bright. The same woman older, surrounded by children who might have been nieces, nephews, grandchildren. A man who shared her facial structure, standing before this very house when its wood was dark rather than silver, its garden trimmed rather than wild.

"Etsuko?" Sheldon asked, indicating the woman.

"Yes. In her twenties in that first image. Perhaps nineteen-twenty." Katsuhito pointed to another photograph. "And here, her brother. Your... let me calculate. Great-great-uncle? The family tree becomes complicated."

"My mother's side."

"Yes. The Tsukinos. A small family, always. Few children each generation. But they persisted."

Sheldon held the photographs with hands that wanted to tremble. These were his people—not by birth, not by any truth he understood, but by the documentation that defined identity in this world. Whatever his benefactor had done, whoever she was, she had placed him in the middle of this story. These faces belonged to him now.

"I should display these," he said. "When the house is ready."

"Etsuko would have wanted that."

## SCENE 24: THE STORAGE DISCOVERY
**Time:** 10:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, upper floor storage

The trunks called to him.

Practical concerns—roof repairs, damaged wood, empty kitchen—should have commanded his attention. But the photographs had awakened something, a hunger for context that wouldn't be denied. He climbed the narrow stairs again, this time with intent.

The larger trunk opened with a creak of hinges that hadn't moved in years. Inside: fabric. Kimono, folded with the precise care of someone who understood their value. He recognized the layers—kosode base, obi sashes, accessories whose names he didn't know but whose functions seemed clear.

Festival clothing, perhaps. Or formal wear kept for special occasions. The colors remained vivid despite their storage—deep reds, forest greens, a midnight blue that caught the light from the window.

He closed the trunk without disturbing the contents further. These weren't his to touch yet. The house needed to be ready first—aired out, cleaned, made worthy of the treasures it contained.

The smaller trunk beside it held papers. Documents in the formal script of official transactions, dates stretching back decades. Property transfers, tax receipts, correspondence with government offices. The bureaucratic archaeology of a family's existence.

And at the bottom, wrapped in oiled cloth: a deed.

The same deed he carried in his wallet—no. An older version. The same property, the same description, but different names in the ownership section. Transfer from grandfather to grandmother, then to aunt, then... blank. A space where his name should be, or whoever's name Etsuko had expected to claim this house.

"You found it," Katsuhito said from the stairway. He'd climbed silently, or Sheldon had been too absorbed to hear.

"The deed."

"Etsuko left it there deliberately. She said the right person would know where to look."

"Did she know who that would be?"

"She believed she did." Katsuhito's expression carried something—sorrow, perhaps, or the weight of promises kept beyond death. "Whether her belief was accurate... I cannot say. But you are here. You hold the deed. The house is yours."

---

## SCENE 25: RETURN TO MAIN HOUSE
**Time:** 11:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and shrine

The return walk felt different.

The house sat behind them now, real in ways it hadn't been the day before. Sheldon had walked its floors, breathed its air, touched the photographs of people whose blood he didn't share but whose name he carried. The weight of inheritance settled on his shoulders with every step.

"The roof," he said as they walked. "How do I approach Yamada?"

"I will introduce you. Tomorrow, perhaps. Today you should rest and think."

"I've rested enough."

Katsuhito's glance carried amusement. "You've been alive for two days. Rest is not a luxury you can afford to ignore."

The reminder landed strangely. Two days. Forty-eight hours, approximately, since he'd opened his eyes in the chrysanthemum field. The time felt longer, compressed and stretched simultaneously by the density of new experience.

"How does anyone process this much change this quickly?" he asked.

"They don't. Not fully. The mind takes what it can and stores the rest for later. You'll be unpacking these days for months."

"That's comforting and disturbing simultaneously."

"Welcome to life. Most of it is both."

---

## SCENE 26: LUNCH PREPARATION
**Time:** 11:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The noon siren caught them mid-preparation.

Another sustained tone from the village below, marking the lunch hour with the same communal efficiency as the morning wake-up. Sheldon had been washing vegetables again—the rhythm of kitchen work providing anchor points his thoughts could organize around.

"Tenchi returns at two," Katsuhito said. "Kindergarten days are short."

"Should I collect him?"

"Today, no. Nobuyuki arranged early pickup—he's visiting this weekend for the birthday. Tenchi will be excited."

"The birthday?"

"Next week. Tenchi turns five." Katsuhito added rice to the cooker with measured precision. "You'll be invited, naturally. Family occasions include family."

The word *family* resonated strangely. Sheldon had been granted a family history, documented relatives extending back generations. But the living family—the people who occupied these spaces and breathed this air—remained new. He'd known Tenchi less than a day. Katsuhito, barely longer.

"I'd be honored to attend," he said.

"Good. Tenchi has been asking about you, apparently. The teacher mentioned."

"What has he been saying?"

"That a new uncle arrived. That you stayed. That you're going to fix the broken house." Katsuhito's smile was gentle. "Children simplify. But they also distill to essence."

---

## SCENE 27: LUNCH
**Time:** 12:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Rice, pickles, miso soup with different vegetables than breakfast.

The pattern repeated but varied, a theme with variations that Sheldon recognized from his own cooking education. You didn't serve the same meal twice; you served the same structure with different contents. The rice remained constant. Everything else responded to ingredient availability and seasonal appropriateness.

"April vegetables," Katsuhito said, noting Sheldon's attention to the soup contents. "The spring harvest begins. Farmers bring what they can spare to the shrine."

"In exchange for?"

"Blessings, formally. Informally, they bring excess because the shrine has always received their excess, and tradition weighs more than transaction."

The economics of rural shrine life opened another window onto this world. Katsuhito wasn't wealthy—the house's modest scale, the practical quality of every item, made that clear. But he wasn't struggling either. The community supported the shrine, and the shrine supported the community. A closed loop with its own logic.

"Do you grow anything yourself?" Sheldon asked.

"A small garden. Herbs primarily. Some vegetables in summer." A pause. "Etsuko's garden was more substantial. She supplied half the shrine's needs."

"The Tsukino house garden."

"Yes. It will need reclamation before it can produce again."

Another item for the list. Roof, utilities, living space, garden. The scope expanded with each conversation, each new piece of information revealing connections to other pieces.

---

## SCENE 28: AFTERNOON REST
**Time:** 13:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

Katsuhito had insisted.

"Rest. Your body may not feel fatigue, but your mind is not exempt. Sit with what you've learned. The house will still need repair tomorrow."

So Sheldon sat in his own house, in the main room with its water-stained ceiling and dust-furred surfaces, and let his thoughts unspool.

The photographs lay spread across the table now, arranged in rough chronological order. Etsuko's face tracked through decades—young woman to old woman, always with the same essential expression. Serious but bright. Present but looking toward horizons only she could see.

She'd expected someone to come. Katsuhito had said so. The deed, the photographs, the house maintained enough to survive—preparations for a claimant she'd never met.

*Did she know it would be me?*

Impossible. He hadn't existed in this timeline until two days ago. Whatever his benefactor had done, whatever retroactive insertion had occurred, Etsuko couldn't have known details that hadn't yet been written.

But perhaps she'd known *something*. A shape in the possibilities. A sense that the Tsukino house would find its person.

He looked at the walls around him. Water stains. Aging paper. Dust that marked neglect. But also bones that had stood for generations, walls that had sheltered his documented family through war and peace and every season between.

The house had waited. And now he was here.

---

## SCENE 29: TENCHI'S RETURN
**Time:** 14:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

The sound of car doors announced the arrival.

Sheldon had been reading—a book from Katsuhito's modest library, selected for its approachable vocabulary—on the engawa overlooking the shrine grounds. The afternoon had grown warm enough to sit comfortably in the shade, spring asserting itself over the morning's chill.

A vehicle he didn't recognize was parked at the shrine's entrance. Two figures approached: Tenchi, his small backpack bouncing with each step, and a man in his apparent forties whose face carried resemblance to both the old priest and the young boy.

Nobuyuki. The father. The architect who worked in Kurashiki and visited weekends.

Sheldon stood as they reached the engawa. Tenchi ran the last few meters, his kindergarten decorum abandoned in favor of enthusiasm.

"Sheldon-san! You stayed!"

"I said I would."

"I know. But sometimes people say and don't." The child's logic was irrefutable. Sheldon filed away the observation about trust and promises for future reference.

Nobuyuki climbed the engawa steps more slowly, his eyes assessing the stranger his son had befriended. "Tsukino-san. Father mentioned you arrived."

"Yesterday. I apologize for any disruption to your family."

"No disruption." The words were polite but the assessment continued. Nobuyuki was measuring something—character, perhaps, or the nature of Sheldon's intentions. "My father says you're family."

"Distantly. The Tsukino house belonged to my great-aunt."

"Etsuko-san. I remember her." Something shifted in Nobuyuki's expression—tension easing into something softer. "She made the best pickles in the village. My wife used to trade recipes with her."

*Wife.* The word arrived with unexpected weight. Tenchi had a mother somewhere in this story—had had one. The present tense remained ambiguous.

"I hope to honor her memory by restoring the house," Sheldon said carefully.

"That's—" Nobuyuki paused, collecting words. "That's good. It shouldn't stay empty."

---

## SCENE 30: FAMILY DYNAMICS
**Time:** 15:08:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

Tea materialized, as it always seemed to in this household.

Katsuhito presided over the service with his usual economical grace. Tenchi sat beside his father, close enough to touch but maintaining the slight formality of a child who didn't see his parent every day. Nobuyuki's attention divided between his son and the newcomer who had appeared in their midst.

"The house needs substantial work," Katsuhito said, providing context Nobuyuki hadn't asked for but clearly wanted. "The roof especially."

"I saw the temporary repair. Two winters ago?"

"Three now. It held, but barely."

Nobuyuki nodded slowly. "Yamada will need to see it."

"I was planning to introduce them tomorrow," Katsuhito said.

"He'll want to know who's paying."

This was directed at Sheldon. The question within the statement was clear: *Do you have resources, or are you a burden?*

"I have funds," Sheldon said. "The inheritance included bank accounts. I've confirmed access."

"Enough for a roof?"

"I believe so. Though I don't know local costs."

"Yamada's fair. He'll quote what it's worth." Nobuyuki's assessment seemed to pass some threshold. "If you need recommendations for other tradespeople—plumbers, electricians—I know people in the construction industry."

"That would be helpful."

"After the roof. One thing at a time."

---

## SCENE 31: TENCHI'S PROJECT
**Time:** 15:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

"I made this," Tenchi said.

The object in his hands was approximately rectangular. Paper, cut and folded with the irregular precision of small fingers. Colors—blue and green and something that might have been purple—marked its surface in enthusiastic patterns.

"It's for the tadpoles," Tenchi explained. "Hayashi-kun's tadpoles. They need a pond but we can't have a real pond so I made a paper one."

The logic was five-year-old perfect. A pond for creatures that required water, rendered in materials that would dissolve on contact. The gift was in the intention, not the execution.

"It's beautiful," Sheldon said.

"You can see the fish." Tenchi pointed to shapes that could have been fish, or birds, or the abstract expressions of a child who hadn't yet learned to constrain his imagination. "They're happy because they have friends."

"Everyone needs friends."

"Do you have friends?"

The question landed with the blunt force of childhood directness. Sheldon considered his answer carefully.

"I'm making them," he said finally. "Your grandfather. You, I hope. It takes time."

Tenchi nodded, apparently satisfied. "I'll be your friend. Grandfather says you need people."

"Your grandfather is wise."

"I know. He's the wisest." This was stated as fact, beyond any possible debate. "Except maybe the mountain. But the mountain doesn't talk."

---

## SCENE 32: EVENING APPROACH
**Time:** 17:00:15 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The evening siren marked the transition.

Dinner preparations began with the same rhythm as every other meal—rice measured, vegetables selected, protein considered. Tonight included fish again, delivered by a farmer who'd received blessings for his planting season and returned the favor with fresh catch from the river.

"You can cook," Nobuyuki observed. He'd watched Sheldon handle the vegetables without comment until now.

"My grandmother taught me."

"American grandmother?"

"Georgia. The state, not the country."

"Ah." Something in Nobuyuki's stance relaxed. "My wife learned to cook from her mother. Tenchi was too young to learn before—" He stopped. Recalibrated. "I do my best, but it's not the same."

The unfinished sentence hung between them. Tenchi's mother—Nobuyuki's wife—existed in the past tense of memory and absence.

"The shrine provides well," Sheldon said, choosing not to press. "Katsuhito has been generous."

"Father cooks for the mountain as much as for people. He says food given with gratitude receives blessings."

"Is that theology or practice?"

Nobuyuki's smile was unexpected—genuine, reaching his eyes for the first time since arriving. "With Father, they're the same thing."

---

## SCENE 33: DINNER TOGETHER
**Time:** 18:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Four at the table changed the dynamic.

Tenchi demanded attention—recounting his day, describing the tadpoles, explaining the social intricacies of kindergarten with the detail-rich memory of the very young. Nobuyuki listened with the particular focus of a parent cataloging every moment he'd missed by being away.

Katsuhito anchored one end of the table, his presence steady as the mountain on which they lived. Sheldon occupied the fourth position, still guest but becoming less so with every meal shared.

"Tsukino-san fixed the vegetables again," Tenchi announced to his father. "He cuts them good."

"Well," Nobuyuki corrected gently. "He cuts them well."

"That's what I said."

The exchange carried the weight of routine—corrections offered and resisted, language shaped by repetition. Sheldon filed away another data point about this family's inner workings.

"After dinner," Katsuhito said, "we should discuss tomorrow's plans."

"The carpenter?" Sheldon asked.

"And other matters. Nobuyuki brought news from the village."

"News?" Sheldon looked to the younger man.

"The village council meets next week. New residents require... acknowledgment."

The word choice was careful. *Acknowledgment* rather than *approval*. But the implication was clear: Sheldon's presence had been noted, and official structures would want their say.

---

## SCENE 34: AFTER-DINNER DISCUSSION
**Time:** 19:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

Tea again. The rhythm of important conversations.

"The council," Nobuyuki explained, "manages common resources. The bathhouse, the road maintenance, the festival preparations. When someone new moves to the village—which is rare—they want to understand who's arriving."

"Understand how?"

"Your family connection. Your plans. Whether you'll participate in village obligations." Nobuyuki's tone suggested these were the official concerns. His expression suggested others existed that wouldn't be stated.

"They want to know if I'm trustworthy," Sheldon translated.

"Essentially."

"What do I need to do?"

"Attend when they request. Answer questions honestly. Demonstrate that you intend to be a neighbor, not just an occupant." Katsuhito added the final requirement. "And repair Etsuko's house. That will speak louder than anything you say."

The logic was sound. Actions over words. Community membership earned through contribution rather than claimed through residence.

"When is this meeting?"

"Next Thursday. One week from today."

Seven days. The roof wouldn't be fixed by then, but visible progress might be possible. At minimum, he could demonstrate serious intention.

"I'll be there."

---

## SCENE 35: TENCHI'S BEDTIME
**Time:** 19:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, hallway

"Good night, Sheldon-san."

Tenchi stood in the hallway in his sleeping clothes, his father waiting behind with the particular patience of bedtime routines. The boy had already said goodnight to his grandfather—a formal moment with a small bow that carried genuine reverence.

"Good night, Tenchi." Sheldon lowered himself to the child's level. "Sleep well."

"Will you be here tomorrow?"

"I live here now. I'll be here."

"Promise?"

The word carried weight Tenchi couldn't fully understand. Promises to children mattered in ways that adult agreements often didn't—not because adults were less important, but because children remembered betrayals with perfect clarity.

"I promise."

Tenchi nodded. Satisfied, he followed his father toward the bedroom wing.

Sheldon watched them go. Two days in this life, and already he'd bound himself with promises. To a child he'd just met. To a house that needed repair. To a community that hadn't yet decided whether to accept him.

The weight felt appropriate. He'd been given something impossible—life, identity, place. The least he could do was make it mean something.

---

## SCENE 36: EVENING BATH
**Time:** 20:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, bathroom

The bathing order had shifted with Nobuyuki's presence.

Guest first—Sheldon, though his guest status blurred more each day. Then Nobuyuki, as visiting family. Then Katsuhito, who would ensure the fire was properly banked before retiring. Tenchi had bathed earlier, a child's schedule taking precedence over adult ordering.

The water was the same heat as yesterday—40 degrees, perhaps higher. Sheldon washed outside the tub first, the soap-and-rinse ritual that kept the bath clean for subsequent users. Then into the water, letting the heat soak into muscles that didn't ache but somehow still needed this.

He examined his body again in the privacy of the bath. Still no scars. Still that inexplicable sense of *correctness*, as if this body had been designed rather than grown. The silver flecks in his eyes—he'd checked again in the small mirror near the sink—remained present but not more obvious.

Two days. His body had held its new form for two days. Whatever changes might come, they hadn't manifested yet.

---

## SCENE 37: WALK TO TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 20:45:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between Main House and Tsukino House

The night wrapped around him.

Stars again, the dense scatter of rural darkness where light pollution didn't exist to wash them out. The crescent moon had set early, leaving only starlight and the small circle of his borrowed lantern to mark the path.

Cherry blossoms had fallen throughout the day, their petals forming pale drifts against the stone path. In the lantern light, they looked like snow—but warmer, somehow. Evidence of life's passage rather than winter's grip.

The Tsukino house waited at the path's end. No lights—he hadn't yet confirmed the electricity was safe to use, and candles seemed unwise in a structure with a damaged roof. Tomorrow he would address the practical matters. Tonight, he would sleep in his house, in the darkness that had sheltered his family for generations.

---

## SCENE 38: PREPARING FOR SLEEP
**Time:** 21:05:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The futon remembered his shape from the night before.

Perhaps not literally—cotton batting didn't hold memory the way human tissue did—but the motions of unfolding it, spreading it on the tatami, arranging the covers felt natural now. Two nights didn't make a routine, but they suggested one forming.

He lay in the darkness, listening to the house settle around him. Wood creaking as temperature dropped. A distant owl beginning its night's hunt. The sound of his own breathing, steady and measured, the body function he had most direct control over.

Tomorrow: meet the carpenter. Assess what work was possible. Begin the process of earning his place in this community.

Tonight: rest. Let the mind process what it could and store what it couldn't.

The house held him gently. Whether that was metaphor or something else, he couldn't tell. But he slept, and the house watched, and the mountain above them both stood patient against the stars.

---

## SCENE 39: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** During sleep  
**Location:** Dreamscape

Georgia first.

Dorothy Mae's kitchen, the yellow light through gingham curtains, the smell of biscuits and coffee that meant Sunday morning. She moved through the space without seeing him, her hands working dough with the automatic competence of fifty years' practice.

He tried to speak. His mouth wouldn't form words.

*You're doing fine*, she said without turning. *Just keep doing fine.*

The kitchen dissolved. White replaced it—not blankness but light, a space without walls or floor or ceiling. And at the edge of his vision, the same presence he'd sensed before. Tall, slender, patient beyond human measure.

They didn't speak. They didn't need to. The watching carried its own message: *I see you. I will continue seeing you. You are not alone.*

He reached toward the presence. As he did, something in his chest—his heart, or something deeper—resonated like a struck bell.

---

## SCENE 40: SECOND DAWN
**Time:** 05:48:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The uguisu again.

He opened his eyes to find the ceiling beams waiting, patient and familiar. Day three. Still here. Still alive.

The dream lingered at the edges of his awareness—his grandmother's hands, the white space, the watching presence. He didn't try to analyze it. Some things required time to reveal their meanings.

He rose to meet the day.

---
