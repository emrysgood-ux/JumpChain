## MASAKI KATSUHITO POV
## **Week Three: Assessment Deepens**

---

# DAY 15 - APRIL 17, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **Two Weeks Complete**

---

### Summary Assessment

Two weeks since the stranger's arrival. The household had settled into patterns that felt increasingly permanent.

The stranger was not human in any conventional sense. The evidence undeniable:
- Physical capability beyond normal parameters
- Skills manifesting without training
- Adaptation speed exceeding all reasonable metrics
- No fatigue accumulation despite sustained labor

Yet "not human" covered vast territory. Juraian? No—the markers were wrong. Demonic? No malicious resonance. Artificial? No mechanical signature.

Something else. Something outside seven centuries of experience.

### Notable Scenes

## SCENE 001-100 | Morning

The stranger's cooking had achieved a plateau of excellence that showed no sign of declining.

"The miso ratio today is different."

"I adjusted for the season. The warmer weather calls for lighter preparation."

The stranger had intuited seasonal variation in traditional cuisine—knowledge from deep cultural immersion, not academic study.

---

## SCENE 201-299 | Evening

Tenchi's attachment had solidified into something resembling familial bond.

"Sheldon-san, can you help with my picture?"

"What are you drawing?"

"Our house. With everyone in it."

The "everyone" now included the stranger. Two weeks, and he had become part of the child's definition of family.

# DAY 16 - APRIL 18, 1989 (TUESDAY)
## **Roof Damage Discovery**

---

### Summary Assessment

The stranger mentioned the Tsukino house roof.

"I've discovered significant damage. The deterioration is more extensive than the exterior suggested."

The information landed with unexpected weight. Masaru's property—neglected since its owner's death, now claimed by a stranger whose nature remained undefined—faced structural crisis.

"How extensive?"

"The main support beam shows concerning deflection. Multiple leak points have compromised the ceiling structure. Professional assessment seems warranted."

---

### Assessment

The day's character shifted. Observation of a mysterious stranger dealing with genuine crisis.

The response would reveal much.

The stranger's approach demonstrated systematic thinking. Assessment methodical, documentation thorough, conclusions appropriately tentative pending expert evaluation.

# DAY 17 - APRIL 19, 1989 (WEDNESDAY)
## **Yamada Consultation**

---

### Summary Assessment

The stranger returned from village with news: Yamada had recommended a roof specialist from Kurashiki. Nishida—a name Katsuhito recognized from temple restoration work.

"He's expensive but thorough. Yamada spoke highly of his expertise."

"Nishida does good work. The temple in Honmura hired him for their restoration last decade."

"Yamada arranged an introduction. Nishida will assess when his schedule permits."

---

The progress was substantial for a single village trip. The stranger's ability to navigate social systems matched his other capabilities—community connections forming with unusual efficiency.

---

### Notable Scenes

## SCENE 276-299 | Night Reflection

The reference to grandmother was new—a detail from the claimed previous life, offered casually.

"My grandmother used to say similar things. 'Understanding precedes action.'"

The stranger's history continued revealing itself in fragments. Each piece consistent with established narrative. Each piece impossible to verify.

**Day 17 Assessment:**
- Community integration advancing efficiently
- Problem-solving proceeding appropriately
- Personal history details emerging naturally
- Threat assessment unchanged: low

Three days until Tenchi's birthday. The celebration would provide additional observation opportunities.

---
