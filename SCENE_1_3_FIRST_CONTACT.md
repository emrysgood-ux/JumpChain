### POV: SHELDON — 16:15

The old man emerged from between the buildings like he'd been waiting for exactly this moment.

I watched him approach—white hair, deeply lined face, the traditional robes of a Shinto priest rendered in dark blue and white. His movements were careful, deliberate, the movements of someone whose body had learned to negotiate with age rather than fight it. But his eyes were sharp. Sharper than they had any right to be.

"Good afternoon," the old man said, his Japanese crisp and welcoming. "You've climbed quite a distance. Welcome to Masaki Shrine."

I found myself answering in the formal register I'd learned in Kyoto, the words emerging without conscious thought. "Thank you, Gūji-sama. I apologize for arriving unannounced."

The priest's eyebrows rose slightly. "Your Japanese is excellent. Kyoto-trained, unless I miss my guess?"

"Yes, Gūji-sama."

"Formal, though. Very formal." His eyes crinkled with what might have been amusement. "We are somewhat less ceremonious here in the countryside. 'Masaki-san' will do."

"Masaki-san," I repeated. "I am... my name is Tsukino. Sheldon Tsukino."

---

### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:15

The old priest had felt him coming for the last twenty minutes.

Not clearly—not the way he could sense Juraian technology or the specific signature of Funaho's imprisoned guest stirring in her sleep. This was subtler. A ripple in the patterns he'd spent seven centuries learning to read.

He'd emerged from the shrine office when the presence reached the top, and found himself facing someone he'd never seen before.

Dark skin, short hair, clothes that looked vaguely professional but not quite Japanese. And around him—through him—something Katsuhito couldn't name. A resonance that made Funaho's branches shiver, though there was no wind.

The tree felt it too, then. Interesting.

The stranger's response came in formal Japanese—Kyoto-formal, the kind that hadn't been commonly spoken since before the war. Where had an American learned to speak like that?

"Tsukino-san," he said, keeping his voice warm. "What brings you to our mountain?"

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:17

"I don't entirely know," I admitted. "I woke in a field below. I cannot explain how I arrived there. I saw this path and I... followed it."

The priest's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his posture.

"You woke in a field." Not a question. Just a repetition, giving me space to elaborate.

"I have identification," I said, reaching carefully into my pocket. "Documents. I'm not here to cause trouble. I simply don't know where else to go."

I produced the wallet. The priest didn't reach for it, just looked at the driver's license, then back at my face.

"And your documents say you have claim to property here?"

"There's a house. The Tsukino house. According to these, it belongs to me."

The priest was quiet for a long moment. The tree at the center of the grounds moved slightly in a breeze I couldn't feel.

"There is a Tsukino property," he said finally. "On the north side of the compound. It's been empty for some years."

---

### POV: KATSUHITO — 16:20

Seven centuries of watching humans had given him a sense for damaged souls. This one was damaged. But not, he thought, dangerous.

The tree agreed. Funaho's attention had focused on this newcomer with something that felt almost like recognition.

"I remember dying," the stranger said quietly.

The words hung in the afternoon air. Katsuhito had heard many confessions in seven centuries. He had never heard anyone say those words with such certainty.

"That must have been frightening," he said carefully.

"I don't know what it was. I don't know what any of this is."

"And yet you climbed three hundred twenty steps to find out."

"I didn't know there would be steps. I just... walked."

He made a decision. It wasn't based on logic—logic counseled sending this stranger away. It was based on something older.

"The Tsukino house needs work," he said. "Tonight, you can sleep in our guest room. Tomorrow, we'll assess what needs to be done."

The stranger stared at him. "You're saying I can stay?"

"You look like a man who could use a meal."

---

### POV: TENCHI — 16:25

Ojii-chan was talking to someone.

Tenchi stopped at the top of the steps, his school bag heavy on his shoulders. He'd run most of the way from the bus stop, like he always did—up all three hundred and twenty steps. He liked counting.

But now he stopped. Because Ojii-chan was standing near the big tree, talking to a man Tenchi had never seen before.

The man was tall. His skin was dark, darker than anyone Tenchi knew. He was looking at Ojii-chan with an expression Tenchi didn't have words for.

Sad, maybe. Or confused.

"Ah," Ojii-chan said, spotting him. "Tenchi. Come here."

Tenchi walked forward slowly. The stranger turned, and his eyes—they were kind eyes. Tired, but kind.

"This is Tsukino-san," Ojii-chan said. "He's going to be staying at the old house."

"Hello," Tenchi said.

"Hello," the stranger said back. His voice was deep but gentle. "You must be Tenchi."

Tenchi nodded. "I'm four."

"That's a good age."

"Are you going to live here?"

The stranger glanced at Ojii-chan. "I think so. For a while."

"The old house is dusty," Tenchi informed him. This was important. He'd explored it once.

"I'll clean it."

"I can help." The words came before Tenchi thought about them. But the stranger looked like he needed help.

Something shifted in the man's face—not quite a smile, but softer.

"I'd like that," he said.

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:30

The child held out his hand with complete unselfconsciousness.

"I'll show you where we wash our hands," Tenchi said. "Ojii-chan says it's important."

I took his hand. His fingers were warm and small, wrapping around mine with surprising strength.

"Tenchi will give you the tour," Masaki-san said. "I'll prepare the guest room. Dinner will be ready in a few hours."

Tenchi led me to a stone basin near the main building. Water trickled into it from a bamboo pipe.

"You put water on your hands," he explained, demonstrating. "And then you wash them."

I followed his instructions. The cold water was grounding—real water, real stone, a real child teaching me shrine etiquette.

"Are you sad?" Tenchi asked.

The question was so direct I couldn't deflect it.

"I don't know," I said honestly. "I think I might be."

Tenchi considered this. "My mom died," he said. "So I know about being sad."

The words were matter-of-fact, the way children sometimes spoke about enormous things.

"I'm sorry," I said.

"It's okay. Ojii-chan says she's still watching me, even if I can't see her."

I looked down at this four-year-old who spoke about death with casual acceptance.

"I think he might be right," I said.

Tenchi nodded, satisfied. "Come on. I'll show you the old house."

---

### POV: SHELDON — 16:45

The Tsukino house emerged from the trees like something from another century.

Traditional construction, single story, with a roof that sagged slightly at one corner. Shutters closed, engawa dusty, garden overgrown. But the foundation looked solid.

"It's been empty a long time," Tenchi informed me. "Since before I was born."

I stood at the edge of the property, looking at a house that was supposedly mine.

Masaki-san appeared on the path behind us. "The house will need work. But the bones are good. Your family built it well."

*My family.* I didn't have a family—not anymore. But the documents said otherwise.

"Tomorrow we can open it properly," Masaki-san continued. "For tonight, the guest room will be more comfortable."

Tenchi was still holding my hand. He hadn't let go since the washing basin.

"Dinner?" he asked his grandfather.

"Soon. Why don't you show Tsukino-san where we keep the vegetables? He can help you carry them in."

Tenchi's eyes lit up. "This way."

I let him lead me toward a vegetable garden and a dinner I hadn't expected, in a place I'd never meant to find.

Behind me, I could feel the tree watching.
