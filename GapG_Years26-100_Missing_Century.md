# GAP G: YEARS 26-100 — THE MISSING CENTURY
## Son of Cosmos: 2014-2089
## Complete Documentation

---

# OVERVIEW

This is the gap between "post-canon adventures" and "millennium centuries." The period where Sheldon and Yosho build their married life, raise children, watch Tenchi become an adult, lose Nobuyuki, and see Earth begin its integration with the galactic community.

**The Challenge:** This period has been completely empty. No framework existed.

**The Solution:** Build a decade-by-decade structure with key milestones, emotional beats, and domestic texture.

# PART 2: THE WEDDING (Year 27-30)

## The Proposal (Year 24-25, established)

Yosho proposes via Juraian ship-bond tradition — a formal request to share lives across centuries. This was noted in Gap 4 (Post-Canon Adventures).

## The Wedding Decision

**Key Discussion:**
> *Sheldon: "How do we do this? Earth ceremony? Juraian?"*
>
> *Yosho: "Both. Neither."*
>
> *Sheldon: "Meaning?"*
>
> *Yosho: "The village knows us as two men who have lived together for decades. Some have guessed our nature. We do not need to explain or justify. We simply... acknowledge."*
>
> *Pause.*
>
> *"And for Jurai — a ship-bond requires only the ship's blessing. Which Funaho has already given."*

## Year 27 (2016): The Village Acknowledgment

**Setting:** Spring. Cherry blossom season. The shrine.

**What Happens:**
- No formal "wedding ceremony" in the Western sense
- Yosho and Sheldon host a gathering for close friends and family
- Tenchi stands with them (age 31, already in relationship with Ryoko)
- The aunts attend in force
- Village elders attend, having long since accepted the obvious

**The Moment:**
> *Katsuhito (Yosho's public face) addresses the gathering:*
>
> *"For nearly forty years, this man has been my partner in caring for this shrine, this family, this community. Today, we make formal what has long been true. Sheldon is my family. In every way that matters."*
>
> *No one is surprised. Several villagers nod. "About time," someone mutters.*

**The Juraian Component:**
Privately, at the great tree Funaho, a more formal bonding occurs:
- Yosho drops his disguise
- Funaho witnesses
- Light Hawk energy exchanges (Yosho's 3 wings, Sheldon's now-stable 5)
- A bond recognized across dimensions

## The "Honeymoon" (Year 27-28)

**Not Traditional:**
- They don't leave the shrine for months
- Instead: a year of reduced responsibilities
- Tenchi and the aunts manage daily operations
- Sheldon and Yosho have time for EACH OTHER

**Key Experiences:**
- First extended trip off-Earth (diplomatic visit to Jurai station)
- Sheldon meets more of Yosho's extended family
- Formal introduction to Airi (Yosho's second wife, now accepting of the new reality)
- Time in the pocket dimension Washu created for them — private retreat

---

# PART 3: CHILDREN (Years 36-55)

## Year 39 (2028): Achika

**The Birthing Matrix:**
Sheldon builds this himself — a triumph of combining physics knowledge with Lambda energy manipulation. No external assistance.

**The Surprise:**
> *Yosho: "What is this?"*
>
> *Sheldon: "A gift. A possibility. If you want it."*
>
> *Yosho, looking at the device: "You built this?"*
>
> *Sheldon: "Four PhDs, remember? And seventy years of practice with energies I barely understood when I started."*
>
> *Pause.*
>
> *"We can have children. Our children. If you want them."*
>
> *Yosho is silent for a long moment.*
>
> *"...yes."*

**Achika's Birth:**
- Named after Tenchi's mother (honoring family)
- Female, dark hair, Yosho's eyes
- Healthy, robust, immediate crier
- Entire household present for the event

**Washu's Involvement:**
Washu is informed AFTER gestation begins. She arrives, scans the matrix, and goes silent for a full minute.

> *Washu: "You built this yourself."*
>
> *Sheldon: "Yes."*
>
> *Washu: "Without consulting me."*
>
> *Sheldon: "It was supposed to be a surprise. For Yosho."*
>
> *Washu: "A surprise. You invented technology I hadn't invented. As a SURPRISE."*
>
> *Pause.*
>
> *"...I want to study this."*
>
> *Sheldon: "After Achika is born safely."*
>
> *Washu: "Deal."*

## Year 41 (2030): Mamoru

**Second Child:**
- Male, striking pink hair (Usagi's genetics expressing through Sheldon's Cosmos-granted DNA)
- Quieter than Achika, more contemplative
- Yosho's physical features, Sheldon's temperament

**Washu's Role (Changed):**
For Mamoru, Washu ASKS to participate:

> *Washu: "I've been studying your matrix for two years. It's elegant. More elegant than my initial attempts would have been."*
>
> *Sheldon: "Thank you."*
>
> *Washu: "I want to help with the second child. Not because you need me — you clearly don't — but because I want to learn from you."*
>
> *Sheldon: "The greatest scientist in the universe wants to learn from me?"*
>
> *Washu: "The greatest scientist in the universe recognizes genius when she sees it. Even when it's not her own."*

**Ongoing Collaboration:**
From Mamoru onward, Washu assists with children — not out of necessity, but out of mutual scientific respect and genuine care for the family.

## Additional Children (Years 42-60)

**Confirmed:** "Several more" children beyond Achika and Mamoru

**Structure (Placeholder — User to Decide):**

| Child | Birth Year | Gender | Notable Traits |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Achika | ~2028 (Y39) | Female | Dark hair, Yosho's eyes, eldest |
| Mamoru | ~2030 (Y41) | Male | Pink hair, contemplative |
| Third | ~2035 (Y46)? | TBD | TBD |
| Fourth | ~2040 (Y51)? | TBD | TBD |
| Fifth+ | Spread out | TBD | Children continue for decades |

**Spacing Philosophy:**
With lifespans measured in centuries/millennia, there's no rush. Children are spaced 5-10 years apart, allowing each to have focused attention during early years.

## Parenting Dynamic

**Sheldon's Role:**
- Primary caretaker (continues domestic role)
- Teacher (academic subjects, science, languages)
- The "soft" parent — comfort, emotional support
- Cooks every meal; children grow up on Lambda-infused food

**Yosho's Role:**
- Trainer (martial arts, energy control, Juraian heritage)
- Historian (family stories, galactic context)
- The "structure" parent — discipline, expectations
- Teaches each child to meditate by age 5

**Household Support:**
- The aunts are actively involved (Ryoko is surprisingly good with kids)
- Tenchi is "big brother" to all of them
- Washu provides education in advanced subjects when children are ready
- Sasami teaches cooking alongside Sheldon

---

# PART 4: NOBUYUKI (Years 46-60)

## Background

Nobuyuki Masaki: Tenchi's father, Kiyone's widower. By Year 46, he's approximately 80 years old. He remarried (Rea) around Year 17-18, and they've had a good life.

## The Decline (Years 46-55)

**Physical Reality:**
- Enhanced by proximity to Juraian tech and Lambda energy, but still fundamentally human
- Arthritis begins limiting mobility (Year 48)
- Memory issues appear subtly (Year 52)
- Heart problems manifest (Year 54)

**Emotional Landscape:**
- Nobuyuki has watched his son become something cosmic
- He's lived in a household of immortals for decades
- He knows he's the only one who will age out
- He's made peace with it

**Key Conversation (Year 50):**
> *Nobuyuki: "Sheldon-san. May I ask you something personal?"*
>
> *Sheldon: "Of course."*
>
> *Nobuyuki: "How old will you be when you die?"*
>
> *Silence.*
>
> *Sheldon: "I don't know. A very long time. Possibly... never, in the way you mean."*
>
> *Nobuyuki nods.*
>
> *"I thought so. Tenchi too, I think. And Yosho obviously."*
>
> *Pause.*
>
> *"I'm glad. I'm glad my son will have people. Will have you. Long after I'm gone."*
>
> *Sheldon: "Nobuyuki—"*
>
> *Nobuyuki: "Don't. Don't apologize for living. Just... promise you'll look after him. All of them. The way you've looked after us."*
>
> *Sheldon: "I promise."*

## Year 58 (2047): Nobuyuki's Death

**Setting:** Late autumn. The family home (attached to the shrine, expanded over decades).

**Who Is Present:**
- Tenchi (holding his hand)
- Rea (his wife of 30 years)
- Yosho (true form, no disguise — Nobuyuki long since knew)
- Sheldon (cooking Nobuyuki's favorite meal, which Nobuyuki can barely eat)
- The grandchildren (Achika age 19, Mamoru age 17)
- The aunts (gathered but giving space)

**The Death:**
- Peaceful, at home, surrounded by family
- No dramatic last words — just a quiet "thank you"
- He dies in his sleep that night, after the meal
- Tenchi is the one who finds him in the morning

**Grief:**

Tenchi grieves intensely. This is his father — his human connection to normalcy.

Sheldon grieves too — Nobuyuki was the first person outside Yosho to fully accept him.

**The Funeral:**
- Village ceremony (Nobuyuki was known, liked)
- Private family ceremony after
- Buried near Kiyone (his first wife, Tenchi's mother)
- Tenchi speaks; breaks down; Ryoko holds him

**Aftermath:**
The household adjusts. Rea stays on — she's family now. But the last of the "original mortals" is gone.

# PART 5: THE AGING QUESTION

## The Village Notices (Years 30-50)

**The Problem:**
By Year 50, Sheldon has been in the village for 50 years. He arrived looking about 25. He still looks about 25.

**What Villagers See:**
- "Katsuhito" (Yosho) has always been old, so no change noticed
- Sheldon hasn't aged in half a century
- Tenchi aged normally until about 30, then... stopped
- The "aunts" cycle in and out but never age

**The "We Know" Speech (Year 25, referenced):**

Village elders addressed this early:
> *"The American hasn't aged. We don't need to understand. The shrine protects this village. That's enough."*

**Expanded Understanding (Year 50+):**

By this point:
- Earth is becoming aware of extraterrestrial life (gradually)
- The village has seen enough strangeness to accept it
- The Masaki household is "special" — always has been
- Newcomers to the village are told: "Don't ask about the shrine people"

## Managing Appearances

**Strategy:**
- Sheldon and Yosho rarely leave the village area together
- When traveling, they adjust stories as needed
- Documentation is quietly managed (Washu's tech helps)
- They don't hide — they just don't explain

**Reality:**
By Year 60-70, Earth's awareness of the larger universe makes hiding less necessary. By Year 80, it's irrelevant.

---

# PART 6: EARTH CHANGES (Years 60-100)

## Gradual Disclosure (Years 60-80)

**Timeline:**
- Year 60 (~2049): First confirmed extraterrestrial contact (public)
- Year 65 (~2054): Galaxy Police establishes official liaison
- Year 70 (~2059): Jurai makes formal diplomatic overtures
- Year 75 (~2064): Earth applies for galactic community observer status
- Year 80 (~2069): Full integration begins

**The Masaki Household's Role:**
- They stay OUT of the politics initially
- Tenchi is occasionally called upon for diplomatic assistance
- Yosho NEVER formally reveals his identity to Earth governments
- Sheldon serves as occasional translator/bridge (his human origin helps)

## Year 100 (2089): Century Milestone

**Status:**
- Sheldon has been in the Tenchi Muyo universe for 100 years
- He's been with Yosho for 97 of them (romantically for ~73)
- Achika is 61 (looks 30), Mamoru is 59 (looks 28)
- Grandchildren exist, some approaching adulthood
- Earth is a recognized world in galactic community
- The village is protected heritage site

**The Celebration:**
- Not a public event — the family doesn't advertise
- Private gathering at the shrine
- All surviving family members attend
- Cosmos appears briefly in Sheldon's dreams to acknowledge the milestone

**Sheldon's Reflection (Year 100):**
> *One hundred years.*
>
> *In my first life, I barely made forty.*
>
> *In this one, I've had a century. And there are nine more to come.*
>
> *I've raised children. Buried a friend. Watched a civilization change. Built a family that will outlive nations.*
>
> *And I'm still in love with the same alien prince who took me in on Day One.*
>
> *Whatever Cosmos intended when she sent me here... I think this is it. This is the purpose. Not power. Not cosmic significance. Just... this. Love sustained across time. Family built across species. Home.*

# PART 7: SHELDON-YOSHO RELATIONSHIP EVOLUTION

## Decades of Marriage

| Period | Relationship Stage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Years 26-35 | Honeymoon — learning to be married after decades of partnership |
| Years 36-50 | Parenting — shared purpose deepens bond |
| Years 51-65 | Grief and growth — loss of Nobuyuki tests them |
| Years 66-80 | Established comfort — no pretense, complete knowing |
| Years 81-100 | Elder partnership — mentoring next generation together |

## Key Relationship Beats

**First Major Fight (Year 32):**
About what? Something small that reveals larger tensions:
> *The fight isn't about the dishes. It's never about the dishes.*
>
> *It's about Yosho still keeping secrets after forty years. Small ones. Old habits.*
>
> *They argue. Actually argue. First time in years.*
>
> *Resolution comes three days later. Yosho apologizes. Not for the secrets — for not realizing they still hurt.*

**The Hundred-Year Promise (Year 50):**
> *Yosho: "We have been together fifty years."*
>
> *Sheldon: "Yes."*
>
> *Yosho: "I intend to be with you for at least a thousand more."*
>
> *Sheldon: "Is that a promise?"*
>
> *Yosho: "It is an intention. I have learned not to promise things I cannot fully control. But I intend it with everything I am."*

**The Night Nobuyuki Died (Year 58):**
> *They don't talk. They just lie together. Holding on.*
>
> *Sheldon has lived through loss before. Yosho has lived through centuries of it.*
>
> *Neither is used to it. Neither will ever be.*

## Physical Intimacy Over Decades

Not explicit, but acknowledged:
- They share a bedroom (always have, since Year 25)
- Physical affection is normalized in the household
- Children grow up seeing their parents kiss, hold hands, touch casually
- The relationship is modeled as healthy, long-term commitment
