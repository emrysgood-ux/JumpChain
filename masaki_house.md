## NOBUYUKI'S ROOM - CRITICAL DETAIL

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets Q28

### Pre-Canon Function (1989)

> "...he originally worked at home in his room..."

In 1989, Nobuyuki's room serves as:
- His bedroom
- His HOME OFFICE where he works
- Where he does his architectural design work
- The room where he spends most of his time

### Post-Canon Function (After Ryoko moves house)

> "...but after Ryoko moved the house near Masaki shrine, he works in his office and lives alone in a one-room flat not to disturb Tenchi..."

The room then:
- Becomes Mihoshi's room
- No longer Nobuyuki's workspace
- He relocates to city apartment

### Room Evolution Timeline

| Period | Occupant | Function |
|--------|----------|----------|
| 1989-2001 | Nobuyuki | Bedroom + Home Office |
| Post-Mihoshi | Mihoshi | Her bedroom |
| Post-Mihoshi | Nobuyuki | Lives in city apartment |

## THE FLOATING ONSEN

**Source:** 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets

### Origin

The famous floating onsen is NOT a natural hot spring:

> "The onsen is Ryoko's creation using Washu's matter-creation system."

**Key Points:**
- Created by Ryoko (not natural)
- Uses Washu's matter-creation technology
- Appears after Ryoko's release (Year 13+)
- Not present in pre-canon period (1989-2001)

### Story Implication

In 1989, there is NO floating onsen at the Masaki residence. It only appears after Ryoko is released and has access to Washu's technology.
