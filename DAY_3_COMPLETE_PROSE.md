# DAY 3 — THE CARPENTER
## April 5, 1989 (Wednesday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Tsukino House → Main House → Village (Yamada's workshop) → Tsukino House (with Yamada) → Main House → Tsukino House  
**Weather:** Partly cloudy, 17°C high, 10°C low, occasional light rain  
**Sunrise:** 5:50 AM | **Sunset:** 6:27 PM

## SCENE 1: WAKING ROUTINE
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The third morning arrived without ceremony.

The uguisu had found a new perch—closer to the Tsukino house now, its three-note song entering through gaps in the window frame that Sheldon added to his mental inventory. Weather sealing. Another task for the list that grew longer with each hour of observation.

He rose with the bird's song, the motion fluid and unforced. His body continued to perform without complaint, recovering from each day's activities as if they hadn't occurred. The strangeness of this had begun to fade into acceptance—not understanding, but acceptance. The body worked. The mind functioned. Questions of *why* and *how* could wait until he had space to examine them.

The morning routine had established itself: toilet, face wash with cold water, examination of the silver flecks in his eyes (unchanged, still present, still unexplained), dressing in the work clothes Katsuhito had provided—Nobuyuki's old garments, worn but solid, fitting well enough for purpose.

---

## SCENE 2: WEATHER OBSERVATION
**Time:** 05:58:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

Clouds had moved in overnight.

Not the solid gray of imminent rain, but the broken cover that suggested uncertainty—the sky deciding what kind of day this would be. The temperature had dropped slightly, the breeze carrying moisture from the west. Weather patterns in this region moved from the ocean inland, Sheldon recalled. Someone had taught him that, or he'd read it, or the knowledge had been placed in his mind along with everything else.

The village siren sounded at six, its tone muffled by the cloud cover. Another day began for everyone on this mountain.

---

## SCENE 3: WALK TO MAIN HOUSE
**Time:** 06:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Path between Tsukino House and Main House

Cherry petals carpeted the path.

Last night's breeze had accelerated the blossom fall, stripping flowers from branches that had been full three days ago. The peak was ending. In a week, the trees would stand green and leafy, their spring display concluded until next year.

*Mono no aware*. The bittersweet awareness of impermanence. The phrase surfaced without prompting—another piece of cultural knowledge his benefactor had considered necessary. The Japanese aesthetic of accepting transience, of finding beauty in the passing rather than fighting against it.

He walked through the fallen petals toward breakfast.

---

## SCENE 4: BREAKFAST DYNAMICS
**Time:** 06:35:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Nobuyuki was still asleep.

"He arrived late," Katsuhito explained, "and Tenchi kept him awake with questions until nearly midnight. Let him rest."

So the table held three: Katsuhito, Tenchi (dressed for kindergarten, hair still askew), and Sheldon. The meal proceeded with familiar rhythm—rice, soup, fish, pickles. The pickles today were different, slightly sweeter, with a hint of citrus Sheldon couldn't identify.

"These are from Etsuko's recipe," Katsuhito said, noting his attention. "The last batch. I've been saving them."

"For what?"

"For someone who would appreciate them."

The implied meaning settled without elaboration. Etsuko's pickles, served to the person who'd inherited Etsuko's house. Connections spanning death and time, maintained through preserved vegetables.

---

## SCENE 5: TENCHI'S MORNING WISDOM
**Time:** 06:52:17 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

"The rain is going to come," Tenchi announced between bites of rice.

"How do you know?" Sheldon asked.

"The frogs told me."

Katsuhito's expression suggested this wasn't unusual. "Tenchi has... sensitivity to such things."

"The frogs said it would rain after lunch," Tenchi continued, "but not hard rain. Soft rain. The kind that makes the flowers happy."

Sheldon considered the child's certainty. Children invented explanations for their intuitions all the time. But something about Tenchi's delivery suggested more than imagination—the specificity of timing, the distinction between rain types.

"If the frogs are right," he said carefully, "we should plan morning activities accordingly."

Tenchi nodded, satisfied that his intelligence had been taken seriously.

---

## SCENE 6: WALKING TENCHI TO KINDERGARTEN
**Time:** 07:25:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps (descending)

Today Sheldon made the descent alone with Tenchi.

Katsuhito had morning duties at the shrine—prayers and offerings that required his presence. Nobuyuki still slept. And the walk provided opportunity for the kind of conversation that developed only between two people moving in the same direction.

"Do you like kindergarten?" Sheldon asked as they navigated the steps.

"It's okay. Hayashi-kun is funny. Sensei is nice." A pause. "I don't like nap time."

"Why not?"

"I'm not sleepy then. I'm sleepy at breakfast."

The logic of a child's body clock, refusing to align with institutional scheduling. Sheldon remembered similar frustrations from his own education, though the details had blurred with time.

"What do you do during nap time?"

"I count things. The ceiling has forty-seven tiles. The window has twelve squares. Sensei has thirty-four gray hairs but she gets more every day."

---

## SCENE 7: KINDERGARTEN OBSERVATIONS
**Time:** 07:48:15 JST  
**Location:** Village kindergarten entrance

Yamamoto-sensei emerged again at their approach.

"Tsukino-san. Good morning." Her tone was warmer today, the initial surprise of yesterday resolved into something approaching acceptance. "Thank you for walking Tenchi."

"My pleasure."

"He mentioned you at circle time yesterday. He said you came from far away but you're staying now."

"That's accurate."

"He also said you're going to fix the broken house and then teach him how."

Sheldon glanced at Tenchi, who had already moved toward the kindergarten door, distracted by something inside. "I'll certainly let him watch, if his family permits."

"Tenchi watches everything." Yamamoto-sensei's expression shifted toward something maternal and slightly concerned. "He notices details other children miss. It's a gift, but it can be difficult."

The observation landed with unexpected resonance. Sheldon filed it away: Tenchi's attention to detail, presented as both strength and burden.

---

## SCENE 8: THE RETURN CLIMB
**Time:** 08:05:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps (ascending)

Three hundred twenty steps.

The count had become automatic now, his feet finding the rhythm without conscious attention. Each landing marked progress, each stone carrying the accumulated wear of countless previous climbers.

Halfway up, he paused—not from fatigue, but to listen. The forest sounds had changed since yesterday. Birds he didn't recognize called from positions invisible in the canopy. Something small moved through undergrowth to his left, disturbed by his presence. The mountain was alive in ways that city living had made easy to forget.

*Did I live in a city before?*

The question surfaced unbidden. His previous life—the one that ended at the particle accelerator—had included university positions, research facilities, the infrastructure of academic physics. Cities, presumably. But the memories remained fragmentary, pieces without a clear timeline.

He resumed climbing. The mountain waited at the top.

---

## SCENE 9: PREPARATION FOR YAMADA
**Time:** 08:35:17 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

Katsuhito had completed his morning duties.

He sat now in the main room, still in ceremonial robes but visibly relaxing as the formal portion of the day concluded. Steam rose from a cup of tea that Sheldon hadn't seen him prepare—another example of the old man's efficient movement through space.

"Yamada will meet us at his workshop," Katsuhito said. "Nine o'clock. He's expecting a foreigner."

"Is that unusual here?"

"For this village? You may be the first in living memory to actually reside." A pause. "Tourists pass through occasionally. The shrine draws some visitors. But residents—no."

The weight of the statement settled. Sheldon would be a curiosity, a subject of discussion, an object of study by people who had known each other for generations.

"How should I approach him?"

"As you have approached me. Honestly. Without pretense." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "Yamada respects competence, but he respects humility more. Don't pretend to know what you don't."

"I don't intend to."

"Good. Then you'll likely succeed."

---

## SCENE 10: WALKING TO THE VILLAGE
**Time:** 08:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Village road

The village proper began where the shrine road ended.

Traditional homes lined both sides, their designs similar but not identical—variations on a theme developed over centuries of living in this particular climate. Tile roofs, wooden siding, small gardens that varied from meticulously maintained to respectably overgrown.

"The Yamada family has lived here for seven generations," Katsuhito said as they walked. "Kenji learned from his father, who learned from his father. The craft passes down."

"Do they specialize in roofing?"

"They specialize in wood. Framing, finishing, whatever the job requires. Roofing is part of the larger skill set."

An elderly woman emerged from a doorway to their right, pausing when she saw them. Her eyes moved from Katsuhito—familiar, expected—to Sheldon—unfamiliar, requiring assessment.

"Good morning, Tanaka-san," Katsuhito said.

"Good morning, Priest-sama." Her gaze remained on Sheldon. "This is the Tsukino relative?"

"Tsukino Sheldon. He's come to restore Etsuko's house."

"Ah." The syllable carried weight—approval, perhaps, or at least the suspension of judgment. "Etsuko would be pleased."

She entered her house before Sheldon could respond. The interaction had lasted ten seconds, but he understood it would generate hours of village conversation.

---

## SCENE 11: YAMADA'S WORKSHOP
**Time:** 09:02:33 JST  
**Location:** Yamada workshop, entrance

The building announced its function before any sign confirmed it.

Wood shavings drifted in the morning breeze outside an open door. The smell of fresh lumber mixed with the sharper scent of lacquer or varnish. Tools hung on visible racks inside, their arrangement speaking to organization refined over decades.

A man emerged as they approached. Mid-fifties, Sheldon estimated. Broad shoulders and calloused hands, the physique of someone who worked with heavy materials daily. His face arranged itself in an expression of professional neutrality—neither welcoming nor hostile, simply assessing.

"Priest-sama. Good morning." His eyes moved to Sheldon. "This is the foreigner."

"Tsukino Sheldon," Katsuhito said. "He's inherited Etsuko's house."

"I know." Yamada's gaze was direct, evaluating. "I heard yesterday. Everyone heard yesterday."

"I apologize for any disruption my arrival has caused," Sheldon said.

"Disruption?" Yamada's expression shifted slightly—not quite amusement, but something adjacent. "You haven't done anything yet. The disruption comes from people who can't mind their own business."

---

## SCENE 12: THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT
**Time:** 09:08:15 JST  
**Location:** Yamada workshop, interior

Yamada invited them inside with a gesture rather than words.

The workshop was exactly what Sheldon had expected: tools organized by function, raw lumber stored by type and size, a workbench scarred by decades of projects. The air tasted of sawdust and effort.

"The roof," Yamada said without preamble. "Priest-sama said you found damage."

"Three rafters showing water damage. One compromised at the joint. Tiles displaced in the northwest section."

Yamada's eyebrows rose slightly—the first visible reaction to anything Sheldon had said. "You examined it yourself?"

"I climbed into the crawlspace yesterday. With a flashlight."

"And you identified the specific problems?"

"I identified what I could see. I have no training in construction. My assessment may be incomplete or incorrect."

Something in Yamada's posture relaxed. "That's the right answer. Most people who don't know what they're doing pretend they do."

"I'm not in a position to pretend. The house needs repair, and I need someone who can do the work properly."

---

## SCENE 13: YAMADA'S CONDITIONS
**Time:** 09:18:44 JST  
**Location:** Yamada workshop, workbench area

"I'll look at it," Yamada said. "Today, if weather permits."

Katsuhito had moved to examine some finished work near the workshop's rear—giving the conversation space to develop without his presence shaping it.

"I appreciate that," Sheldon said.

"Don't appreciate yet. I haven't told you my conditions."

"Conditions?"

"I don't carry passengers." Yamada's directness had a physical quality, as if the words themselves bore weight. "If I do this job, you work alongside me. I'm not your employee. I'm teaching you to repair your own house."

The condition was unexpected. Sheldon had assumed he'd hire expertise, pay for service, remain a client rather than a participant.

"Why?"

"Because Etsuko was my friend. Because that house deserves someone who understands it. Because I'm seventy-three years old and I'm not climbing ladders alone anymore."

The last reason, delivered with the same flat directness, contained more vulnerability than anything else Yamada had said. He needed help. The help had arrived in the form of a foreigner with no construction knowledge. He was making the best of available options.

"I'll work," Sheldon said. "I'll learn. I'll do whatever you need me to do."

---

## SCENE 14: TERMS DISCUSSED
**Time:** 09:28:33 JST  
**Location:** Yamada workshop, workbench area

"The cost," Yamada continued. "Materials at my cost, which is better than you'll get retail. Labor—we discuss after I see the actual damage. If it's what you describe, the price will be fair. If it's worse, the price increases."

"That seems reasonable."

"It is reasonable. I don't cheat people." A pause. "Some in the village will wonder if I'm cheating you because you're foreign. They'll be wrong, but they'll wonder."

"I'm not concerned about village speculation."

"You should be. You'll be living here. What people think matters."

The practical wisdom landed. Sheldon was accustomed to academic environments where reputation derived from publications and grants, not from the cumulative assessment of neighbors. This community operated on different principles.

"What should I do about it?"

"Nothing actively. Just don't give them reasons. Pay your bills. Honor your agreements. Show up when you say you will."

"I can do those things."

"Then you'll probably be fine."

---

## SCENE 15: THE WALK TO TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 09:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Village road, heading toward shrine

Yamada had agreed to inspect the house immediately.

He walked beside Sheldon now, Katsuhito trailing slightly—allowing the younger men (though Yamada was hardly young) to establish their own dynamic. The carpenter moved with the deliberate pace of someone who had learned that rushing produced mistakes.

"The house has good bones," Yamada said as they walked. "Etsuko's grandfather built it. He knew what he was doing."

"You knew him?"

"I knew his work. The joints are hand-cut, not machine-made. The foundation stones were placed by someone who understood how water moves through soil. Buildings like that don't get constructed anymore."

"Why not?"

"Time. Cost. No one wants to pay for hand-cut joints when machines can do it faster. But the machine cuts don't last as long. They're not fitted to the specific wood; they're averaged across all wood."

The distinction illuminated something Sheldon hadn't considered. Traditional construction as a form of precision, each element customized to its context rather than standardized for efficiency.

---

## SCENE 16: ASCENDING TOGETHER
**Time:** 09:55:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine steps

Yamada climbed the three hundred twenty steps without visible effort.

At seventy-three, his conditioning exceeded anything Sheldon had expected. The carpenter's breathing remained steady, his pace undiminished, his attention shifting between the path and the forest around them.

"These steps need work," Yamada observed. "Some of the stones have shifted."

"The shrine's responsibility," Katsuhito said from behind.

"I know whose responsibility they are. I'm just noting the need."

The exchange carried the weight of old acquaintance—men who had known each other for decades, whose relationship included the permission to speak plainly.

"I'm not a young priest anymore," Katsuhito said. "The steps will outlast me regardless."

"Everything outlasts everyone. That's not an excuse for neglect."

---

## SCENE 17: ARRIVING AT TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 10:12:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Yamada's assessment began before they reached the front door.

He walked the perimeter slowly, pausing at points Sheldon had noticed and at others he hadn't. His hands touched the wood in places, testing give and resilience. His eyes moved constantly, tracking patterns invisible to untrained observation.

"The foundation has shifted," he said finally. "Northwest corner, as you'd expect from the roof damage. Water entry followed the path of least resistance."

"Is the shifting structural?"

"Not yet. But it will become structural if the water continues. First priority: stop the water. Second priority: correct the settling. Third priority: repair what's been damaged."

The systematic approach matched how Sheldon thought about complex problems—identify the primary failure mode, address it before addressing secondary effects.

"How long will the first priority take?"

"With two people working? Two weeks if the weather cooperates. Three if it doesn't."

---

## SCENE 18: ROOF INSPECTION
**Time:** 10:35:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior roof view

Yamada had brought a ladder.

Not the one from the workshop—a different ladder, telescoping, that he'd apparently carried on his back during the climb. Sheldon hadn't noticed it until now, which said something about either Yamada's strength or Sheldon's observational limits.

The ladder extended to reach the roof edge. Yamada climbed first, his movements confident despite his age. Sheldon followed at the carpenter's direction, finding handholds where indicated.

From the roof, the damage was more visible than from inside. Tiles had shifted in a pattern radiating from a central point—the impact zone, perhaps, from a falling branch or accumulated snow. Gaps showed where water could enter, where water had entered, where water would continue entering until the pattern was corrected.

"This is repairable," Yamada said. "But not by patching. The entire northwest section needs to be stripped, refelted, and retiled."

"What about the rafters underneath?"

"That's what we'll look at next."

---

## SCENE 19: CRAWLSPACE INSPECTION
**Time:** 10:55:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof crawlspace

Two flashlights made the inspection more thorough.

Yamada moved through the crawlspace with familiarity that surprised Sheldon—then didn't, once he considered the carpenter's decades of experience in such spaces. Every house had a crawlspace. Every crawlspace told stories about the house above it.

"Here." Yamada's light focused on the compromised rafter joint Sheldon had identified yesterday. "You were right. This needs replacement, not repair."

"The other two I noticed?"

"Water damage, but not structural failure. We can treat them, reinforce them, leave them in place." He shifted his light to examine the ridge beam. "The central structure is sound. Etsuko's grandfather really did know his work."

The praise for a man dead before Yamada was born carried genuine respect. Craft connecting across generations, quality recognized by those who understood what quality meant.

---

## SCENE 20: THE QUOTE
**Time:** 11:25:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

They sat around the dusty table, Yamada's assessment complete.

"Materials for the roof: tiles, felt, the replacement rafter, fasteners, treatment chemicals." He produced a small notebook, penciling numbers as he spoke. "I can get everything at contractor rates. Total materials: approximately thirty thousand yen."

The number meant nothing to Sheldon without context. "Is that reasonable?"

"It's what the materials cost. I'm not adding markup."

"I meant—is the scope of work reasonable for that cost?"

Yamada's expression suggested appreciation for the distinction. "For this extent of damage, with quality materials? Yes. Cheap repairs would cost half as much and fail in five years. I don't do cheap repairs."

"I wouldn't ask you to."

"Good. Labor—" He paused, penciling more figures. "Three days to strip and prepare. Three days to rafter work. Four days to retile and seal. If you work alongside me as agreed, I'll charge twenty thousand for my time."

"Fifty thousand total."

"Approximately. Contingency for unexpected problems—call it sixty thousand as the ceiling."

Sheldon considered his bankbook balances. The figures he'd seen suggested ample funds, though he remained uncertain about the financial mechanics of his new identity.

"I can pay that."

---

## SCENE 21: AGREEMENTS
**Time:** 11:42:15 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

"We start tomorrow," Yamada said. "Six AM, assuming weather permits."

"I'll be ready."

"Dress for work. Old clothes. Nothing you care about." He stood, his joints protesting slightly despite his general fitness. "I'll bring initial supplies. You'll learn to carry the heavy things up those steps."

"The steps are good exercise."

"The steps are a test. Etsuko used to say anyone who wouldn't climb them didn't deserve what waited at the top."

The characterization fit what Sheldon had learned of his great-aunt through fragments and implications. A woman who valued effort, who believed in earning access rather than receiving it.

"She sounds formidable."

"She was. She also made pickles that could convert anyone who tasted them." Yamada moved toward the door. "Priest-sama, I'll see myself out. You should stay—there are things to discuss."

Katsuhito nodded, remaining seated. The carpenter departed with the same deliberate efficiency he'd shown throughout the morning.

---

## SCENE 22: POST-ASSESSMENT DISCUSSION
**Time:** 11:55:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

"He accepted you," Katsuhito said once Yamada's footsteps had faded.

"It felt more like evaluation than acceptance."

"It was both. Yamada doesn't separate the two." Katsuhito shifted position, settling more comfortably on the cushion. "He could have refused. He's refused others—people from the city who bought village properties, expecting services without contributing anything in return."

"What convinced him?"

"Your honesty about your limitations. Your willingness to work rather than simply pay. And—" A pause. "He saw something. In how you examined the roof damage."

"I just described what I observed."

"You described it in terms of systems and failure modes. Like an engineer would. He respects that kind of thinking."

---

## SCENE 23: TENCHI'S RAIN PREDICTION
**Time:** 12:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The rain arrived precisely after lunch.

Soft, as Tenchi had predicted. Not a downpour but a gentle persistence, water falling from clouds that had fulfilled the morning's ambiguity. Sheldon stood on the engawa, watching the drops create patterns in puddles forming on the path.

"The frogs were right," he said.

Katsuhito had remained for a simple lunch—rice balls prepared that morning, pickles from Etsuko's last batch, tea brewed on the now-functional gas stove. The meal had been eaten in companionable silence, two men settling into routines that didn't require constant conversation.

"Tenchi is often right about such things," Katsuhito said. "His mother had similar sensitivities."

The past tense again. Sheldon noted it without comment.

"Is it common? In your family?"

"More common than in most families. Less common than it should be, if the old stories are accurate." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "Every generation loses something. Every generation gains something different. The balance changes."

---

## SCENE 24: AFTERNOON RAIN
**Time:** 13:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, main room

The rain continued its gentle assault.

Sheldon had begun cleaning—a task he could manage without expertise or equipment. The dust of three years accumulated on every surface, responding to damp cloth and patient effort. Each pass revealed the wood beneath, the grain patterns, the character of material that had been assembled before automobiles existed.

"You don't rest," Katsuhito observed. He had settled with a book from somewhere—ancient-looking, its characters too complex for Sheldon to read at this distance.

"Resting feels like waiting. Waiting feels like wasting the time I've been given."

"Time isn't wasted by sitting quietly."

"For some people. I'm not one of them."

Katsuhito's expression suggested he disagreed but chose not to argue. "There's a difference between productive activity and avoidance of stillness."

"I'm aware. This is the former."

"Is it?"

The question landed with more weight than its casual delivery suggested. Sheldon paused mid-wipe, considering.

"I don't know," he admitted finally. "But cleaning needs doing regardless of my motivations."

"That's true. Just don't confuse necessity with wisdom."

---

## SCENE 25: TENCHI'S RETURN
**Time:** 14:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, engawa

Nobuyuki collected Tenchi from kindergarten in the rain.

The father and son returned together, sheltered under an umbrella decorated with cartoon characters. Tenchi's voice carried through the precipitation—recounting his day, describing activities, asking questions that didn't pause for answers.

Sheldon had returned to the main house an hour earlier, leaving the Tsukino property to dry from his cleaning efforts. The afternoon had settled into a rhythm of quiet: Katsuhito reading, Nobuyuki resting, Sheldon examining the book collection for titles he might understand.

"Sheldon-san!" Tenchi spotted him from the path. "Did you see the rain? The frogs knew!"

"I saw. You were right."

"I'm always right about rain." The child's certainty contained no arrogance—simple statement of observed fact. "Sometimes I'm wrong about snow, but never rain."

Nobuyuki's expression as he followed his son up the engawa suggested this wasn't exaggeration. Another data point about Tenchi's unusual perceptions.

---

## SCENE 26: FAMILY AFTERNOON
**Time:** 15:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

The four of them gathered as the rain strengthened.

Tenchi worked on a drawing at the low table—shapes that might have been buildings or mountains or something entirely abstract. Nobuyuki watched with the particular attention of a father memorizing moments. Katsuhito had set aside his book, content to observe the family dynamic he'd cultivated for years.

"The carpenter agreed?" Nobuyuki asked.

"He did. We start tomorrow."

"Yamada's good. Stubborn, but good." Nobuyuki's assessment carried professional weight—an architect evaluating a craftsman. "If he's teaching you while working, you'll learn more than you expect."

"He made that clear."

"He usually does." A pause. "My wife—" The word seemed to cost him something. "She commissioned a bookshelf from him once. He taught her how to sand the wood before he'd let her see the finished piece."

"That sounds consistent with his approach."

"It is. He believes people should understand what goes into making something. Not just pay for the result."

---

## SCENE 27: THE PHOTOGRAPH QUESTION
**Time:** 15:35:22 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

Tenchi looked up from his drawing.

"Sheldon-san, do you have pictures?"

"Pictures?"

"Of your family. Grandfather has pictures of everyone. Even people who are gone."

The question touched something Sheldon hadn't examined. The photographs from Etsuko's collection—his documented family—remained at the Tsukino house. But pictures of his actual family, the one from his life before the field...

"I have some," he said carefully. "They're at my house. I found them yesterday."

"Can I see them?"

Nobuyuki started to intervene, but Sheldon raised a hand slightly.

"Soon. When the house is cleaner. I don't want them to get dusty."

Tenchi accepted this with a nod. "My papa has pictures of my mama. He keeps them in his room in Kurashiki."

The sentence hung in the air. Nobuyuki's expression tightened almost imperceptibly.

"I remember," the father said quietly. "Would you like to see them when we get home?"

"Yes." Tenchi returned to his drawing, the emotional weight apparently resolved in his mind. "I want to show them to Sheldon-san too. Someday."

---

## SCENE 28: DINNER PREPARATION
**Time:** 17:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, kitchen

The rain had stopped by evening.

Clouds remained, blocking the sunset but allowing enough light to work by. Sheldon found himself once again preparing vegetables—his assigned role in the household cooking rhythm, accepted without discussion.

"You're getting faster," Nobuyuki observed. He had joined the kitchen crew today, contributing expertise Sheldon lacked in preparing fish.

"Practice helps."

"It does. You know—" Nobuyuki paused, his knife work never faltering. "I wasn't sure about you. When Father called, when he said a relative had appeared... I worried."

"That's reasonable."

"Tenchi attaches quickly. He lost his mother two years ago. If you disappeared, it would hurt him."

The directness was unexpected but welcome. Sheldon set down his knife, giving the conversation his full attention.

"I'm not disappearing. I have a house here, a commitment to repair it, a life I'm trying to build."

"Lives get interrupted."

"They do. But I'm not planning on mine being interrupted any further than it already has been."

Nobuyuki studied him for a long moment. Whatever assessment occurred behind his eyes concluded with a slight nod.

"Good. That's what I needed to hear."

---

## SCENE 29: THE EVENING MEAL
**Time:** 18:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, dining area

Fish tonight—the river catch from yesterday, prepared in a style Nobuyuki called his mother-in-law's recipe.

Sheldon tasted generations in each bite. Seasonings chosen by hands long still, techniques passed from teacher to student until they arrived at this table, this moment, this gathering of people who had no clear reason to sit together but did anyway.

"Mama made it sweeter," Tenchi said.

Nobuyuki's expression flickered. "I try to remember how she did it."

"I know." Tenchi's tone held no accusation, only observation. "It's still good. Just different."

The acceptance—child's acceptance, without the protective armor adults wrapped around their grief—shifted something in the room's atmosphere. Nobuyuki blinked rapidly, once, twice.

"Thank you, Tenchi."

"You're welcome, Papa."

---

## SCENE 30: AFTER-DINNER CONVERSATION
**Time:** 19:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Main House, main room

"The council meeting," Katsuhito said once Tenchi had been excused to prepare for bed. "Have you considered what you'll say?"

"I'll introduce myself. Explain my connection to the house. Describe my plans for repair."

"And if they ask about your background? Your parents, your life before arriving here?"

The question struck at something Sheldon hadn't prepared for. His documented history existed—the koseki, the family registry, the paper trail his benefactor had constructed. But speaking that history aloud, claiming it as lived experience when it had been created rather than experienced...

"I'll tell them what the documents show."

"The documents show a Japanese-American with family connections to this village. They don't show how you came to be standing in a field three days ago."

"No. They don't."

"If someone asks directly—"

"I'll redirect. I don't intend to lie, but I also don't intend to answer questions I can't answer truthfully."

Katsuhito considered this. "That's a narrow path."

"It's the only path I have."

---

## SCENE 31: TENCHI'S BEDTIME
**Time:** 19:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, hallway

"Good night, Sheldon-san."

The nightly ritual, becoming familiar. Tenchi in his sleeping clothes, Nobuyuki waiting behind, the formal bow that preceded informal goodnight.

"Good night, Tenchi. Sleep well."

"I will. The frogs said tomorrow will be sunny."

"Then we'll have good weather for working."

"What kind of work?"

"Roof repair. Yamada-san is teaching me."

Tenchi's eyes widened. "Yamada-jii-san is scary."

"Scary?"

"He never smiles. And he yells at people who do things wrong."

"I'll try not to do things wrong, then."

"He'll yell anyway. Everyone does things wrong the first time." The wisdom of a five-year-old, delivered with complete certainty. "But then you learn."

"That's true. Goodnight, Tenchi."

"Goodnight."

## SCENE 32: EVENING BATH
**Time:** 20:15:00 JST  
**Location:** Main House, bathroom

Guest first, again.

The routine had established itself without negotiation—Sheldon first, then Nobuyuki, then Katsuhito. The water remained hot through all three uses, the fire carefully managed, the system functioning as designed.

Sheldon examined his body in the privacy of the bath. The silver flecks in his eyes—he'd checked in the kitchen's small mirror—remained unchanged. His skin showed no marks, no variations, no evidence of the transformation his existence implied.

*What am I becoming?*

The question surfaced without warning. Not panic—something quieter. Curiosity, perhaps. Or the beginning of acceptance that answers might not arrive on any schedule he could predict.

He soaked in the heat and let the question settle into the water around him.

## SCENE 33: WALK TO TSUKINO HOUSE
**Time:** 20:55:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between Main House and Tsukino House

The clouds had thinned, revealing scattered stars.

The path showed traces of the afternoon's rain—puddles in low spots, mud where drainage pooled, the particular smell of wet earth releasing stored warmth. Cherry petals had become paste in the wetter areas, their pink smeared into mud-brown.

Sheldon's borrowed lantern cast its familiar circle of light. The house waited at the path's end, visible now through the trees as a dark shape against the darker mountain behind it.

Tomorrow, the roof work would begin. Physical labor, learning by doing, the first concrete step toward making this inheritance real. The prospect felt appropriate—better than more waiting, more planning, more talking about what needed to happen.

## SCENE 34: PREPARING FOR SLEEP
**Time:** 21:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

The futon unfolded with practiced ease.

Three nights. His hands had learned the motions, the specific folds, the arrangement that made the difference between restful sleep and persistent discomfort. Small competencies, building toward larger ones.

Tomorrow's requirements circled through his thoughts: wake early, dress for labor, meet Yamada at six. The carpenter would bring initial supplies. Sheldon would provide effort, attention, willingness to learn.

*I can do this.*

The certainty surprised him. Not arrogance—something more fundamental. A sense that the work ahead was within his capabilities, that the body he'd been given would meet the demands he placed on it.

He lay in the darkness, listening to the house settle, and let sleep approach on its own terms.

## SCENE 35: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** During sleep  
**Location:** Dreamscape

The white space returned.

Not Dorothy Mae's kitchen this time—directly to the luminous emptiness, the presence at the edge of vision. They stood closer tonight, or he perceived them more clearly. Features remained indistinct, but scale became apparent: tall, impossibly tall, a figure that would tower over any human who stood beside them.

*You're doing well.*

The words arrived without sound, meaning without medium. Communication in its purest form, unmediated by air or language.

*I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.*

*You're doing it. Continue.*

*But what is "it"? What's the purpose?*

Silence. Not refusal—something else. As if the question itself contained an error they chose not to correct.

The presence moved closer. Warmth radiated from them, or the perception of warmth—heat without temperature, comfort without physical source.

*You will understand. When you're ready.*

*How will I know when I'm ready?*

The presence smiled. He couldn't see the smile, couldn't perceive features clearly enough to identify expression. But he felt it—the warmth intensifying, a sense of affection vast enough to encompass galaxies.

*You'll know.*

## SCENE 36: FOURTH DAWN
**Time:** 05:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, bedroom

He woke to the uguisu's call.

The dream lingered—the presence, their warmth, the promise of understanding that would come when he was ready. None of it made sense by the standards of his waking mind. All of it felt true by standards he couldn't articulate.

Day four. Roof work began today. The first physical manifestation of his commitment to this place, this life, this impossible gift he still didn't understand.

He rose to meet it.
