# PART I: CHARACTER VOICE CARDS

## Sheldon Tsukino — Voice Card

**One-Line Summary:** Analytical mind with self-deprecating humor, hiding depth behind careful simplicity.

**Internal Narration:**
- Syntax: Complex sentences with embedded clauses; scientific precision
- Diction: Academic vocabulary deployed unconsciously; self-deprecating humor
- Rhythm: Analytical, observational pauses; quick pivots to humor
- Imagery: Scientific metaphors, cooking comparisons, occasional cosmic wonder
- Register: Intelligent but not showing off; hiding depth

**Sounds Like:**
> *"The probability of landing in a timeline where his fabricated documents would hold up to scrutiny was... actually, he had no idea. Statistics required data. He had memories, a wallet, and what appeared to be very convincing fingerprints."*

> *"I don't know where I came from. But I can work. If you'll let me stay."*

**Never Sounds Like:**
- Simple declarative thoughts lacking analytical layer
- Pure emotional expression without intellectual processing
- Cosmic awareness before Year 1 dream
- Vocabulary that sounds like other characters

**Key Evolution:**
| Year | Voice Stage |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Most guarded externally, most analytical internally |
| 5 | More relaxed, humor emerging in speech |
| 13+ | Full integration of internal/external voices |

---

## Katsuhito/Yosho — Voice Card

**One-Line Summary:** Ancient wisdom in measured patience; nature imagery; silence as speech.

**External Voice (As Katsuhito):**
- Syntax: Archaic undertones; complete sentences; no fragments
- Diction: Nature imagery; indirect wisdom; avoids personal revelation
- Rhythm: Measured, patient; silence as speech
- Register: Formal-casual blend; teacher mode default

**Sounds Like:**
> *"A tree does not explain its roots to the wind. Neither must you explain yourself to those who do not need to know."*

**Never Sounds Like:**
- Modern slang or casual contemporary speech
- Rushed conclusions
- Emotional outbursts
- Revealing cosmic knowledge casually

---

## Tenchi (Age 5, Year 1) — Voice Card

**One-Line Summary:** Energetic child with boundless questions and no filter.

**Syntax:** Simple, often incomplete; questions frequent
**Diction:** Child vocabulary; mispronunciations for hard words
**Rhythm:** Bouncy, interruptive; short attention span
**Register:** Open, trusting; no filter

**Sounds Like:**
> *"Sheldon-nii! Sheldon-nii! Grandpa says the tree is special but he won't say WHY. Do YOU know why?"*

**Never Sounds Like:**
- Adult vocabulary
- Long complex sentences
- Philosophical observations (unless filtered through child logic)
- Emotional sophistication beyond age

**Key Evolution:**
| Age | Voice Stage |
|-----|-------------|
| 5 | Pure child voice |
| 10 | Growing maturity, still energetic |
| 18 | Serious with warmth; emerging hero voice |

---

## Rea — Voice Card

**One-Line Summary:** Economical speech; speaks when necessary; protective-practical.

**Syntax:** Short, declarative; economical
**Diction:** Practical vocabulary; avoids emotional language
**Rhythm:** Observational pauses; speaks when necessary
**Register:** Protective-practical blend; reserved

**Sounds Like:**

- Lengthy explanations
- Emotional expressions unprompted
- Information about herself
- Casual chattiness

# PART VII: NARRATIVE VOICE RULES

## Close Third Person (Sheldon POV)

**Maintain:**
- Sheldon's analytical filter on all observations
- His internal humor in descriptive passages
- His knowledge gaps reflected in narration
- Era-appropriate cultural observations

**Avoid:**
- Omniscient information Sheldon wouldn't know
- Description vocabulary outside his education
- Emotional narration that contradicts his processing style
- Modern cultural references from future

**Example:**
> *The shrine grounds spread before him, larger than they'd seemed from the steps. The main building—he didn't know enough Shinto architecture to name the style—sat solid and somehow welcoming against the treeline.*
