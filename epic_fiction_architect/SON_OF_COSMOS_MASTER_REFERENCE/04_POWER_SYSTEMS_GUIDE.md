# PART I: LAMBDA POWER (Sheldon's Core Ability)

**Source:** lambda_power.md

## 1.1 Canonical Origin (Sailor Moon Manga)

Lambda Power (ラムダ・パワー) manifested when:
1. Eternal Sailor Moon confronted Chaos at the Galaxy Cauldron
2. She called upon ALL Sailor Crystals in the galaxy
3. The Crystals responded and united their power
4. Usagi embraced Chaos rather than destroy it
5. The combined power purified the Cauldron and restored all Star Seeds

**Etymology:**
- Lambda (Λ) = 11th letter of Greek alphabet
- In physics: the Cosmological Constant
- Represents force opposing gravity, creating "static, eternal universe"
- **Thematic Meaning:** Regeneration over destruction, preservation over entropy

## 1.2 What Lambda IS vs IS NOT

**What Lambda IS:**
- Ultimate expression of Silver/Cosmos Crystal lineage
- Power born from selfless love, not combat
- Cosmic-scale healing and restoration
- The opposite of destructive power

**What Lambda is NOT:**
- A combat ability
- Destructive force
- Something used offensively
- Power gained through training alone

## 1.3 Sheldon's Connection: The Resonance Seed

When Cosmos remade Sheldon, she implanted a "Resonance Seed" — a fragment of Lambda essence.

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Source | Gift from Cosmos |
| Nature | Passive/unconscious initially |
| Expression | Healing, nurturing, food enhancement |
| Growth | Develops across 1000-year timeline |

**The Seed is NOT the full Cosmos Crystal** — it's a resonance fragment that carries Lambda's essence.

## 1.4 Five-Phase Progression

| Phase | Years | Calendar | Awareness | Expression |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **I** | 1-3 | 1989-1992 | Unconscious | Passive effects only |
| **II** | 4-12 | 1992-2001 | Awakening | Sensing, minor healing |
| **III** | 13-100 | 2001-2089 | Conscious | Controlled healing, purification |
| **IV** | 100-500 | 2089-2489 | Advanced | Major restoration abilities |
| **V** | 500-1000+ | 2489-2989+ | Mastery | Near-cosmic scale |

## 1.5 Phase I: Dormant (1989-1992) — CURRENT STORY PHASE

**Sheldon CANNOT:**
- Sense supernatural elements deliberately
- Use healing intentionally
- Perceive his own power
- Think about or reference Lambda

**Passive Effects (What Others Notice):**

| Effect | Description | Who Notices |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Food Enhancement | Meals taste better, feel more satisfying | Everyone who eats his cooking |
| Warming Presence | People feel safer, calmer near him | Katsuhito (suspicious), Tenchi (comforted) |
| Emotional Healing | Conversations leave people feeling better | All relationships |
| Physical Resilience | Minor injuries heal faster | Sheldon (rationalizes) |

**How Sheldon Interprets Sensations:**

| Sensation | His Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Unusual energy when cooking | "I must be enjoying this" |
| People reacting warmly | "Japanese hospitality reciprocated" |
| Quick recovery from minor cuts | "I'm younger and healthier now" |
| Sense of purpose in caretaking | "Natural fulfillment" |

## 1.6 Lambda Expressions

### Food That Heals

**Mechanism:** Everything Sheldon cooks carries trace Lambda energy (completely unconscious)

| Recipient | Experience |
|-----------|------------|
| Normal humans | Food tastes exceptional; feel warm and loved |
| Juraians (later) | Sense something unusual; energy resonance |
| Washu (later) | Detects Lambda signature; begins investigation |

### Emotional Resonance (All Phases)

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Comfort presence | People relax around him |
| Conflict de-escalation | Tensions ease when he's involved |
| Trust acceleration | People open up to him faster |
| Emotional healing | Processing grief, trauma easier |

## 1.7 Writing Guidelines for Phase I

**NEVER:**
- Use the word "Lambda" in Sheldon's POV
- Have Sheldon consciously use abilities
- Show Sheldon sensing supernatural elements deliberately
- Reference the Cosmos Crystal or Silver Crystal

**ALWAYS:**
- Show effects others notice (food quality, warmth)
- Have Sheldon rationalize unusual experiences
- Maintain the "normal teenager" test
- Plant seeds for later revelation

**Correct Example:**
> The stew seemed to radiate warmth beyond its temperature. Katsuhito set down his chopsticks, expression thoughtful.

**Incorrect Example:**
> Lambda energy infused the stew, which Katsuhito sensed.

## 1.8 Character Reactions to Lambda

| Character | How They React | What They Think |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Katsuhito | Notices warmth, investigates subtly | "There's something unusual about this boy" |
| Tenchi | Feels safe and happy | "Sheldon-niichan is the best cook!" |
| Nobuyuki | Enjoys meals, appreciates care | "I'm grateful someone's looking after Father" |
| Washu (later) | Detects energy signature | "This requires investigation" |

- Too bright to let go out

**Cosmos's Action:**
- Found him during boundary patrol
- Poured her power into damaged crystal
- Mended fractures, restored coherence
- Rekindled guttering light

**Unintended Consequence:**
- Healing was too complete, too intimate

# PART IV: LIGHT HAWK WINGS (Juraian Power)

**Source:** light_hawk_wings.md

## 4.1 Nature

Light Hawk Wings are "pure energy constructs" — "the bio-energy of the gods" representing tremendous power in the Tenchi Muyo universe.

**Origin:**
- Manifestations of energy from higher dimensions
- Connect physical universe to hyper-dimensional reality
- Only accessible to specific beings or through specific means

## 4.2 Generation Sources

### Divine Sources

| Source | Capability | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Choushin Goddesses | Unlimited | Created the concept |
| Tsunami | 10 Wings | Maximum in normal dimensions |
| Tokimi | Unknown (vast) | Can grant wings to others |
| Washu | Sealed | Powers locked in gems |

### Anomalies

| Being | Wing Count | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Tenchi Masaki | 3-6+ | Natural anomaly, unlimited potential |
| Z | 5 | Granted by Tokimi |
| Kami Tenchi | Unlimited | Transcends the Choushin |

### Royal Tree Ships

| Generation | Capability |
|------------|------------|
| Tsunami-fune | 10 Wings |
| 1st Generation | Independent generation |
| 2nd Generation | Independent generation |
| 3rd Generation+ | Must combine forces |

## 4.3 Energy Requirements (Exponential Scaling)

| Wings | Energy Formula | Relative Power |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | 2^1 - 1 = 1 | Baseline |
| 2 | 2^2 - 1 = 3 | 3x first wing |
| 3 | 2^3 - 1 = 7 | 7x first wing |
| 5 | 2^5 - 1 = 31 | 31x first wing |
| 10 | 2^10 - 1 = 1023 | 1023x first wing |

**Each additional wing requires double the previous wing's energy.**

## 4.4 Capabilities

**Defensive:** Primary function — capable of repelling nearly any attack
**Offensive:** Energy projection, cutting, overwhelming force
**Material Conversion:** Users like Tenchi can convert wing energy into matter (armor, shields, weapons)

## 4.5 Power Scale Reference

| Level | Wing Count | Examples |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Transcendent | Unlimited | Kami Tenchi |
| Divine | 10+ | Choushin, Tsunami-fune |
| Exceptional | 5 | Z |
| Baseline Power | 3 | Tenchi (initial) |
| Combined Gen 3+ | Varies | Fleet ships |

# PART V: ROYAL TREES OF JURAI

**Source:** royal_trees.md

## 5.1 Overview

Royal Trees are sentient, sapient beings created by goddess Tsunami:
- Created ~150,000 years ago
- Each tree is an individual with its own personality
- Serve as foundation of Juraian civilization
- Provide power, extended lifespans, and starship capabilities

## 5.2 Generations

| Generation | Characteristics | Wing Capability |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 0 (Tsunami) | Tsunami-no-ki herself | 10 Wings, universal control |
| 1st | Direct seeds from Tsunami-no-ki, rarest | Independent generation |
| 2nd | Seeds from 1st gen, still extremely powerful | Independent generation |
| 3rd+ | Most common, bulk of Juraian fleet | Must combine forces |

## 5.3 Notable Royal Trees

## 5.4 The Funaho Tree (Story-Critical)

**Location:** Near Masaki Shrine on Earth
**Status:** Dormant, rooted
**Partner:** Yosho/Katsuhito
**Named after:** Yosho's mother

**CRITICAL:** Katsuhito generates BARRIERS through Funaho, NOT Light Hawk Wings directly.

# PART VII: LAMBDA VS. OTHER POWER SYSTEMS

## 7.1 Lambda vs. Light Hawk Wings

| Lambda (Sailor Moon) | Light Hawk Wings (Tenchi Muyo) |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Regenerative/healing | Offensive/defensive |
| Passive expression | Active manifestation |
| Based on love/hope | Based on will/potential |
| From external cosmology | From Chousin experiment |
| Sheldon's power | Tenchi's power |

## 7.2 Why Chousin Notice Lambda

The Chousin (Washu, Tsunami, Tokimi) notice Sheldon because:

1. **External Origin:** Lambda didn't come from their creation
2. **Quality Match:** Craftsmanship rivals their own work
3. **Unknown Creator:** They cannot identify Cosmos
4. **Clear Purpose:** Sheldon's role (caretaking) is obvious, unlike their experiments

## 7.3 Chousin Conference Result (Year 13+)

- **WASHU:** "Someone else has been playing in our sandbox."
- **TSUNAMI:** "I sense... kinship? But not from us."
- **TOKIMI:** "This is outside our experiment parameters."

**Verdict:** Sheldon classified as "Protected Anomaly" — observe but do not interfere

---

# PART VIII: POWER HIERARCHY REFERENCE

## 8.1 Complete Power Scale

| Tier | Examples | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Transcendent | Kami Tenchi | Beyond Choushin |
| Divine | Choushin (Washu, Tsunami, Tokimi), Cosmos | Universe-scale |
| High Divine | Sailor Cosmos (manifested) | Low multiverse |
| Maximum Conventional | Tsunami-fune, 10-wing capable | Dimensional limit |
| Exceptional | Z (5 wings), Tenchi (full power) | Above normal limits |
| High | 1st/2nd gen tree partners, Ryoko | Independent LHW generation |
| Combat Enhanced | GP officers, Juraian nobles | Superhuman |
| Lambda Phase V | Sheldon (far future) | Near-cosmic healing |
| Lambda Phase III | Sheldon (Year 13-100) | Controlled abilities |
| Lambda Phase I | Sheldon (current) | Passive effects only |
| Enhanced Human | Body enhancement recipients | ~2,000 year lifespan |
| Baseline Human | Normal Earth humans | No enhancement |

## 8.2 Sheldon's Position

**Current (Phase I):** Presents as "gifted human" — exceptional but explainable
**Year 13 (Phase III):** Will be detected by Chousin as anomalous
**Phase V (far future):** Approaches cosmic-scale healing

**Key:** Sheldon is NOT a warrior. His power is nurturing, not combat.

# APPENDIX: FORBIDDEN TERMINOLOGY BY PHASE

## Phase I (Years 1-3) — NEVER USE in Sheldon's POV:

| Term | Why Forbidden |
|------|---------------|
| Lambda | Core power name |
| Resonance Seed | His Lambda fragment |
| Cosmos Crystal | Source of Lambda |
| Silver Crystal | Predecessor |
| Galaxy Cauldron | Where Lambda activated |
| Phase I/II/III | Story terminology |
| Chousin | Unknown to him |
| Light Hawk Wings | Unknown to him |
| Jurai/Juraian | Unknown to him |

## Acceptable References:

- "That cave by the lake" (not "Ryoko's cave")
- "The big tree" (not "Funaho")
- "Warmth in his chest" (the bond)
- "Unusual energy" (vague sensing)
- "Grandpa seems young for his age" (not "700-year-old Juraian")
