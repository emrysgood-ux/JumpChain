# PART V: PLANTING GUIDELINES

## 5.1 Seed Introduction Protocol

When planting a new seed:
1. **First mention:** Notable but not heavy-handed
2. **Sensory grounding:** Attach to sight, sound, smell, touch
3. **Emotional context:** Connect to character's feelings
4. **Documentation:** Add to this registry immediately

## 5.2 Reinforcement Protocol

For established seeds:
- Minimum 3 uses before "counts" as established
- Each use should add slight variation
- Space appropriately (not clustering)
- Connect to different contexts to build layers

## 5.3 Harvest Protocol

When paying off a seed:
- Explicit or implicit connection to journey
- Emotional resonance with reader expectation
- Does not require "explaining" the seed
- May transform rather than end (for ongoing stories)
