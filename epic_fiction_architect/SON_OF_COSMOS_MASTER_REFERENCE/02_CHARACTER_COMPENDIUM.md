| **Birth Date (Tsukino ID)** | March 15, 1959 (making him 30 in 1989) |

### 1.2 Education & Career

**CRITICAL:** Sheldon is a legitimate GENIUS. Four PhDs is not a quirky character detail — it's who he IS.

| Degree | Institution | Field | Year |
|--------|-------------|-------|------|
| PhD #1 | MIT | Physics | ~1994 |
| PhD #2 | Stanford | Applied Mathematics | ~2009 |
| PhD #3 | Caltech | Materials Science | ~2015 |

| Postdoc | Kyoto University | Physics Research | ~2010 |

### 1.3 Family Background

**Father:** Marcus Carter — died when Sheldon was 9 (industrial accident)
**Mother:** Evelyn Carter — died when Sheldon was 12 (cancer)
**Grandmother:** Dorothy Mae Washington — raised him ages 10-22; died 2009

### 1.4 Dorothy Mae's Core Teachings

**The Handkerchief Rule:**
> "A gentleman keeps a handkerchief. You never know when you'll need to wipe your face or help a lady with her tears or clean up a mess."

**The Self-Sufficiency Mandate:**
> "A man who can't feed himself isn't a man at all."

**The Survival Priorities:**
> "Water, food, shelter. In that order. Everything else can wait."

**The Work Ethic:**
> "Idle hands are the devil's workshop. If you don't have work, find some."

**The Hospitality Rule:**
> "When someone opens their home to you, you don't sit there like furniture. You help. You contribute."

**The Pride Warning:**
> "Don't let those white boys make you feel small. And don't let them make you feel big, either. Pride goes before a fall."

### 1.5 The Tsukino Identity

**CRITICAL:** Cosmos rewrote causality — the Tsukino family genuinely exists and Sheldon is genuinely their descendant.

**Tsukino Family (Cosmos-Created):**
- **Takeo (Grandfather):** Born 1925, died 1978 (heart attack)
- **Yuki (Mother):** Born 1940, died 1985 (cancer) — married American serviceman
- **James Carter (Father):** Born 1932, died 1982 — US Air Force, then mechanic
- **Kiyoshi (Uncle):** Born 1935, ALIVE in Osaka — will recognize Sheldon

### 1.6 Death Circumstances (2025)

**Location:** Alaska, Particle Accelerator Laboratory
**Cause:** Cascade failure during final calibrations — containment systems failed
**Final moment:** Recognition, not fear — a quiet 'oh' — acceptance rather than panic
**Witness:** Maria Chen-Vasquez (colleague, present at controls)

### 1.7 Physical Restoration

Cosmos restored Sheldon to optimal physical condition:
- Vision corrected (no longer needs glasses)
- Heart rhythm normalized
- Back pain eliminated
- Arthritis gone
- Scar from childhood knife accident erased
- Body age: approximately 22-23

### 1.8 Arrival Inventory (April 3, 1989)

**Clothing:** Gray slacks, white button-down, black belt, black oxfords
**Wallet Contents:**
- Japanese Residence Card (永住者 - Permanent Resident)
- ¥50,000 cash
- Koseki excerpt (family registry)
- Letter from Uncle Kiyoshi
- Family photograph (1977)
- Two bankbooks (total ¥797,000)

**Personal Items:**
- Seiko watch (mechanical, wound and running)
- White cotton handkerchief (Dorothy Mae's standard)
- Loose change (¥470)

### 1.9 Media Consumption & Tenchi Knowledge

**Sailor Moon:** Knows it (cultural osmosis) — recognizes "Tsukino" as the protagonist's surname
**Tenchi Muyo:** Watched casually, DROPPED due to harem dynamics — remembers maybe 1-2 names vaguely

**CRITICAL:** Sheldon has NO meta-knowledge advantage for Tenchi Muyo. He does NOT recognize Masaki Shrine, Katsuhito, the cave, Funaho tree, or ANY plot details until Year 13 when Ryoko awakens.

### 1.10 Voice Profile

**Internal Narration:**
- Syntax: Complex sentences with embedded clauses; scientific precision
- Diction: Academic vocabulary deployed unconsciously; self-deprecating humor
- Rhythm: Analytical, observational pauses; quick pivots to humor
- Imagery: Scientific metaphors, cooking comparisons, occasional cosmic wonder

**Example:**
> *"The probability of landing in a timeline where his fabricated documents would hold up to scrutiny was... actually, he had no idea. Statistics required data. He had memories, a wallet, and what appeared to be very convincing fingerprints."*

**External Dialogue (Phase I):**
- Shorter, more controlled than thoughts
- Deliberately simpler; hiding education
- Careful, measured; pauses before revelations
- Deferential to Katsuhito; warm to Tenchi; cautious to strangers

**Example:**
> "I don't know where I came from. But I can work. If you'll let me stay."

### 1.11 Technology Ethics

**Principle 1:** Help When You Can
- Will use his knowledge to improve lives
- Medical advances, clean energy, agriculture, communication

**Principle 2:** Do No Harm
- NEVER weapons technology
- NEVER mass surveillance
- NEVER technology that concentrates destructive power
- Nothing that accelerates conflict or enables tyranny

**The Work Required:**
Any technology introduction requires building tools to build tools to build tools. Much of what he knows is still science fiction TODAY because the infrastructure doesn't exist.

# PART II: MASAKI HOUSEHOLD (Pre-Canon)

## 2. KATSUHITO/YOSHO MASAKI

**Source:** katsuhito.md, psychological_states.md

### 2.1 Core Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **True Name** | Yosho Masaki Jurai, Crown Prince |
| **Public Name** | Katsuhito Masaki |
| **Age** | ~730 years (arrived Earth 1292 AD) |
| **Species** | Juraian (humanoid) |
| **Royal Tree** | Funaho (1st generation, rooted at shrine) |
| **Story Role** | Sheldon's eventual romantic partner (slow-burn decades) |

**CRITICAL:** Yosho generates BARRIERS through Funaho, NOT Light Hawk Wings.

### 2.2 Physical Appearance (Illusion)

What Sheldon sees — the elderly priest illusion:
- **Apparent age:** Late 60s to early 70s
- **Height:** ~170 cm (5'7") — slightly stooped
- **Build:** Lean, wiry; looks like lifetime of physical work
- **Hair:** Gray, shoulder-length, tied back; receding at temples
- **Face:** Weathered, lined; kind eyes behind round glasses
- **Voice:** Low, measured, unhurried; Okayama accent softened

**All of this is ILLUSION. True form is young adult Juraian prince.**

### 2.3 Psychological Profile

**Formative Psychology (Canon):**
> "Yosho was sober and thoughtful from childhood, as a result of feeling responsible for helping his mother Funaho survive Juraian society and politics."

**Why He Left Jurai:**
1. Unrequited love for Misaki (stepmother) — painful, inappropriate
2. True love for Airi — politically impossible
3. Refusal to marry Ayeka — loved her as sister, not wife
4. Escape from court life — exhausted by hiding emotions
5. Self-exile from identity — the prince could die; Katsuhito could live

**The Mortality Policy:**
Yosho and wife Kasumi decided their descendants should not be forced to live extended lives. He has watched:
- Kasumi die at 138 (she was "disturbed with her extended life")
- Daughter Kiyone die at 248 (she chose mortality)

### 2.4 April 1989 State

A 730-year-old man who has:
- Buried his first wife
- Buried his daughter
- Hidden his true identity for 700 years
- Maintained an open marriage across light-years (with Airi)
- Watched descendants choose mortality rather than accept his gift
- Raised his great-great-grandson alone after another loss

**Coping Mechanisms:**
- "His patience is grief made functional"
- Shrine duties provide structure
- Hidden spiritual practice with Funaho tree
- Observes more than speaks
- Guards secrets — the death script, his identity, family connections

### 2.5 First Meeting with Sheldon

**When Sheldon arrives (~4:52 PM):**
- Katsuhito is sweeping the courtyard
- He heard footsteps from step ~250; has been waiting
- First words: "You climbed all the way up." — statement, not question

**What He Perceives:**
- Immediately obvious: Foreign, exhausted, young (30ish), city clothes
- Interesting: Japanese is fluent — educated speech patterns
- Concerning: Energy signature is WRONG — Lambda resonance he shouldn't have

**Inner Assessment:**
> "This person is not what he appears to be. Requires careful observation."

### 2.6 Voice Profile

**As Katsuhito:**
- Archaic undertones; complete sentences; no fragments
- Nature imagery; indirect wisdom; avoids personal revelation
- Measured, patient; silence as speech

**Example:**
> "A tree does not explain its roots to the wind. Neither must you explain yourself to those who do not need to know."

**NEVER sounds like:**
- Modern slang
- Rushed conclusions
- Emotional outbursts
- Casually revealing cosmic knowledge

## 3. TENCHI MASAKI

**Source:** tenchi.md, psychological_states.md

### 3.1 Core Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Birthday** | April 24, 1984 |
| **Age at Story Start** | 4 (turns 5 on Day 22) |
| **Mother** | Kiyone MASAKI (NOT Achika) — deceased ~1987 |
| **Father** | Nobuyuki Masaki — works in city; visits weekends |
| **Adopted Sister** | Rea Masaki (~15-17) — primary caretaker |
| **Grandfather** | Katsuhito / Prince Yosho |

### 3.2 Physical Description (Age 4)

- **Height:** ~100 cm (~3'3")
- **Build:** Small, healthy; baby fat still in cheeks
- **Hair:** Black, straight, bowl cut; tends to stick up in back
- **Eyes:** Dark brown, large, expressive
- **Expression:** Open, curious, unguarded

### 3.3 Personality

**Core traits:**
- Curious and friendly — approaches strangers without fear
- Typical 4-year-old energy; alternates between intense activity and sudden tiredness
- Speaks clearly but with childish grammar; says "nande?" (why?) constantly
- Very close to grandfather; misses father
- Doesn't remember mother

**Fears:** Dark (uses nightlight); being alone; the cave grandfather forbade

**Loves:** Grandfather's stories; playing outside; helping with shrine chores; anime on TV

### 3.4 The Mother Loss

**Canon:** Kiyone died when Tenchi was still a young boy (age 2-3)

**The Memory Confusion:**
> "When Tenchi finds out that all the positive memories he attributes to his mother were actually just him superimposing Kiyone's image onto Rea's actions, he realizes he hated his real mother enough that he effectively erased her from his mind."

At age 4, Tenchi has fragmentary "memories" of his mother. Many are actually memories of Rea caring for him. His brain has merged the two.

### 3.5 The Death Script

**What Tenchi Believes:**
- His mother died in some dramatic way (fake stories)
- "Mama is in heaven" — grandfather's explanation

**What He Doesn't Know:**
- The stories are fabricated
- His mother was 248 years old
- His mother was half-alien
- His entire family history is hidden

### 3.6 Primary Caretakers

1. **Katsuhito:** Daytime supervision, guidance, stories
2. **Rea ("Rea-nee"):** Meals, bath, bedtime routine, emotional nurturing
3. **Nobuyuki:** Weekend excitement, but inconsistent presence

### 3.7 Voice Profile

- **Syntax:** Simple, often incomplete; questions frequent
- **Diction:** Child vocabulary; mispronunciations for hard words
- **Rhythm:** Bouncy, interruptive; short attention span
- **Register:** Open, trusting; no filter

**Example:**
> "Sheldon-nii! Sheldon-nii! Grandpa says the tree is special but he won't say WHY. Do YOU know why?"

**NEVER sounds like:**
- Adult vocabulary
- Long complex sentences
- Philosophical observations (unless filtered through child logic)
- Emotional sophistication beyond age

## 4. NOBUYUKI MASAKI

**Source:** nobuyuki.md, psychological_states.md

### 4.1 Core Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | 正木 信之 (Masaki Nobuyuki) |
| **Age in 1989** | ~120 years old (appears mid-30s) |
| **Occupation** | Architect at Kurashiki-based firm |
| **Residence** | Weekdays: apartment in Kurashiki; Weekends: shrine |
| **Marital Status** | Widower — wife Kiyone died ~1986-1987 |

### 4.2 The Masaki Paradox (Canon)

Nobuyuki is BOTH:
1. Yosho's descendant — Multiple generations removed
2. Yosho's son-in-law — Married Kiyone, who was Yosho's daughter

Yosho is simultaneously Nobuyuki's ancestor AND father-in-law.

### 4.3 Physical Description

- **Height:** 5'10" (178 cm)
- **Build:** Slim, slightly soft from desk work
- **Hair:** Black, neatly combed; no gray despite age
- **Face:** Pleasant, open; wire-framed glasses; smile doesn't always reach eyes
- **Voice:** Warm baritone; professional polish; softens around Tenchi

### 4.4 The Kiyone Relationship

**The Courtship (Canon):**
> "Kiyone would spend time and play with him, but would also perform cruel pranks on him regularly. She nicknamed him 'Nobu.'"

> "Via Nobuyuki's journals... Kiyone inflicted 'psychological terror' in their relationship."

> "When he grew up, he surprised Kiyone and the Masaki Village by proposing to her... the villagers actually wondered if he had some sort of brain damage."

**Her Death:** ~1986-1987; natural aging at age 248 (she chose mortality)

**Death Script:** Co-written by Kiyone and her mother Airi — fake stories about her death for Tenchi. Nobuyuki must perform these stories.

### 4.5 Grief and Coping

- Doesn't talk about Kiyone
- Keeps her photo in wallet
- Can't look at wedding photo
- Hides grief behind comedy — perverted jokes are armor
- Only Yosho sees through his mask

### 4.6 Weekend Pattern

- Arrives Friday ~7 PM; first thing hugs Tenchi
- Saturdays: Takes Tenchi on outings
- Sundays: Helps with shrine; departs ~4 PM
- Last thing hugs Tenchi longer

### 4.7 Relationship with Sheldon

**First Encounter:** Day 6 — Returns for weekend to find stranger at shrine
**Day 20 Statement:** "My father's judgment is sound." — Trust extended
**Internal Observation:** "Something I can't see" — notices strangeness, doesn't push

## 5. REA MASAKI

**Source:** rea.md, psychological_states.md

### 5.1 Core Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | 柾木 玲亜 (Rea Masaki) |
| **True Origin** | Geminar (alternate dimension); artificial human |
| **Age in 1989** | ~15-17 years old |
| **Status** | High school student; manages household |
| **Relation to Tenchi** | Adopted sister |

### 5.2 Physical Description

- **Height:** 5'2" (158 cm)
- **Build:** Slender, youthful
- **Hair:** Light brown, medium length
- **Eyes:** Brown
- **Appearance:** Ordinary Japanese teenager; nothing suggests artificial origins

### 5.3 Origin: The Geminar Connection

Rea was one of three preteen-aged artificial humans created on Geminar to pilot Seikijin (bio-mechanical battle units).

**The Accident:**
- She was fascinated with "the other world" (Earth)
- During equipment testing, dimensional transfer accidentally triggered
- She arrived as a preteen in a field near Okayama, ~1984
- Kiyone Masaki found and adopted her

### 5.4 The Command Programming (Canon)

> "She immediately became bound by the unbreakable orders to mate with a human male and produce an offspring to be sent back to Geminar to defeat Gaia."

> "If Rea attempted to 'not' complete the mission... she would be killed by the failsafes built into her body."

This programming affects her emotional processing. She may not fully feel fear/anxiety the way humans do.

### 5.5 Daily Schedule (1989)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:30 AM | Wake; prepare breakfast |
| 6:30 AM | Breakfast with household |
| 7:00 AM | Prepare Tenchi for kindergarten |
| 7:30 AM | Leave for school |
| 4:00 PM | Return home |
| 4:30 PM | Begin dinner preparations |
| 6:00 PM | Dinner |
| 7:00 PM | Homework; help Tenchi with bath |
| 8:00 PM | Tenchi to bed |
| 10:00 PM | Sleep |

### 5.6 Psychological State

- Lost Kiyone-oneesama (only confidant) ~2 years ago
- Carries programming she cannot override
- May have dampened emotional responses
- Functions as Tenchi's de facto mother at age 15-17
- Knows she's "different" but doesn't understand why

### 5.7 Voice Profile

- **Syntax:** Short, declarative; economical
- **Diction:** Practical vocabulary; avoids emotional language
- **Rhythm:** Observational pauses; speaks when necessary
- **Register:** Protective-practical blend; reserved

**Example:**
> "He's in the kitchen. Been there since dawn." [Pause] "He made extra."

**NEVER sounds like:**
- Lengthy explanations
- Emotional expressions unprompted
- Information about herself
- Casual chattiness

### 5.8 Story Integration

**Day 1:** Rea is NOT present when Sheldon arrives (~4:52 PM) — she's at school. Returns ~5:30-6:00 PM.

**Dynamic with Sheldon:** Potential tension — she's been THE caretaker, and Sheldon disrupts her role. Initially wary; may warm as she sees he's genuinely helpful.

**Future (Canon):** Rea eventually marries Nobuyuki; they have son Kenshi who is sent to Geminar.

## 6. KIYONE MASAKI (Deceased)

**Source:** kiyone_masaki.md, psychological_states.md

*Included because her psychological imprint shapes the entire household.*

### 6.1 Core Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Full Name** | Kiyone Masaki |
| **Age at Death** | 248 years old |
| **Species** | Half-Juraian |
| **Death** | ~1986-1987 |

### 6.2 Personality (Canon)

> "Incredibly mischievous and even slightly sadistic."
> "A hellion during childhood — no one could control her."
> "Lunatic who loved to write 'idiot' on people's heads."

Pranks were her love language. She showed affection through torment.

### 6.3 The Death Script

Before her death, Kiyone created an elaborate, darkly humorous script instructing her family how to inform Tenchi of her passing (co-written with her mother Airi).

**Why She Did This:**
1. Control — Couldn't control dying; controlled the narrative
2. Protection — Truth would reveal family secrets too early
3. Love — Pranks were her love language; this IS how she says goodbye
4. Legacy — Wanted to be remembered as herself, not as tragedy

### 6.4 The Rea Secret

> "Kiyone never told a single other person about it [Rea's origin] before dying."

She was the ONLY person who knew Rea's true nature. Her death left Rea's secret orphaned.

### 6.5 Her Ghost in the Household

- Photos throughout the house
- Her garden remains unfinished
- Her cooking style lives through Rea
- Her pranks echo in family stories (that Tenchi believes are real)
- Her death script still shapes what Tenchi knows

- Comparison: Nothing in 20,000-year database matches

**Chousin Conference Result:**
- WASHU: "Someone else has been playing in our sandbox."
- TSUNAMI: "I sense... kinship? But not from us."
- TOKIMI: "This is outside our experiment parameters."

**Verdict:** Sheldon classified as "Protected Anomaly" — observe but do not interfere

# PART VI: HOUSEHOLD PSYCHOLOGICAL DYNAMICS

**Source:** psychological_states.md

## 13. The Household Emotional System

**Core Dynamic:** A household of isolated grief — functioning on the surface, fragmented underneath. Each person holds significant pain alone while maintaining daily routines.

**Communication Pattern:** Much is left unsaid. The death script lies about Kiyone. Yosho's thoughts are private. Nobuyuki doesn't discuss feelings. Rea doesn't voice needs. Tenchi asks "nande?" but gets incomplete answers.

**The Vacuum Sheldon Enters:** Four people who need connection but have learned to cope through isolation, competence, or deflection.

## 14. The Grief Topology

```
YOSHO: grief expressed as patience, observation
       (buried Kasumi, buried Kiyone, guards secrets)

NOBUYUKI: grief expressed as jokes, work, distance
          (lost wife, performs death script, absent)

REA: grief expressed as competence, suppression
     (lost Kiyone-oneesama, carries secret alone)

TENCHI: grief expressed as attachment hunger, questions
        (lost mother at 2-3, confused memories)
```

## 15. The Secret Topology

| Secret | Who Knows | Who Doesn't |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Kiyone's death was natural aging at 248 | Yosho, Nobuyuki, Airi, Tennyo | Tenchi, Rea |
| The death script stories are fabricated | Yosho, Nobuyuki, Airi, Tennyo | Tenchi |
| Yosho is actually Prince Yosho of Jurai | Yosho, Nobuyuki, Airi | Tenchi, Rea |
| Rea is an artificial human from Geminar | Rea only | Everyone else |
| The family has galactic connections | Adults | Tenchi |

## 16. What Sheldon Disrupts

**The Isolation Equilibrium:**
- Each person has found a way to cope alone
- Sheldon's arrival forces interaction
- A stranger who STAYS changes household dynamics

**Therapeutic Opportunities:**
- **For Yosho:** Intellectual companionship; permission to be more than mask
- **For Nobuyuki:** Witness to grief without needing jokes
- **For Rea:** Another adult sharing burden; recognition as person not function
- **For Tenchi:** Reliable nurturing adult; play companionship
