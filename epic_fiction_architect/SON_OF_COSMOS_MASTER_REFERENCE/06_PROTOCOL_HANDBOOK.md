**Source:** dialogue_texture_protocol.md

## 2.1 Exposition Management

### Exposition Limits
| Scene Type | Maximum Exposition % | Method |
|------------|---------------------|--------|
| Action | 10% | Interruptions, physical reactions |
| Dialogue-heavy | 30% | Break with action beats |
| Introspective | 50% | Internal monologue balance |

### Information Delivery Techniques
1. **Salami Slicing:** Reveal information across multiple exchanges
2. **Interruption:** Cut exposition with action or another speaker
3. **Implication:** Let readers infer from context
4. **Conflict Embedding:** Deliver info through argument/disagreement
5. **Question Redirection:** Answer questions with questions

### Forbidden Patterns
- "As you know, Bob..." constructions
- Characters explaining things they both already know
- Uninterrupted monologues exceeding 100 words
- Perfect recall of past events verbatim

## 2.2 Rhythm and Pacing

### Beat Structure
Every dialogue exchange should contain:
- **Action beats** (physical movement/gesture) every 3-5 lines
- **Pause beats** (silence, hesitation) at emotional peaks
- **Environmental beats** (setting reminders) every page

### Sentence Length by Emotional State
| State | Length | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Calm | Medium (10-20 words) | Standard dialogue |
| Tense | Short (1-8 words) | "No. Not yet. Wait." |
| Reflective | Long (20-30 words) | Extended metaphors |
| Interrupted | Incomplete | "I was going to—" |

## 2.3 Cultural Authenticity (1989 Rural Okayama)

### Honorific Quick Reference
