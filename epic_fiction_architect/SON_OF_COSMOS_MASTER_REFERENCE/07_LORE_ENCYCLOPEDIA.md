# PART I: COSMOLOGY

## 1.1 The Choushin (Creator Goddesses)

The Choushin are "a trio of super-dimensional deities responsible for the creation of the multiverse and all of the higher dimensions of existence."

### The Three Sisters

| Sister | Domain | Current Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Washu** (Eldest) | Science/Matter | Living as mortal scientist; powers sealed in gems |
| **Tsunami** (Middle) | Life/Spirit | Merged with Sasami Masaki Jurai |
| **Tokimi** (Youngest) | Space/Dimension | Watching over Tenchi's family |

### Their Quest
- Spent billions of years searching for a being greater than themselves
- The Answer: **Kami Tenchi** — Tenchi Masaki manifested power beyond the Choushin
- Tenchi exists as both mortal and something transcendent

### Power Hierarchy

| Level | Being(s) | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Kami Tenchi | Transcends the Choushin |
| 2 | Choushin (3 sisters) | Created everything else |
| 3 | Counter-Actor (Misaki) | Balancing force |
| 4 | Tenchi (physical) | Connected to level 1 |
| 5 | Z, empowered anomalies | Granted by Choushin |
| 6 | Tsunami-fune (10 LHW) | Maximum conventional |
| 7 | Everything else | Created beings |

## 1.2 The Sailor Moon Cosmology (Sheldon's Origin)

### Sailor Cosmos
- Guardian of the Galaxy Cauldron
- Embodiment of all Sailor Guardians who ever were or will be
- Power tier: Low Multiverse level
- Was human once, transformed long ago

### Lambda Power Origin
Lambda Power (ラムダ・パワー) manifested when Eternal Sailor Moon:
1. Confronted Chaos at the Galaxy Cauldron
2. Called upon ALL Sailor Crystals in the galaxy
3. Embraced Chaos rather than destroy it
4. The combined power purified the Cauldron

### The Crossover
- Cosmos noticed Sheldon's star seed dying at the Cauldron's edge
- She saved him, accidentally creating an eternal mother-son bond
- She placed him in the Tenchi Muyo universe for a peaceful life
- **She did not realize it was a "harem anime"** — a source of comedy

## 3.2 Phase I Dramatic Irony Structure

## 3.3 Irony Maintenance Rules

### NEVER Reveal Prematurely:
1. Sheldon cannot think forbidden words
2. Sheldon cannot consciously perceive supernatural elements
3. Sheldon cannot deduce cosmic truths from evidence
4. Reader hints must be SUBTLE — body language, environment, NOT internal monologue

### Acceptable Tension-Building:
1. Sheldon notices oddities but rationalizes them
2. Reader sees what Sheldon misses
3. Near-misses (almost discovering truth)
4. Other characters' knowing looks (from their POV only)
