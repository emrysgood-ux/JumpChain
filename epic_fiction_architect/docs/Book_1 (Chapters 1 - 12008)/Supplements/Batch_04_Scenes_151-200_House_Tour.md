# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## SHELDON TSUKINO POV
### Batch 4: Scenes 151-200 (14:41-18:00)
## **Tsukino House Tour - Architect's Assessment**

---

## SCENE 151 | 14:41 | Shrine Grounds - Exit Path
**Type:** Main Plot

The expedition began at the torii, the afternoon light golden through spring canopy.

Tenchi led, small legs setting ambitious pace. Nobuyuki followed, architect's eye already cataloging the environment.

---

## SCENE 152 | 14:45 | Shrine Grounds - Exit Path
**Type:** Worldbuilding

"The path continues beyond the shrine?" Nobuyuki asked.

"To the Tsukino property. Perhaps fifteen minutes' walk through the forest."

"I didn't know there was anything back there."

---

## SCENE 153 | 14:49 | Forest Path - Upper
**Type:** Character Development

The admission revealed how little Nobuyuki knew of the mountain's geography beyond the shrine.

Visits focused on Tenchi, not exploration.

---

## SCENE 154 | 14:53 | Forest Path - Middle
**Type:** Main Plot

The path narrowed, required single file. Tenchi bounced between roots, the terrain familiar from previous visits.

"This way! This way!"

---

## SCENE 155 | 14:57 | Forest Path - Middle
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The child had been here several times now—visiting while he worked, exploring while he rested.

The property becoming shared ground.

---

## SCENE 156 | 15:01 | Forest Path - Stream Approach
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The stream announced itself through sound before sight—the particular music of water over stone.

"Careful at the crossing," Sheldon cautioned.

---

## SCENE 157 | 15:05 | Forest Path - Stream Crossing
**Type:** Relationship

Tenchi navigated the stepping stones with practiced confidence. Nobuyuki followed more carefully, the architect testing stability.

"The stones are secure?"

"I reset them myself. They won't shift."

---

## SCENE 158 | 15:09 | Forest Path - Lower
**Type:** Main Plot

The forest opened ahead—the Tsukino clearing visible through the trees.

"There it is," Tenchi announced unnecessarily. "Sheldon-san's house!"

---

## SCENE 159 | 15:13 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Character Development

Nobuyuki stopped at the tree line, taking in the full view.

The house in its current state—weathered but dignified, the cart outside, the garden overgrown, the outbuilding visible beyond.

---

## SCENE 160 | 15:17 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The architect's assessment had begun—the professional evaluation evident in how his eyes tracked structural elements, foundation lines, roof angles.

Judgment being formed.

---

## SCENE 161 | 15:21 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

"Traditional construction," Nobuyuki observed. "Minka-style, probably pre-Meiji."

"I estimated late Edo period. The joinery suggests pre-industrial techniques."

---

## SCENE 162 | 15:25 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Worldbuilding

"The roof is compromised."

"Significantly. A specialist is coming next week for full assessment. The visible damage suggests extensive internal deterioration."

---

## SCENE 163 | 15:29 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Subplot

Tenchi had already run to the cart, examining the repaired wheel.

"This is the wheel Yamada-san fixed!"

"Yes. All four wheels work now."

---

## SCENE 164 | 15:33 | Tsukino House - Genkan
**Type:** Main Plot

"May I see inside?"

"Of course. Watch the flooring—some areas are unstable."

The entry examined with professional attention—the aged timber, the worn threshold, the particular patina of a century's use.

---

## SCENE 165 | 15:37 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Character Development

Nobuyuki moved slowly through the space, attention cataloging everything.

"The frame is sound. Post-and-beam construction, properly executed. The degradation is surface level—weathering, not structural failure."

---

## SCENE 166 | 15:41 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The assessment aligned with his own conclusions, professionally confirmed.

"That was my evaluation as well. The bones are good; the flesh needs restoration."

---

## SCENE 167 | 15:45 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Worldbuilding

"Original features?"

"Most appear intact. The irori, the tokonoma, the shoji frames. Preservation rather than modernization seems appropriate."

---

## SCENE 168 | 15:49 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Main Plot

Nobuyuki touched a post, feeling the wood's texture. "Cedar. Old-growth, from the density. They built with materials we can't replicate now."

"Which argues for preservation."

"Strongly."

---

## SCENE 169 | 15:53 | Tsukino House - Kitchen Area
**Type:** Relationship

The kitchen received similar attention—the cooking area, the storage, the water damage where the roof had failed.

"This section needs complete renovation. The floor joists show moisture damage."

---

## SCENE 170 | 15:57 | Tsukino House - Kitchen Area
**Type:** Character Development

"I planned to address that after the roof. The leak source eliminated before the damage repaired."

"Correct sequencing. Many people make the mistake of cosmetic work first."

The professional approval registered.

---

## SCENE 171 | 16:01 | Tsukino House - Rear Area
**Type:** Subplot

Tenchi explored independently, small footsteps marking progress through the space.

"This house is big!"

"It will feel bigger when it's properly lit and heated."

---

## SCENE 172 | 16:05 | Tsukino House - Bedroom Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The sleeping areas examined—the tatami long gone, the flooring exposed.

"New tatami throughout will be significant cost."

"I've anticipated that. The priority sequence addresses structure first, comfort after."

---

## SCENE 173 | 16:09 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The engawa—the covered porch encircling the main structure.

"The engawa boards are original?"

"Most. Some replacement needed where moisture penetrated. The posts supporting it are sound."

---

## SCENE 174 | 16:13 | Tsukino House - Engawa
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The evaluation continued, Nobuyuki's respect for the structure evident in his careful attention.

The architect saw what others might miss—the quality beneath the decay.

---

## SCENE 175 | 16:17 | Tsukino House - Exterior North
**Type:** Main Plot

The exterior circuit revealed the full scope of the roof damage—the northern exposure having received the worst weathering.

"The thatch specialists work in phases?"

"Typically. This scale would require full replacement."

---

## SCENE 176 | 16:21 | Tsukino House - Exterior North
**Type:** Character Development

"Expensive."

"Yes. But the alternative is continued deterioration. The house deserves proper restoration."

---

## SCENE 177 | 16:25 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

The outbuilding examined—his workshop, the bench and tools visible through the door.

"You've been working here?"

"It served as staging area for the puzzle box construction."

---

## SCENE 178 | 16:29 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Nobuyuki examined the workspace, the tools, the evidence of recent use.

"Organized. Methodical. You approach work systematically."

"Chaos wastes energy."

---

## SCENE 179 | 16:33 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The garden remained the final survey item—overgrown, hints of former structure visible beneath.

"The garden was formal?"

"Japanese style, I believe. Rock placements suggest intentional design. Restoration after the house stabilizes."

---

## SCENE 180 | 16:37 | Tsukino House - Garden Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Tenchi had found a stick, was drawing patterns in exposed dirt.

Birthday exploration expanding to include property imagination.

---

## SCENE 181 | 16:41 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Relationship

"This is a significant undertaking," Nobuyuki said, summary forming. "Months of work, substantial investment, considerable skill required."

"Yes."

"And you intend to do most of it yourself."

"With professional assistance where needed."

---

## SCENE 182 | 16:45 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Character Development

"The puzzle box demonstrated capability. This demonstrates ambition."

"Or stubbornness. The distinction isn't always clear."

A small smile from Nobuyuki. "My wife would have said the same thing about her gardens."

---

## SCENE 183 | 16:49 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Main Plot

The first personal reference to Kiyone that felt comfortable rather than weighted.

Progress, perhaps.

---

## SCENE 184 | 16:53 | Tsukino House - Exterior
**Type:** Subplot

"I should warn you—Japanese building codes apply even to rural restoration. Permits may be required for structural work."

"I've considered that. The local office seems... flexible about historical preservation."

---

## SCENE 185 | 16:57 | Tsukino House - Hokora
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Movement toward the hokora—the small shrine at the property's corner.

"A family shrine?"

"For the Tsukino ancestors. I've maintained it since arriving."

---

## SCENE 186 | 17:01 | Tsukino House - Hokora
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The connection to others' ancestors felt less strange than it should—the maintenance a natural extension of property stewardship.

---

## SCENE 187 | 17:05 | Tsukino House - Hokora
**Type:** Main Plot

Nobuyuki observed the offerings—fresh water, clean surroundings.

"You care for a family that isn't yours."

"They cared for this land. The land cares for me. The relationship seems reciprocal."

---

## SCENE 188 | 17:09 | Tsukino House - Hokora
**Type:** Character Development

The explanation satisfied or at least sufficed.

Nobuyuki's evaluation continued accumulating data, the judgment not yet complete but trending positive.

---

## SCENE 189 | 17:13 | Forest Path - Return
**Type:** Transition

The return journey began, the afternoon light angling toward evening.

Tenchi's energy finally flagging—the day's accumulation catching up.

---

## SCENE 190 | 17:17 | Forest Path - Return
**Type:** Relationship

"Thank you for showing me," Nobuyuki said during the walk. "It clarifies several things."

"What things?"

"Why Father-in-law trusts you. The work ethic is evident."

---

## SCENE 191 | 17:21 | Forest Path - Stream
**Type:** Main Plot

The stream crossing accomplished, Tenchi needing assistance this time—legs tired, attention wandering.

Sheldon lifted the child across, the action natural now.

---

## SCENE 192 | 17:25 | Forest Path - Upper
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Nobuyuki observed the lift, the easy handling of his son.

Another data point in the ongoing assessment.

---

## SCENE 193 | 17:29 | Shrine Grounds - Entry
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Through the torii, the shrine grounds receiving them back.

Evening light casting long shadows across the raked gravel.

---

## SCENE 194 | 17:33 | Main House - Genkan
**Type:** Subplot

Katsuhito emerged to greet them.

"The tour was productive?"

"Illuminating," Nobuyuki replied. "The property has potential."

---

## SCENE 195 | 17:37 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

Tenchi settled immediately, the energy reserves depleted.

"Can we eat soon?"

"Birthday dinner shortly. Rest until then."

---

## SCENE 196 | 17:41 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

The child curled on the cushions, tanuki clutched close, consciousness fading toward nap.

Birthday twenty-third drawing toward its conclusion.

---

## SCENE 197 | 17:45 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Dinner preparation began—Katsuhito had started while they toured.

"I'll assist. What needs finishing?"

"The vegetables require cutting. The rice is cooking."

---

## SCENE 198 | 17:49 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Relationship

Nobuyuki joined, the three men working in coordinated silence.

Father-in-law, guest, and stranger—the configuration unusual but functional.

---

## SCENE 199 | 17:53 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The rhythm of shared work creating its own communication.

No words needed. The coordination spoke.

---

## SCENE 200 | 17:57 | Main House - Kitchen
**Type:** Main Plot

Birthday dinner taking shape—tempura, rice, soup.

The celebration's final meal approaching completion.
