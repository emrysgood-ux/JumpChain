---

## SCENE 001 | 04:53 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Main Plot

Day nineteen arrived with distinct purpose: collect the wheel from Yamada, begin the tanuki carving.

Two days until Tenchi's birthday. The deadline focused everything.

---

## SCENE 002 | 04:57 | Tsukino House - Bedroom
**Type:** Character Development

He'd slept at the Tsukino house, arriving late from the shrine to reduce morning travel time.

The houses had become interchangeable bases. Home was wherever he worked.

---

## SCENE 003 | 05:01 | Tsukino House - Main Room
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The tanuki carving waited. The wood selected, the tools purchased, the design visualized.

Today it would begin taking physical form.

---

## SCENE 004 | 05:05 | Tsukino House - Kitchen
**Type:** Transition

Morning routine: cold water, stretching, the minimal breakfast that fueled early labor.

The shrine expected him by six. Time moved regardless of readiness.

---

## SCENE 005 | 05:09 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

The workshop called before the shrine. The tanuki wouldn't carve itself; every available moment mattered.

He retrieved the wood block and carving tools, examining them in the growing light.

---

## SCENE 006 | 05:13 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The wood: hinoki cypress, softer than the puzzle box material, appropriate for detail work.

The tools: basic carving set from the village store, adequate for simple forms.

---

## SCENE 007 | 05:17 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

He'd never carved before. The certainty of this fact sat alongside uncertainty about what would happen when tools met wood.

The pattern suggested capability would emerge. He trusted the pattern.

---

## SCENE 008 | 05:21 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

First cut. The blade entered wood, revealing the lighter material beneath the weathered surface.

The motion felt... not wrong. Not masterful, but not wrong.

---

## SCENE 009 | 05:25 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Subplot

The tanuki's basic form needed to emerge from the block. Round belly, distinct head, small pointed ears.

He began removing bulk material, working toward the shape hidden inside.

---

## SCENE 010 | 05:29 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

Carving was sculpture—revealing form rather than adding material. The inverse of construction.

The discipline felt familiar despite being new. The principles translated.

---

## SCENE 011 | 05:33 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

Shavings accumulated as the form emerged. The belly's curve appeared first, the most prominent feature.

His hands found a rhythm. The wood responded to consistent attention.

---

## SCENE 012 | 05:37 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Worldbuilding

The tanuki's proportions: belly prominent, head tilted with characteristic mischief, short limbs suggesting capability rather than elegance.

Folklore character captured in wood.

---

## SCENE 013 | 05:41 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Main Plot

Thirty minutes of work had established the basic shape. Details would require finer tools, more time.

Enough progress for the morning. The shrine awaited.

---

## SCENE 014 | 05:45 | Tsukino House - Outbuilding
**Type:** Character Development

He set the partially carved figure aside, hiding it with the puzzle box components.

The secret accumulated. Both items would appear together on birthday morning.

---

## SCENE 015 | 05:49 | Tsukino House - Main Room

Quick cleanup, clothes changed to presentable condition. Sawdust brushed away, evidence concealed.

The Tsukino house kept its secrets.

The forest accepted his passage with familiar indifference.

Nineteen days of crossing. The skill was installed.

Three hundred twenty steps, counting begun automatically.

The number had become mantra. The climbing, meditation.

The countdown had reached single digits (adjusted for five-year-old mathematics). The excitement was nearly unbearable.

"Will Papa really come?"

"He'll come. He said he would."

Two days to finish. The timeline held.

Two days until the birthday. Two days until the gift revealed.

The village path led to Yamada's workshop. The wheel waited; the conversation about roofing waited.

Multiple purposes, single trip.

The workshop showed signs of Friday activity. Yamada visible inside, working on some project.

"Yamada-san. Good morning."

The carpenter emerged, wiping hands on his apron.

"Tsukino-san. The wheel is ready. Come see."

---

## SCENE 046 | 08:05 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Worldbuilding

"The spoke was worse than it appeared. Required complete replacement rather than repair."

---

"The Tsukino house. Significant tile displacement. Water damage throughout."

---

## **Roof Consultation - Shrine Work - Midday**

---

## SCENE 051 | 08:25 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Main Plot

"How bad is the damage?" Yamada asked, pulling out a worn notebook.

"Water damage in one room, floor to ceiling. The tiles have shifted in several locations above it."

---

## SCENE 052 | 08:29 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Yamada made notes, his experience converting description to assessment.

"Nishida will want to see it himself. Tile work requires inspection before quoting."

**Type:** Character Development

"Can you arrange an introduction?"

"I'll send word. Expect him within the week. He's reliable."

The network functioning. A stranger two weeks ago; connected now through accumulated trust.

---

## SCENE 054 | 08:37 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Subplot

"The wheel—can I transport it now, or should I collect it later?"

"Now is fine. The cart is yours; the wheel should join it."

---

## SCENE 055 | 08:41 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Main Plot

The wheel was lighter than expected, or he was stronger than he'd been. Both possibilities seemed true.

"What do I owe for the repair?"

---

## SCENE 056 | 08:45 | Village - Yamada Workshop
**Type:** Worldbuilding

Yamada named a figure—reasonable, fair, lower than he'd expected from research.

"Community price," the carpenter explained. "The shrine's property. We all benefit."

---

Community price. The concept had appeared before—reduced rates for those contributing to shared welfare.

Economics interwoven with social fabric.

The shrine steps would present a challenge.

---

Physical problem-solving through movement.

---

The crossing succeeded through careful selection.

Three hundred twenty steps with a wheel. The challenge exceeded normal difficulty.

He began, choosing each placement with precision.

---

The weight grew heavier with each step, fatigue accumulating faster than normal.

Adaptation had limits. This exceeded comfortable parameters.

---

## SCENE 064 | 09:25 | Shrine Steps - Upper

The final steps required genuine effort—muscles complaining, breath labored.

But the top arrived. The wheel reached its destination.

Sheldon positioned the repaired wheel, examining the attachment mechanism.

---

## SCENE 067 | 09:37 | Shrine Grounds - Cart Storage

## SCENE 071 | 09:53 | Shrine Grounds - Main Area
**Type:** Subplot

Katsuhito nodded, the name apparently familiar. "Nishida is skilled. Expensive but thorough."

"The damage requires thorough."

"Then he is the right choice."

---

## SCENE 072 | 09:57 | Shrine Grounds - Main Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The repair networks extended beyond the village. Kurashiki specialists for complex work, village craftsmen for routine maintenance.

Layers of capability, accessible through introduction.

---

## SCENE 073 | 10:01 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Main Plot

The morning's physical work had depleted reserves. Water, rest, the recovery that followed exertion.

"The garden needs attention this afternoon," Katsuhito noted. "After your rest."

---

## SCENE 074 | 10:05 | Main House - Common Area
**Type:** Character Development

He'd volunteered for numerical tasks; the tasks remained available.

---

## SCENE 087 | 10:57 | Shrine Office - Work Area

The records showed the shrine's financial state—stable, not prosperous. The summer festival would determine the year's outcome.

August loomed with significance.

---

"The patterns are restored. The next wind will test them."

"As it tests everything."

---

## SCENE 096 | 11:33 | Main House - Dining Area
**Type:** Internal/Reflection
