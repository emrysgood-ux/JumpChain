# DAYS 20-24 - APRIL 22-26, 1989 (SAT-WED)
## MASAKI NOBUYUKI POV
## **The Father's Assessment**

---

**POV Note:** Nobuyuki Masaki is Tenchi's father, Katsuhito's son-in-law, and an architect based in Kurashiki. Born mid-1800s with diluted Juraian heritage, he appears mid-40s. He knows something of his heritage but not the full truth about Katsuhito. His wife Kiyone died approximately three years ago. He has left Tenchi primarily in Katsuhito's care due to work demands and grief. He visits when he can.

# DAY 20 - APRIL 22, 1989 (SATURDAY)
## **Arrival and First Impressions**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## JOURNEY (Scenes 001-050)

The drive from Kurashiki to the mountains took two hours when traffic cooperated. Today it cooperated—Saturday morning, early enough to miss the weekend traffic patterns.

Nobuyuki used the drive to rehearse what Katsuhito had told him.

A stranger had appeared three weeks ago. American. Physicist. No documentation. No explanation. Skills that manifested without training.

The summary sounded like science fiction. But Katsuhito didn't exaggerate, didn't dramatize. If his father-in-law said the man was strange, the man was strange.

The question was what kind of strange.

---

## ARRIVAL (Scenes 051-100)

The mountain road wound through familiar territory—the landscape of his courtship, his marriage, his loss. Every curve held memories.

The parking area came into view. Tenchi's voice followed immediately.

"PAPA!"

The boy launched from the steps, covering the distance in a run that still showed four-year-old coordination. Five tomorrow. Growing so fast.

"There's my boy!"

The hug was necessary—the physical confirmation that his son still existed, still knew him, still wanted him.

---

The shrine looked the same. Katsuhito looked the same—would always look the same, aging at a pace that defied normal metrics.

And there was the stranger.

Standing on the engawa. Keeping appropriate distance. Watching without intruding.

The man was tall, Western features but something else in his bearing. Brown eyes with silver flecks—visible even from this distance, catching morning light.

Nobuyuki's instincts activated. Something was off. Not dangerous-off, but off.

---

## THE HANDSHAKE (Scenes 101-150)

The introduction was brief. Handshake firm but not competitive. Eye contact steady but not challenging.

"Masaki Nobuyuki. Tenchi's father."

"Tsukino Sheldon. Guest of your father-in-law."

The surname registered. Tsukino—the family that had died out. The property that had sat abandoned for decades. The coincidence that couldn't be coincidence.

"My father says you've been helpful."

"The household welcomed me. I try to contribute."

---

The assessment began with the handshake and continued through breakfast.

The food was exceptional. Restaurant quality. The kind of precision that took years to develop.

"Father says you're a physicist."

"Was. Theoretical. Four doctorates. It seems like another life."

"Because it was?"

The question probed deliberately. The response came measured.

"I died in an accident. Particle accelerator malfunction. Then I woke here. I don't understand the mechanism."

---

The story was impossible. The telling was sincere.

Nobuyuki had inherited his wife's ability to sense deception—a diluted form of the Juraian sensitivity to emotional resonance. The man wasn't lying. He might be wrong, might be deluded, but he believed what he said.

---

## AFTERNOON - OBSERVATION (Scenes 151-220)

The afternoon provided observation opportunities. The stranger moved through household tasks with familiar ease—after only three weeks, he navigated the kitchen like he'd designed it himself.

Tenchi orbited him. The attachment was obvious, concerning, potentially problematic.

"You've bonded with my son."

"He's been welcoming. I've tried to be worthy of that welcome."

"Worthy."

"The word seems appropriate. Children's trust is valuable. It shouldn't be taken lightly."

---

The response was measured, thoughtful, appropriate. The response of someone who understood boundaries, who respected the complexity of the situation.

The response that didn't explain why a stranger could cook like a master chef, work wood like a craftsman, and adapt to physical labor without the expected learning curve.

---

## EVENING - KATSUHITO'S COUNSEL (Scenes 221-299)

The evening brought private conversation with Katsuhito while Tenchi played and the stranger prepared dinner.

"What is he?"

"I don't know."

"That's not reassuring."

"It's honest. Three weeks of observation haven't provided answers."

---

The conversation continued in low tones.

"He's not Juraian—the markers are wrong. He's not demonic—no malicious resonance. He's not artificial—the emotional authenticity is too complete."

"So what does that leave?"

"Something outside my experience. Something new."

---

Katsuhito's experience spanned seven centuries. If something was outside that experience, it was genuinely unprecedented.

"Should I investigate him?"

"You could try. I doubt you'll find anything useful. He has no documentation, no verifiable history in this world."

"In this world."

"His previous world, if his story is accurate, had different records. Records that ended when he did."

---

The dinner was excellent. Again. The evening comfortable despite the undercurrent of assessment.

Tenchi's happiness was obvious. Katsuhito's caution was tempered by practical acceptance. The household functioned better than Nobuyuki had seen since Kiyone's death.

Whatever the stranger was, he was helping.

---

**Day 20 Summary:**
- First meeting conducted
- Assessment begun
- Food quality noted
- Tenchi attachment observed
- Initial conclusion: strange but not hostile

---

# DAY 21 - APRIL 23, 1989 (SUNDAY)
## **Birthday Celebration and Deeper Assessment**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING - CELEBRATION (Scenes 001-100)

The birthday celebration proceeded with appropriate festivity. Breakfast was extraordinary—the stranger's attention to traditional forms suggesting deep cultural knowledge.

Sea bream for luck. Red rice for celebration. Every detail correct.

Where did an American physicist learn Japanese birthday traditions?

---

The gifts revealed more data.

The building set Nobuyuki had brought: standard commercial product, practical, age-appropriate.

Katsuhito's hero book: family heirloom, weighty with significance.

The stranger's puzzle box: handcrafted, traditional construction, the kind of joinery that required years to master.

"You made this."

"I did."

"When did you learn puzzle box construction?"

"Three weeks ago. When I started making it."

---

The answer should have been absurd. The evidence contradicted the absurdity.

Tenchi solved the puzzle within minutes. The tanuki inside delighted him beyond all proportion.

"He remembers that Tenchi likes tanuki stories."

"He pays attention." Katsuhito's observation was neutral but pointed.

---

## MIDDAY - ASSESSMENT CONSOLIDATION (Scenes 101-200)

The celebration paused for adult conversation while Tenchi played with his gifts.

"I should investigate you," Nobuyuki said directly. "Find out who you really are."

"You should. It's what a father would do."

"But?"

"I don't know what you'll find. I doubt you'll find anything."

---

The exchange was remarkable for its honesty. The stranger invited investigation while acknowledging its likely futility.

"Why aren't you defensive?"

"Because I have nothing to hide. I don't understand what happened to me. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know where my capabilities come from. Investigation might help us all understand."

---

The sincerity read as genuine. The situation remained impossible.

"My son loves you. Already. After three weeks."

"I know. It's faster than I expected. Children form attachments quickly when their needs are met."

"And you're meeting his needs."

"I'm trying to. Food, attention, patience, presence. The basics of care."

---

## EVENING - DECISION (Scenes 201-299)

The birthday dinner was the stranger's finest work yet. Every element precisely calibrated to celebration, to family, to the moment's requirements.

Nobuyuki watched his son blow out candles. Watched the wish being made. Watched the joy that celebration brought.

The household was functioning. Tenchi was thriving. Katsuhito was less alone.

The stranger was responsible for all of it.

---

The evening's end brought final assessment.

"I should investigate you. But I won't. Not yet."

"May I ask why?"

"Because my son is happy. Because my father-in-law accepts you. Because this household has been empty too long, and you've filled some of that emptiness."

---

The stranger received this with appropriate gravity.

"I understand. And I appreciate the forbearance."

"It's not forbearance. It's conditional acceptance. You've earned a chance. Don't waste it."

"I won't."

---

**Day 21 Summary:**
- Birthday celebrated successfully
- Puzzle box assessed (impossible skill)
- Investigation declined conditionally
- Assessment: strange, helpful, accepted provisionally

---

# DAY 22 - APRIL 24, 1989 (MONDAY)
## **Departure Day**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes condensed)

## MORNING (Scenes 001-150)

Tenchi's actual birthday. Five years old.

The morning meal was again exceptional. The stranger's consistency was perhaps the most remarkable thing—no off days, no failures, just sustained excellence.

"Happy fifth birthday."

"Really five now."

"Really five."

---

The goodbye with Tenchi was difficult. Always was. The drive back to Kurashiki, the weeks until the next visit, the distance that work and grief had created.

"I'll come back. In two weeks."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

---

The final exchange with the stranger was brief but weighted.

"Take care of them."

"I will."

"Whatever you are—wherever you came from—use it well. Use it for them."

"That's my intention."

---

## DRIVE HOME (Scenes 151-200)

The return journey provided processing time.

Three days with the stranger. Substantial observation. Clear conclusions still elusive.

What was known:
- Skills manifested without training
- Physical capability exceeded norms
- Previous life memories appeared genuine
- Behavioral pattern consistently helpful
- Attachment to household forming rapidly

What was unknown:
- Origin (if not this world, then where?)
- Mechanism (how did skills emerge?)
- Purpose (why here, why now?)
- Duration (would he stay?)

---

## EVENING - KURASHIKI (Scenes 201-299)

Home. The apartment that had been theirs, then hers, then his alone.

The silence pressed differently tonight. The mountain had sounds—birds, wind, the stranger's kitchen activity. The apartment had only quiet.

Nobuyuki poured himself tea and contemplated the situation.

His son had found a new anchor. His father-in-law had found an assistant. His wife's household had found someone to fill the space she'd left.

The ache of replacement mixed with the relief of continuation.

Whatever Sheldon Tsukino was, he was helping the people Nobuyuki loved. For now, that would be enough.

---

**Day 22 Summary:**
- Actual birthday observed
- Departure completed
- Processing during drive
- Resolution: conditional acceptance maintained

---

# DAYS 23-24 - APRIL 25-26, 1989 (TUE-WED)
## **Return to Normal**

---

### COMBINED SCENE SUMMARY (598 scenes condensed)

## KURASHIKI DAYS

Work resumed. The architecture firm demanded attention. Projects in various stages required management.

But the mountain stayed present in thought.

---

The investigation would happen eventually. Nobuyuki's nature demanded it. But the timing was wrong—disrupting a functioning household to satisfy curiosity served no one.

Instead, he began quieter research. Academic databases. Physics journals. University of Alaska Fairbanks records.

The name appeared: Sheldon Tsukino, PhD (x4), theoretical physics, computational methods. Publications through 1988. Then nothing.

The man existed. Had existed. In records accessible from Kurashiki.

---

The particle accelerator angle proved harder to verify. Lab incident reports weren't public. But the timeline was correct—the facility existed, the accident types were real, the possibility remained plausible.

The stranger's story could be true. Someone had existed with that name, that background, those credentials.

Whether that person had died and somehow arrived in rural Okayama was a question no database could answer.

---

Phone call to the mountain. Wednesday evening.

"How is everything?"

"Settled. The roof assessment is tomorrow."

"The Tsukino house?"

"Yes. Nishida recommended by Yamada."

"I know Nishida's work. He's thorough."

---

The conversation continued—practical matters, household updates, Tenchi's first days of being five.

"He's adjusting well?"

"Thriving, actually. The stability seems to be helping."

"And the stranger?"

"Continues as before. Consistent. Helpful. Strange."

---

**Days 23-24 Summary:**
- Normal life resumed in Kurashiki
- Background research begun
- Records exist for Sheldon Tsukino
- Phone contact maintained
- Assessment: story potentially verifiable
