# Epic Fiction Writing Mandates

## Production Guidelines (Configurable)

> **Note**: Production targets are configurable via `WritingGenerationEngine.setMinimumDailyScenesPerCharacter()`.
> The 299 figure refers to total scenes per chapter (like Chapter 1), NOT a daily per-character requirement.
> Adjust targets based on your actual production capacity and quality goals.

### Session Production Targets

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Intensive |
|--------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Scenes per Character per Session** | 3-5 | 5-10 | 10-20 |
| **Active Characters per Session** | 1-2 | 2-3 | 3-5 |
| **Total Session Scenes** | 5-10 | 15-30 | 30-100 |

### Word Count Goals

| Category | Target | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Words per Scene** | 800-2,500 | Maximize within quality bounds |
| **Session Word Output** | 4,000-25,000 | Based on scene count × avg words |
| **Weekly Word Output** | 28,000-175,000 | Sustained production |

## Flexible Production Guidelines

### Capacity-Based Scheduling

```
PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Maintain consistent quality FIRST
2. Hit scene targets for the session SECOND
3. Maximize word count within scenes THIRD
4. Polish prose FOURTH
```

### Recovery from Shortfalls

1. **Scene Shortfall**: Roll incomplete scenes to next session
2. **Word Count Shortfall**: Focus on depth in next session
3. **Quality Issues**: Pause production for revision pass

## Scale Reference

### For a 12,008 Chapter Epic (300M+ words)

| Component | Estimate | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Total Chapters | 12,008 | |
| Avg Scenes/Chapter | ~200 | Varies by chapter type |
| Total Scenes | ~2,400,000 | |
| Total Words | 300,000,000+ | |
| Production Timeline | Flexible | Based on actual capacity |

### Scene-to-Chapter Mapping

```
1 Chapter = ~200 scenes average
1 Arc = ~50 chapters = ~10,000 scenes
1 Book = ~200 chapters = ~40,000 scenes
1 Series = ~12,008 chapters = ~2,401,600 scenes
```

## Usage Notes

> **Production targets should be set realistically based on:**
> - Available time per session
> - Writer capacity and style
> - Quality requirements
> - Chapter complexity
>
> Use `engine.setMinimumDailyScenesPerCharacter(n)` to configure tracking.
> Default is 0 (disabled). Recommended: 3-10 for active tracking.
