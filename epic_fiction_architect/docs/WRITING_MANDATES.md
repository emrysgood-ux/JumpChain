# Epic Fiction Writing Mandates

## Daily Production Requirements (AI-Assisted Scaffold Generation)

> **Default**: 299 scenes per character per day for AI-assisted scaffold generation.
> Configurable via `WritingGenerationEngine.setMinimumDailyScenesPerCharacter()`.
> Lower for manual writing workflows. Raise for higher throughput sessions.

### Scene Production Minimums

| Metric | Minimum Requirement | Target | Stretch Goal |
|--------|---------------------|--------|--------------|
| **Scenes per Character per Day** | 299 | 350 | 500+ |
| **Active Characters per Day** | 5 | 10 | 20+ |
| **Total Daily Scenes** | 1,495 | 3,500 | 10,000+ |

### Word Count Goals (Scaffold Mode)

| Category | Target | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Words per Scene Scaffold** | 50-150 | Outlines, seeds, structural placeholders |
| **Daily Scaffold Output** | 75,000-225,000 | Based on 299 scenes × 5 chars × 50-150 words |
| **Expansion Target** | 800-2,500 | Final polished prose per scene |

## Mandatory Scene Distribution

### Per-Character Daily Breakdown (299 minimum)

```
Character Daily Scene Allocation:
├── Main Plot Scenes:        100 (33.4%)
├── Subplot Scenes:           80 (26.8%)
├── Character Development:    50 (16.7%)
├── Relationship Scenes:      40 (13.4%)
├── Worldbuilding Scenes:     20 (6.7%)
└── Transition/Bridge:         9 (3.0%)
                             ───
                       TOTAL: 299 scenes minimum
```

### Scene Type Requirements

## Quality Gates (Must Pass All)

### Scene Validation Checklist

- [ ] Scene advances at least one plot thread
- [ ] Character voice is consistent
- [ ] Emotional beat is present
- [ ] Word count meets or exceeds category target
- [ ] Scene connects to at least 2 other scenes
- [ ] No redundant exposition

### Daily Completion Criteria

```
MANDATORY DAILY CHECKLIST:
□ 299+ scene scaffolds completed per active character
□ All scene types represented per allocation
□ All POV characters have scene coverage
□ Emotional arc progression tracked
□ Relationship changes documented
□ Foreshadowing elements planted (min 10/day)
□ Payoffs delivered for previous setups (min 5/day)
```

### Daily Log Template

```markdown
## Day [X] Production Log

### Scene Counts
| Character | Scenes | Words | Avg Words/Scene |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| [Name 1]  | 299+   | XXX   | XXX             |
| [Name 2]  | 299+   | XXX   | XXX             |
| ...       | ...    | ...   | ...             |

### Totals
- Total Scenes: [must be ≥299 × active characters]
- Total Words: [scaffold output]
- Scenes Below Target: [must be 0]

### Notes
[Any deviations must be documented and compensated next day]
```

### Weekly Summary Requirements

| Metric | Weekly Minimum | Formula |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Total Scenes | 2,093+ per character | 299 × 7 days |
| Scaffold Words | 522,500+ | 75,000 × 7 |
| Plot Threads Advanced | 50+ | |
| Character Arcs Progressed | All active | |
| Relationships Evolved | 20+ | |

## Enforcement Rules

### Deficit Recovery

1. **Scene Shortfall**: Any day below 299 scenes per character requires 150% production the following day
2. **Scaffold Shortfall**: Missing scaffold targets must be compensated within 48 hours
3. **Consecutive Failures**: 3 consecutive days below minimum triggers full production audit

### Maximum Output Priority

```
PRIORITY ORDER (AI-assisted scaffold generation):
1. Hit 299 scene minimum per character FIRST
2. Ensure structural coverage across scene types SECOND
3. Maximize connective tissue between scenes THIRD
4. Mark expansion priorities FOURTH
```

## Scale Reference

### For a 12,008 Chapter Epic (300M+ words)

| Timeline | Scenes Needed | At 299/char/day | Days Required |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 80 Characters | 2,401,600 total | 23,920/day | ~100 days |
| Per Chapter | ~200 scenes avg | | |
| Total Words | 300,000,000+ | | |

### Scene-to-Chapter Mapping

```
1 Chapter = ~200 scenes average
1 Arc = ~50 chapters = ~10,000 scenes
1 Book = ~200 chapters = ~40,000 scenes
1 Series = ~12,008 chapters = ~2,401,600 scenes
```

## Configuration Notes

> **Default**: 299 scenes/character/day (AI-assisted scaffold generation)
>
> Use `engine.setMinimumDailyScenesPerCharacter(n)` to adjust:
> - **Lower** for manual writing workflows
> - **Higher** for intensive batch sessions
>
> Scaffold output (50-150 words/scene) is expanded later to full prose (800-2,500 words/scene).
