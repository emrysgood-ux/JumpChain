### Weekly Summary Requirements

## Enforcement Rules

### Deficit Recovery

1. **Scene Shortfall**: Any day below 299 scenes per character requires 150% production the following day
2. **Word Count Shortfall**: Missing word targets must be compensated within 48 hours
3. **Consecutive Failures**: 3 consecutive days below minimum triggers full production audit

### Maximum Output Priority

```
PRIORITY ORDER (when time-constrained):
1. Hit 299 scene minimum per character FIRST
2. Maximize word count within each scene SECOND
3. Optimize scene quality THIRD
4. Polish prose FOURTH
```

## Calculation Reference

### For a 12,008 Chapter Epic (300M+ words)

| Timeline | Scenes Needed | At 299/char/day | Days Required |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 80 Characters | 2,401,600 total | 23,920/day | ~100 days |
| Per Chapter | ~200 scenes avg | | |
| Total Words | 300,000,000+ | 3,000,000/day | ~100 days |

### Scene-to-Chapter Mapping

```
1 Chapter = ~200 scenes average
1 Arc = ~50 chapters = ~10,000 scenes
1 Book = ~200 chapters = ~40,000 scenes
1 Series = ~12,008 chapters = ~2,401,600 scenes
```
