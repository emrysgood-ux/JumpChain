# THE ORIGINAL TIMELINE — What Would Have Been

## The World Without Sheldon: Baseline for Divergence Tracking

This document establishes the complete "OG" (Original) timeline—what would have happened if Cosmos's son never arrived on April 3, 1989. This serves as the baseline against which all Sheldon-caused divergences are measured.

---

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

**Stress Test:** Apply Epic Fiction Architect systems to counterfactual timeline construction
**Narrative Function:** Establish baseline to show Sheldon's impact through contrast
**System Demonstrated:** Temporal tracking, character arc mapping, causality chains

## PART 1: THE FIXED PAST (Pre-April 1989)

### Events That Occur Regardless of Sheldon

| Date | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| ~1739 | Kiyone Masaki born (Yosho + Airi) | FIXED |
| ~1869 | Nobuyuki born (Yosho's descendant line) | FIXED |
| ~1900s | Kiyone marries Nobuyuki after decades of tormenting him | FIXED |
| ~1910 | Tennyo Masaki born | FIXED |
| April 24, 1984 | Tenchi Masaki born | FIXED |
| ~1984 | Rea discovered, adopted by Kiyone | FIXED |
| **~1986-1987** | **Kiyone Masaki dies (age 248, natural aging)** | **FIXED** |
| ~1287 | Ryoko sealed in cave by Yosho | FIXED (700 years prior) |

### The State of the World on April 3, 1989

**At Masaki Shrine:**
- Katsuhito/Yosho (age ~950): Tending shrine, raising grandson alone
- Tenchi (age 4, nearly 5): Motherless, curious, attached to grandfather
- Nobuyuki: Working in Kurashiki, weekend visits only
- Ryoko: Sealed in cave, watching via astral projection

**What's Missing Without Sheldon:**
- No additional adult caretaker
- No one to share domestic burden with Katsuhito
- No stabilizing presence for Tenchi
- No future romantic partner for Yosho
- No Lambda-infused meals healing emotional wounds

---

## PART 2: THE OG TIMELINE (1989-2001)

### Year 1 (1989-1990) — WITHOUT SHELDON

#### April 1989
| OG Event | Emotional State |
|----------|-----------------|
| Tenchi turns 5 (April 24) | Quiet celebration; Katsuhito and Nobuyuki only |
| Normal shrine life continues | Katsuhito manages alone; Tenchi somewhat lonely |
| No newcomer arrives | Ryoko observes same two people she's watched for years |

#### May-August 1989
| OG Event | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Golden Week | Nobuyuki visits; brief family time |
| Summer | Tenchi plays alone or with village children |
| **August: First anniversary of Kiyone's death** | Katsuhito grieves privately; Nobuyuki visits grave alone; Tenchi doesn't fully understand |

#### September 1989 - March 1990
| OG Event | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| School year continues | Tenchi in kindergarten, then transitions to elementary |
| New Year | Traditional observances; Nobuyuki visits |
| Routine | Katsuhito maintains shrine; Tenchi grows; nothing changes |

**OG Year 1 Summary:**
- Tenchi is loved but lacks consistent nurturing presence
- Katsuhito is competent but emotionally reserved
- Nobuyuki is present on weekends but absent most of the time
- The household functions but doesn't thrive
- Ryoko watches the same patterns she's seen for years

---

### Years 2-4 (1990-1993) — The Quiet Stagnation

| Year | Tenchi Age | OG Events |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 2 | 5→6 | Kindergarten; lonely at times; grandfather is busy |
| 3 | 6→7 | Elementary school begins; makes school friends |
| 4 | 7→8 | Normal childhood; no revelation to Yosho (no Sheldon to reveal to) |

**Key Difference: Year 4**
In the Sheldon timeline, Year 4 is when Sheldon reveals his truth to Yosho, and sword training begins. In the OG timeline:
- No revelation occurs (no Sheldon)
- Yosho continues to hide his true nature
- Tenchi's training doesn't begin early
- The household remains two people + weekend father

**Yosho's Isolation Continues:**
- Has now been alone on Earth for ~700 years
- Daughter Kiyone dead (2-3 years now)
- No peer to confide in
- No romantic prospect
- Continues the patience that has become hollow

---

### Years 5-12 (1993-2000) — The Waiting Years

| Year | Tenchi Age | OG Events | Yosho's State |
|------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 5 | 8→9 | Normal childhood | Continuing routine |
| 6 | 9→10 | Great Hanshin Earthquake (Jan 1995) | Distant news; village unaffected |
| 7 | 10→11 | Aum Shinrikyo attacks | Distant news |
| 8 | 11→12 | Elementary ends | Tenchi growing up |
| 9 | 12→13 | Middle school begins | Adolescence beginning |
| 10 | 13→14 | Yosho senses seal weakening | Preparing for what comes |
| 11 | 14→15 | Middle school ends | Tenchi becoming young man |
| 12 | 15→16 | High school begins | Final preparations |

**Critical OG Difference: No Early Training**
Without Sheldon:
- Tenchi receives NO sword training before Year 13
- His first contact with supernatural is Ryoko's attack
- He faces Kagato with less preparation
- His emotional foundation is less stable

**Yosho's Millennium of Solitude:**
By Year 12, Yosho has been:
- On Earth ~712 years
- Widowed from Kasumi ~574 years
- Separated from Airi ~centuries
- Daughter Kiyone dead ~14 years
- Completely alone except for a teenage grandson

## PART 3: CANON EVENTS (Year 13 / 2001)

### The Ryoko Release — OG VERSION

**Summer 2001 — Tenchi age 17**

| Event | OG Version | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Tenchi enters forbidden cave | Curiosity; grandfather's warnings ignored | Same as canon |
| Breaks seal on Ryoko | Touches sword/stone | Same as canon |
| Ryoko awakens | **700 years of isolation, rage, and loneliness** | Same emotional state as canon |
| Ryoko attacks Tenchi | "Letting off steam" — not trying to kill | Same as canon |
| School attack | Ryoko pursues Tenchi | Same as canon |

**What Ryoko Has Observed (OG Version):**

In the OG timeline, Ryoko spent 12 years (1989-2001) watching:
- A lonely boy raised by a distant grandfather
- A father who visits weekends only
- A household of TWO people, not three
- No warmth, no family meals, no laughter
- The same patterns she watched for centuries before

**Ryoko's Emotional State (OG):**
- Still lonely, still cold, still angry
- Has seen Tenchi grow up but hasn't seen healthy family dynamics
- Her "rehabilitation" through observation is INCOMPLETE
- She has no model for what family could look like
- Her attachment to Tenchi is possessive, not healthy

---

### The Alien Arrivals — OG VERSION

| Arrival | OG Timing | OG Household State |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Ryoko moves in | Days after release | Joins household of 2 (Yosho + Tenchi) |
| Ayeka + Sasami arrive | Shortly after | Seeking Yosho; find small household |
| Mihoshi crashes | Shortly after | GP officer; joins chaos |
| Kagato arrives | Months later | Main antagonist arc |
| Washu freed | After Kagato defeat | Joins household |

**Critical OG Difference: Household Dynamics**

When the aliens arrive in the OG timeline, they find:
- **Two people** (Yosho and Tenchi), not three
- **No established family warmth** — functional but cold
- **No precedent** for integrating strangers
- **No mediator** between personalities
- **No one cooking meals** that heal emotional wounds

---

### The Kagato Arc — OG VERSION

| Event | OG Version | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Kagato arrives | Same timing | Same threat |
| Household defense | Less coordinated | No Sheldon as stabilizing presence |
| Tenchi's growth | Same arc | Manifests 3 LHW |
| Washu freed | Same outcome | Joins household |
| Post-Kagato | Chaotic household | Everyone traumatized, no one processing |

**Tenchi's First LHW Manifestation (OG):**
- Same crisis triggers manifestation
- Same 3 wings
- But less emotional foundation
- Less understanding of what family means
- Victory is survival, not triumph

---

## PART 4: POST-CANON YEARS (2002-2025)

### OG Household Composition

By end of Year 13, the OG Masaki household contains:
1. Katsuhito/Yosho (revealed as young)
2. Tenchi (age 17)
3. Ryoko (traumatized space pirate)
4. Ayeka (Juraian princess, rival dynamic)
5. Sasami (child princess, only gentle presence)
6. Mihoshi (chaotic GP officer)
7. Washu (scientist goddess, observing)
8. Ryo-Ohki (cabbit)

**What's Missing:**
- Stable adult presence
- Someone who cooks meals with love
- Mediator between rivalries
- Model for healthy relationships
- Yosho's romantic partner

### OG Dynamics (Years 14-25)

| Dynamic | OG Version | Impact |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Ryoko-Ayeka rivalry | **Intense, unmediated** | No Sheldon to defuse tensions |
| Tenchi's stress | **Higher** | No emotional support adult |
| Yosho's isolation | **Continues** | No peer, no partner |
| Meal times | **Chaotic or absent** | No Supreme Chef |
| Household warmth | **Lower** | No Lambda-infused comfort |

### OG Marriage Outcome

**Canon suggests Tenchi eventually marries all seven women.** In the OG timeline:
- This happens through gradual attrition of conflict
- Less healthy foundation
- More possessive dynamics
- Functional but not thriving

---

## PART 5: OG MILLENNIUM (2001-2989)

### Century-by-Century OG Projection

| Century | OG State | Key Difference from Sheldon Timeline |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1st (2001-2089) | Canon events; chaotic household; eventual marriages | Less stable; more conflict |
| 2nd (2089-2189) | Family expands; less cohesion | Weaker family culture |
| 3rd (2189-2289) | Galactic integration | Less diplomatic influence |
| 4th (2289-2389) | Growth continues | No "Masaki Style" philosophy |
| 5th (2389-2489) | Challenges emerge | Less resilience |
| 6th (2489-2589) | Recovery | Slower healing |
| 7th (2589-2689) | Maturity | Yosho still alone |
| 8th (2689-2789) | **Yosho dies alone** | No partner; dies of exhaustion |
| 9th (2789-2889) | Post-Yosho | Family continues; less unified |
| 10th (2889-2989) | Millennium ends | No Sheldon departure; just time passing |

### Yosho's OG Fate

**Without Sheldon:**
- Never finds romantic partner
- Remains isolated despite crowded household
- Dies after ~1,700 years
- Dies **alone**, surrounded by family but not intimately connected
- His final words are to Tenchi, not a partner

**The Tragedy:**
> "He waited 700 years for something that never came. He watched his daughter die. He raised his grandson. He saw the galaxy change around him. And when the end came, he was exactly as alone as the day he arrived on Earth."

### Tenchi's Emotional Foundation (OG vs Sheldon)

**OG Timeline:**
- Foundation: Adequate (grandfather's care)
- Stability: Medium (weekend father, distant grandfather)
- Model for relationships: Limited (two men, minimal warmth)
- Crisis response: Reactive (no preparation)
- Adult relationships: Functional but struggle

**Sheldon Timeline:**
- Foundation: Strong (nurturing presence + grandfather)
- Stability: High (consistent adult care)
- Model for relationships: Strong (warm family dynamic)
- Crisis response: Prepared (training + emotional readiness)
- Adult relationships: Healthy models internalized

---

## PART 10: THE WEIGHT OF ABSENCE

### What the OG Timeline Lacks

**Daily Life:**
- No meals that heal emotional wounds
- No one to mediate between personalities
- No adult peer for Yosho
- No model of healthy found family

**Crisis Response:**
- Less prepared Tenchi
- Less stable household base
- No additional adult perspective
- No Lambda-powered comfort

**Long-Term:**
- Yosho dies alone after 1,700 years
- Family culture is weaker
- Galactic influence is reduced
- The millennium is functional, not thriving

### The Tragedy Sheldon Prevents

> In the OG timeline, Yosho—Crown Prince of Jurai, hero who saved Earth from Ryoko, 700-year guardian of the seal—dies after 1,700 years of existence having never found a true partner after his exile.
>
> He watches his first wife Kasumi die at 138.
> He watches his estranged wife Airi leave.
> He watches his daughter Kiyone die at 248.
> He raises his grandson alone.
> He integrates the chaos of alien arrivals.
> He guides the family through centuries.
>
> And when the end comes, he is exactly as alone as the day Funaho rooted itself in Earth's soil.
>
> This is what Cosmos's gift prevents.
