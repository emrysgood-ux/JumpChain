## Relationship Progression
### Son of Cosmos: JumpChain

---

## OVERVIEW

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Type** | Slow-burn romance |
| **Duration** | ~1,000 years |
| **Progression** | 5 phases across decades |
| **Endgame** | Formal Juraian bond, lifelong partnership |

---

## THE CENTRAL PROMISE

This is not a whirlwind romance. This is two deeply guarded people learning to trust across decades, finding in each other what neither expected: a true partner.

**Yosho:** 700 years of loneliness, wearing a mask so long he's forgotten his own face.

**Sheldon:** A lifetime of using work to avoid intimacy, terrified of needing anyone.

**Together:** They heal.

---

## PHASE 1: ASSESSMENT (Years 1-3)

### Yosho's Perspective
| Observation | Conclusion |
|-------------|------------|
| Lambda signature | Cosmic origin, unknown type |
| Cooking ability | Supernatural, not learned |
| Behavior with Tenchi | Genuine care, not manipulation |
| No demands | Unusual; most want something |
| Patience | Matches his own |

**Internal State:**
- First interesting thing in decades
- Cautious but intrigued
- Testing without appearing to test
- "What ARE you?"

### Sheldon's Perspective
| Observation | Conclusion |
|-------------|------------|
| Elderly priest | Kind, welcoming |
| Something "off" | Can't identify it |
| Knows more than he says | Respects the privacy |
| Lonely | Recognizes it because he is too |

**Internal State:**
- Grateful for acceptance
- Doesn't push for answers
- Focused on Tenchi, not romance
- Doesn't recognize attraction yet

### Key Moments (Phase 1)
- Day 1: First meeting on shrine steps
- Week 2: First shared meal (Sheldon cooks)
- Month 3: First genuine laugh together
- Year 1: Yosho stops testing, starts trusting
- Year 2: Comfortable silences begin
- Year 3: Sheldon realizes he looks forward to seeing him

---

## PHASE 2: TRUST (Years 4-7)

### The Shift
Yosho begins sharing fragments of truth—not the full story, but pieces.

| Year | Revelation |
|------|------------|
| 4 | "I am older than I appear" |
| 5 | "Tenchi's mother was my daughter" |
| 6 | "There are things beneath this shrine" |
| 7 | "My name was not always Katsuhito" |

### Sheldon's Response
- Accepts without demanding more
- "You'll tell me when you're ready"
- This EARNS trust, doesn't demand it
- Recognizes the pattern (he has secrets too)

### Key Moments (Phase 2)
- Year 4: Yosho drops the "elderly" act briefly (Sheldon notices, says nothing)
- Year 5: First conversation about loneliness
- Year 6: Sheldon shares about his grandmother's death
- Year 7: Yosho uses his true name ("Call me Yosho, when we're alone")

### Emotional State
- Friendship solidifying
- Mutual recognition of kindred spirits
- Still not romantic (consciously)
- Both aware something is building

---

## PHASE 3: FRIENDSHIP (Years 8-12)

### Deepening Connection
The relationship becomes essential to both. Daily routines intertwine. Neither can imagine the shrine without the other.

### What Changes
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Guest | Family |
| Helper | Partner (domestic) |
| Curiosity | Affection |
| Guarded | Vulnerable (sometimes) |

### Key Moments (Phase 3)
- Year 8: First time Yosho asks Sheldon's opinion on something important
- Year 9: Sheldon realizes he's in love (doesn't act on it)
- Year 10: Yosho realizes he's in love (doesn't act on it)
- Year 11: Tenchi (age 15) notices something between them
- Year 12: The Almost Confession (interrupted by circumstances)

### The Unspoken
Both know. Neither speaks. Reasons:
- Yosho: "He deserves someone who isn't hiding everything"
- Sheldon: "He's been alone 700 years; I won't presume"
- Both: Fear of ruining what they have

---

## PHASE 4: PARTNERSHIP (Years 13-20)

### Canon Changes Everything
Ryoko's release forces revelations. Sheldon finally learns:
- Yosho's true identity
- The full scope of cosmic politics
- What's been hidden under the shrine
- Why Tenchi matters

### The Confession (Year 14)
After the chaos settles, after Kagato falls, after the household transforms:

**Yosho:** "I have waited 700 years. I did not know I was waiting for you."

**Sheldon:** "I spent my whole first life avoiding this. I don't want to avoid it anymore."

### What Partnership Means
- Full honesty (finally)
- Shared responsibility for household
- United front with the "aunts"
- Planning for centuries, not years

### Key Moments (Phase 4)
- Year 13: Sheldon meets Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu (chaos)
- Year 14: The Confession
- Year 15: First formal acknowledgment to family
- Year 17: Airi visits (meets her husband's partner)
- Year 20: Decision to formalize

---

## PHASE 5: FORMAL COMMITMENT (Year 20+)

### The Juraian Bond Ceremony
Not a human wedding. A tree-bond ritual.

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Location | Beneath Funaho |
| Witnesses | Household + Juraian representatives |
| Ritual | Shared life-force linking |
| Symbol | Branch exchange |
| Effect | Souls intertwined; lifespan linked |

### What This Means
- Sheldon's Lambda nature allows the bond (unexpected)
- Their lifespans sync (both now ~1,000+ years)
- Legally recognized on Jurai
- Yosho finally, formally, chooses happiness

### After the Bond
- Centuries of partnership
- Raising generations of Masakis
- Galactic adventures (together)
- Quiet evenings (still, always)
- Growing old (eventually, together)

---

## THE ENDING

### ~Year 1000: Yosho's Death
- Age: ~1,700 years
- Cause: Natural, peaceful
- Location: Masaki Shrine, beneath Funaho
- Sheldon: Present, holding his hand

### Yosho's Last Words
*[To be written when we reach that scene]*

### Three Months After
- Sheldon grieves
- The household supports him
- He prepares to depart (JumpChain continues)
- Or: He stays (if that's the choice)

---

## PHYSICAL INTIMACY PROGRESSION

### Guiding Principle
This is a slow-burn. Physical intimacy follows emotional intimacy.

| Phase | Physical Expression |
|-------|---------------------|
| 1 (Assessment) | Formal distance |
| 2 (Trust) | Occasional touch (passing dishes, etc.) |
| 3 (Friendship) | Comfortable proximity, rare deliberate contact |
| 4 (Partnership) | First kiss (Year 14), increasing affection |
| 5 (Commitment) | Full intimacy (off-page, implied) |

### The First Kiss
- Year 14, after the Confession
- Initiated by: Yosho (he's waited long enough)
- Location: Shrine grounds, evening
- Witnessed by: No one (they think)
- Actually witnessed by: Washu's surveillance (she says nothing)

---

## CONFLICT POINTS

### Phase 1-2
- Sheldon doesn't know Yosho's secrets
- Yosho doesn't know Sheldon's cosmic nature
- Mutual guardedness

### Phase 3
- The Almost Confession (interrupted)
- Tenchi's adolescence demands attention
- Neither wants to disrupt stability

### Phase 4
- Canon chaos takes priority
- Other characters' drama intrudes
- Airi's existence (Yosho's other wife)

### Resolution: Airi
- Airi and Yosho have a complex arrangement
- She lives at Galaxy Academy, rarely visits
- She genuinely likes Sheldon
- Polyamorous acceptance, not jealousy
- "He's been lonely too long. Thank you."
