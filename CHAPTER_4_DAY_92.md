### Tenchi

The rain had returned overnight, as Grandpa predicted.

Tenchi woke to the familiar percussion on the roof, the gray light through his window, the humidity that made the air feel thick and close. The contrast with yesterday's sunlight was stark enough to seem unfair, as if the weather had offered a gift only to snatch it back before it could be fully appreciated.

But the disappointment was smaller than it would have been a month ago. The rainy season had taught him that gray days and bright days alternated according to patterns he couldn't control, that frustration at weather accomplished nothing useful. The expedition had happened. The wood had been found. Today's rain couldn't undo yesterday's success.

Breakfast was quiet, Grandpa focused on the newspaper that arrived each morning through means Tenchi had never quite understood—the village was far below, and no delivery person climbed the steps, yet the paper appeared on the residence's doorstep regardless. Magic, perhaps, or some arrangement with the postal service that predated Tenchi's arrival.

"School today," Grandpa said, folding the paper. "The rain is steady but not dangerous. You will need your umbrella and boots."

"I know." The routine was established now, was simply how Mondays worked during tsuyu. "Will Tsukino-san work on the wood today?"

"I expect so. The workshop provides shelter from rain. Indoor work continues regardless of weather."

The information settled something that had been mildly anxious since waking. The restoration would proceed even if Tenchi couldn't watch, even if school and weather conspired to keep him away. The wood would be prepared, would be shaped, would become door components whether or not a five-year-old was present to observe.

The descent to school was wet but manageable, umbrella held at the angle that weeks of practice had perfected, boots finding purchase on stone that rain made treacherous. The railings were there when he needed them, cedar dark with moisture, solid beneath his hand. The installation felt like it had happened long ago, though barely a week had passed since Sunday's work.

### Sheldon

The workshop smelled of cedar and possibility.

Sheldon stood before the salvaged trunk section, examining it in the morning light that filtered through windows streaked with rain. The wood's exterior was rough with decades of weathering—bark fragments, accumulated debris, the silver-gray patina that exposure produced. But beneath that aged surface, the heartwood waited, carrying qualities that the temple door required.

The first task was cleaning. Using brushes and careful scraping, Sheldon removed the outer layer of deterioration, revealing wood that grew progressively healthier as he worked inward. The cedar's characteristic red emerged, deepening as he penetrated past the weather-damaged exterior into material that had been protected from the elements.

The work was meditative, was the kind of repetitive activity that allowed thought to wander while hands stayed occupied. Ninety-two days. The count registered without demanding attention, a background awareness that had become as natural as breathing. Three months and a few days. A quarter of a year, roughly. The accumulation continued regardless of what his hands were doing.

The communion happened gradually, seeping into awareness as he worked. The wood remembered its centuries of standing, remembered storms that had bent but not broken it, remembered the final wind that had proved too strong. It remembered the fall, the impact, the long rest that followed. It remembered seasons passing overhead, rain and sun and snow cycling through years that no one counted.

"You'll serve well," Sheldon said to the wood, the words feeling appropriate even if no one could hear them. "The door needs what you can provide."

The wood didn't respond in any way he could articulate, but something in the communion shifted, settled, accepted. The match was right, as he'd told Tenchi yesterday. The forest providing for the temple, continuity maintained across centuries.

### Tenchi

School passed in the particular rhythm of rainy Mondays.

The classroom was warm with humidity, the windows fogged with the breath of twenty-three children, the air carrying the mineral smell of wet clothes drying. Sensei moved through lessons with the patience that the weather seemed to require—slower, more deliberate, allowing for the drowsiness that gray days encouraged.

Tenchi found himself thinking about the wood while Sensei talked about numbers. The cedar section in Tsukino-san's workshop, being cleaned and prepared while he sat in a classroom learning to add single digits. The contrast was amusing in a way he couldn't quite explain—the ancient tree becoming door components while he practiced writing the number seven.

"Tenchi-kun." Sensei's voice, not unkind but pointed. "What is four plus three?"

"Seven." The answer came automatically, without thought. "The number we just practiced writing."

"Very good. Please pay attention to the lesson, not the rain."

The correction was gentle, was simply redirection rather than rebuke. Tenchi nodded and focused his attention back on the board, pushing thoughts of cedar and communion to the edges of awareness where they could wait without demanding attention.

Lunch brought Kai, who wanted to hear about the expedition.

"You went into the forest? The deep part?"

"Yes. Looking for wood for the temple. Tsukino-san needed old cedar, from a tree that fell a long time ago."

"Did you get lost?"

"No. Tsukino-san knew where to go. Even when there wasn't a path anymore."

Kai's expression mixed admiration with something that might have been envy. "I've never been that deep in the forest. My mom says it's dangerous."

"It wasn't dangerous. Just... different. Quiet in a way that's still loud." Tenchi struggled to explain what he'd experienced. "The forest has its own sounds. Not like here."

"What kind of sounds?"

"Birds. And rustling. And dripping, from the leaves. And creaking, from the big trees." The description felt inadequate, couldn't capture the texture of the experience. "You'd have to hear it yourself."

"Maybe when I visit the shrine. Is there forest near there?"

"All around. The shrine is in the forest, kind of. On the mountain."

The conversation planted seeds for the future visit, gave it additional dimensions beyond simply seeing where Tenchi lived. The forest, the temple, the workshop where cedar became door components—all of it waited for weather that would allow exploration.

### Sheldon

By afternoon, the trunk section had revealed its inner character.

The heartwood was beautiful—rich red-brown with darker streaks where the grain compressed, dense with centuries of slow growth. The rings were tight, far closer together than modern lumber could achieve, evidence of the patient accumulation that had made this tree what it was before the fall.

Sheldon had rough-cut three blanks from the section, each sized generously for its intended purpose. The largest would become the bottom rail section, replacing wood that had grown soft with absorbed moisture. The two smaller pieces would replace the cracked vertical members, spliced into position where sound wood gave way to damage.

The shaping would come next, but not today. The blanks needed time to stabilize after cutting, needed to release the tension that the saw had introduced. Rushing the process would invite warping, would undermine the careful matching that the restoration required.

"Tomorrow," Sheldon said, covering the blanks with cloth to control their drying. "Or the day after. The wood will tell me when it's ready."

The workshop felt complete with the work in progress, felt purposeful in ways that idle waiting couldn't achieve. The rain continued outside, steady and patient, doing its own work while he did his. The season maintained its grip, but the grip was loosening—the respite yesterday had proved that, had demonstrated that the end was approaching even if the calendar couldn't specify when.

### Tenchi

The climb home was wet but triumphant.

Tenchi's umbrella had developed a small leak near the edge, dripping water onto his shoulder with annoying regularity. But the annoyance was minor, was simply part of what rainy season climbs involved. His boots kept his feet dry, his hand found the railings where he needed them, his legs carried him up three hundred twenty steps with the endurance that three months had built.

The shrine emerged from the mist as it always did, gradual and familiar, its forms sharpening as he approached. The torii gate, the main building, the residence where Grandpa waited—all of it assembled itself from gray obscurity into home.

"The wood," Tenchi said as he entered, shedding wet layers in the genkan. "Did Tsukino-san work on it?"

"He did." Grandpa's voice carried from the main room. "The preparation has begun. Three pieces have been rough-cut."

"Can I see? After I change?"

"If he permits visitors. The work may require concentration."

The conditional permission was familiar, was the pattern that governed access to activities beyond Tenchi's direct participation. He changed quickly, hanging wet clothes where they would dry, putting on the house clothes that indoor time required. The transition from outside to inside was ritual now, was simply what arriving home involved.

The descent to Tsukino-san's workshop was brief, the path between shrine and village house shortened by familiarity. Tenchi knocked on the workshop door with the politeness that observation privileges required.

"Come in." The voice was welcoming rather than reluctant.

The workshop's interior was warm with the scent of fresh-cut cedar, the smell richer and more immediate than yesterday's forest expedition had provided. Three pieces of wood lay on the workbench, their surfaces showing the red-brown color that the trunk's exterior had hidden. They were rough still, raw-cut rather than shaped, but their potential was visible even to untrained eyes.

"They're beautiful," Tenchi said.

"They are. The heartwood exceeded my hopes. This tree grew slowly, densely—the grain is tight enough to last centuries more."

"When will you shape them?"

"Tomorrow, perhaps. Or the day after. The wood needs to stabilize first. Cutting releases tension, and tension needs time to dissipate."

"Like when I get upset and need to calm down?"

The comparison surprised a small laugh from Tsukino-san. "Something like that. Wood has stress too, just different from yours. Rushing it produces poor results."

"Patience," Tenchi said, the word emerging with the weight of weeks of learning.

"Exactly. You're becoming quite familiar with the concept."

"Grandpa says patience is a skill. That you get better at it by practicing."

"Your grandfather is wise. What else has he taught you?"

The question opened a conversation that lasted until dinner, Tenchi recounting lessons from months of residence while Tsukino-san listened with attention that made speaking feel valued. The exchange was comfortable, was the kind of interaction that had become normal without Tenchi noticing the transformation.

### Katsuhito

Evening brought the household together around food and conversation.

Yosho observed the dynamic that had developed between his grandson and their guest, the easy exchange that characterized their interactions now. Three months ago, Tenchi had been wary of strangers, had required coaxing to engage with anyone outside immediate family. The boy who sat at the table now was different—more confident, more curious, more willing to reach toward connection.

"The wood preparation is complete," Sheldon reported. "Initial shaping can begin when the blanks have stabilized. Perhaps two days."

"The left door has waited decades for attention. Two more days is insignificant."

"The temple will be patient with me, then."

"The temple has no choice. But it appreciates the care you bring to the work."

The exchange carried layers that Tenchi couldn't perceive, references to the temple's nature that remained unexplained. Yosho caught Sheldon's slight nod, acknowledgment of meanings that exceeded surface conversation. The understanding between them had grown, had developed into something approaching alliance without ever being explicitly negotiated.

"Can I watch the shaping?" Tenchi asked. "When it happens?"

"If school and weather permit," Yosho said. "And if your observation continues to be unobtrusive."

"I'll be good. Tsukino-san said I'm becoming familiar with patience."

"High praise indeed. We shall see if it proves accurate."

The meal continued through topics of lesser weight—school, weather, the forecast that suggested rain persisting through the week. The conversation was ordinary, was exactly what household dinners should be, was evidence of stability that circumstances might not have guaranteed.

### Sheldon

Night settled with the rain's steady accompaniment.

Sheldon lay in the Tsukino house, listening to water on the roof, processing the day's work and tomorrow's plans. The wood waited in the workshop, stabilizing, preparing itself for the shaping that would transform blank into component. The process was underway, would proceed according to its own requirements regardless of external pressures.

Ninety-two days. The number completed its daily registration, marking time that had accumulated into something substantial. Tomorrow would be ninety-three, then ninety-four, the count climbing toward milestones that felt significant even when they weren't.

The temple door would be restored. The work would take days, perhaps weeks, but the outcome was no longer in question. The materials were secured, the skills were sufficient, the patience was available. What remained was simply execution—the application of capability to requirement until the gap between them closed.

The rain continued, would continue, would maintain its presence until the season decided otherwise. The forecast suggested another week of gray, possibly more. But the end was approaching, was visible in the breaks that occurred between storms, in the quality of light that penetrated clouds with increasing frequency. Summer waited behind the rainy season, would emerge when tsuyu finally released its grip.

Until then, the work continued. Indoor projects during wet days, outdoor progress during dry ones. The pattern was established, was sustainable, was simply how life on the mountain proceeded during this phase of the year.

Sheldon closed his eyes and let sleep approach, carrying with it the satisfaction of preparation complete and the anticipation of shaping to come. The cedar blanks waited in darkness, their tension slowly releasing, their readiness approaching at whatever pace the wood required.

Tomorrow would bring its own contributions to the count. And the day after. And all the days that followed, accumulating into weeks and months and eventually a year, marking time in this existence that grew less strange with each passing day.
