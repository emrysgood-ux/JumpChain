## SCENE 1.7: CLEANUP

**April 3, 1989 — ~20:15 JST**
**Location:** Main residence kitchen
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The dishes did not clean themselves.

Sheldon gathered the bowls and plates from the table with practiced efficiency—rice bowls stacked inside rice bowls, chopsticks bundled, the empty fish plate balanced on top of the pile. Katsuhito watched him with raised eyebrows.

"You need not do that, Tsukino-san. You are a guest."

"Guests who eat should help with the cleaning." The words came out with grandmother's inflection, and Sheldon heard her voice echo in his own. "That's what my grandmother would have said."

"She sounds formidable."

"She was." Sheldon carried the stack to the kitchen sink. "She raised me after my parents died. Taught me that idle hands were worse than useless—they were dangerous. A body that wasn't working was a mind that was wandering into places it shouldn't go."

He turned on the water, testing the temperature with the back of his wrist the way grandmother had taught him. Hot enough to cut grease, cool enough not to damage the lacquer. The balance mattered.

"In that case," Katsuhito said, "I will dry."

---

They worked in companionable silence.

Sheldon washed—rice bowls first, then soup bowls, then the larger plates. His hands moved through the motions automatically: scrub, rinse, pass. The soap was different from what he remembered using in his other life—harder, less foamy, smelling faintly of something he couldn't identify. Citrus, maybe. Or pine.

*Pine.* The word triggered something—a fragment of memory, slippery and incomplete. Pine trees outside a window. A kitchen that wasn't this kitchen. Hands that weren't quite his hands, doing this same work, in a life that felt simultaneously immediate and impossibly distant.

He let it go. The memories would come when they came. Grandmother had taught him that, too.

"You wash dishes like someone who has washed many dishes," Katsuhito observed, accepting a bowl and running his towel over its surface.

"My grandmother believed in self-sufficiency. Like you."

"Did she run a shrine as well?"

Sheldon almost smiled. "No. She cleaned houses for other people. Other people's houses were always cleaner than her own, she used to say, because she spent all her best work there. But our kitchen was spotless. The kitchen was sacred."

"She sounds like a Shinto priest at heart."

"She was a Baptist. Church every Sunday, prayer before every meal, the Bible on her nightstand with passages underlined in red ink." Sheldon passed another bowl. "But I think she would have understood this place. The... intention of it. The care."

Katsuhito dried the bowl and set it aside. "Care is universal, Tsukino-san. It speaks all languages."

---

The kitchen came clean in stages.

Dishes first, then the counters, then the stove—which Katsuhito handled himself, with the particular attention of someone who knew exactly how hot surfaces needed to be treated. The floor received a quick sweep but no mopping; tomorrow's work, Sheldon assumed.

"Leave the cutting board to dry overnight," Katsuhito instructed. "Wood needs to breathe. If you seal it wet, it warps."

Sheldon filed the information away. His mind was filling with new data—kitchen layouts, ingredient locations, the particular rhythms of this household—and each piece felt like a building block. A foundation being laid.

"Masaki-san."

"Hm?"

"Thank you." The words came out awkward, insufficient for what they were trying to carry. "For the meal. For the room. For... all of this. I don't understand why you're helping me, but I'm grateful."

Katsuhito set down his towel and turned to face him. In the kitchen light, the priest's face looked ancient—carved from the same wood as the building around him, weathered by the same centuries of sun and rain.

"The mountain accepted you," he said simply. "I told you this. When the mountain accepts someone, we do not question why. We simply welcome them."

"That's not an answer."

"No." Katsuhito's eyes glinted. "But it is the truth."

---

The kitchen fell silent except for the drip of water from the drying rack.

Sheldon looked around the space—clean now, everything in its place, ready for tomorrow's meals. The evening felt complete in a way he couldn't quite articulate. A cycle closed. An obligation met.

*Never leave a dish in the sink.*

He hadn't. Grandmother would have been satisfied.

"Come," Katsuhito said, draping the towel over a rack to dry. "The day has been long. A cup of tea before bed, I think, and then rest. Tomorrow will bring its own work."

Sheldon nodded and followed the priest out of the kitchen. Behind them, the clean dishes waited in orderly rows, ready to be filled again.
