# GAP G: YEARS 26-100 (2014-2089) — THE MISSING CENTURY
## Son of Cosmos: Complete Framework
## December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

Years 26-100 represent the largest gap in the story bible — an entire 75-year period between post-canon stabilization and the established millennium framework. This document fills that gap.

**Timeline Context:**
- Year 26 = 2014 (Sheldon's 26th year in-universe)
- Year 100 = 2089 (End of first century)
- Tenchi ages 30 → 105 (appears 25-30 throughout)
- Yosho ages ~740 → ~815 (unchanged in appearance)
- Sheldon ages 26 → 100 in-universe (appears ~30 throughout)

# PART 1: CHARACTER AGING REFERENCE

## 1.1 — Who Ages, Who Doesn't

| Character | Year 26 Age | Year 100 Age | Apparent Age | Notes |

# PART 2: DECADE-BY-DECADE BREAKDOWN

## 2.1 — YEARS 26-35 (2014-2024): COURTSHIP AND COMMITMENT

### The Village Speech (Year 25/2014)

The decade opens with the village elders finally addressing what everyone has noticed:

> *"The American hasn't aged. The priest hasn't aged. Strange women live at the shrine. Ships appear in the sky."*
>
> *Their conclusion: "We don't understand. We don't need to. The shrine protects this village. That's enough."*

This formalizes the village's "protective conspiracy" — they know, they don't ask, they protect.

### Relationship Timeline

| Year | Sheldon-Yosho Status |
|------|---------------------|
| 26-27 | First acknowledgment to family (not public) |
| 28-29 | Ayeka/Sasami formally recognize partnership |
| 30 | Jurai court notified (political implications) |
| 31-32 | Formal Juraian engagement protocols |
| 33-34 | Wedding preparations (two planets involved) |
| **35 (2024)** | **ENGAGEMENT FORMALIZED** |

### The Proposal (~Year 35)

**Yosho's Method:** The Juraian ship-bond tradition

In Juraian culture, proposing involves offering to bond your Royal Tree to another — essentially saying "my life-force source recognizes you as my partner."

Yosho, who has been bonded to Funaho for 700 years, offers Sheldon a formal recognition through the tree:

> *"Funaho has watched you for 35 years. She approves. I have loved you longer than I admitted. Make it formal. Be mine, as I have been yours."*

### Household Status (End of Year 35)

| Resident | Role | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Tenchi | 40 | Shrine head in training; cosmic entity stable |
| Yosho | ~775 | True form known to all family; Sheldon's fiancé |
| Sheldon | 35 in-universe | Co-patriarch; 5 stable LHW; engaged |
| Ryoko | ~5,735 | Integrated; chaotic aunt; happy |
| Ayeka | ~775 | Princess; political liaison; supportive |
| Sasami | ~775 | Tsunami-merged; primary cook (learning from Sheldon) |
| Mihoshi | ~110+ | GP officer; family member |
| Washu | 20,000+ | Scientist; watches everything with interest |
| Noike | ~60+ | Family member; administrative role |
| Ryo-Ohki | ~5,035 | Cabbit; beloved |

## 2.2 — YEARS 36-45 (2025-2034): THE WEDDING AND FIRST CHILDREN

### THE WEDDING (~Year 36 / Spring 2025)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Date** | Spring 2025 (cherry blossom season) |
| **Location** | Masaki Shrine |
| **Officiant** | Washu (cosmic authority recognized) |
| **Rituals Combined** | Traditional Shinto + Juraian tree-bond + cosmic blessing |
| **Attendees** | Jurai delegation, GP representatives, entire village |
| **Vows** | Exchanged in Japanese, Juraian, and English |
| **Duration** | Ceremony: 3 hours; Reception: 3 days minimum |

### Cosmos's Wedding Gift

For the only time in the story, Cosmos directly intervenes with a visible blessing:

**The Gift:** One-time Light Hawk Wing resonance transfer to Yosho

**What Happens:** During the vows, golden light suffuses both Sheldon and Yosho. For a moment — the first time in 700 years — Yosho manifests a Light Hawk Wing. Not his own power, but Sheldon's Lambda resonating through him.

**Yosho's Reaction:** Brought to tears. He hasn't felt that connection to higher power since leaving Jurai. The gift says: *You are worthy. You are family now.*

### The First Child: Achika (~Year 39 / 2028)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Achika (named for Tenchi's mother in Universe continuity) |
| **Birth Method** | Birthing Matrix (Sheldon-built; Washu-assisted) |
| **Genetic Parents** | Sheldon (Lambda-adapted) + Yosho (Juraian) |
| **Gender** | Female |
| **Appearance** | Dark hair, Yosho's features, Sheldon's warmth |
| **Inheritance** | Juraian lifespan, 1-3 LHW potential, cosmic resonance (minor) |

### The Second Child: Mamoru (~Year 41 / 2030)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | Mamoru (means "to protect") |
| **Birth Method** | Birthing Matrix |
| **Gender** | Male |
| **Appearance** | **Pink hair** (Usagi's genetics expressing through Lambda) |
| **Personality** | Quieter than Achika; observant; thoughtful |
| **Significance** | The pink hair confirms Cosmos connection visually |

### Washu's Involvement

**CORRECTED FROM EARLIER:** Sheldon built the Birthing Matrix himself as a surprise for Yosho. He is a genius physicist — this is his work.

| Birth | Washu's Role |
|-------|--------------|
| Achika | Informed AFTER gestation began; observer only; fascinated |
| Mamoru | ASKED to participate — wanted to learn from system she didn't invent |
| Future | Ongoing collaboration at her request |

**Significance:** The greatest scientific genius in the universe encountered technology a human physicist built that she hadn't thought of herself. This shapes her respect for Sheldon permanently.

### Household Expansion (Years 36-45)

The shrine physically expands to accommodate:
- Married couple quarters (Sheldon-Yosho)
- Nursery/children's wing
- Extended family visiting quarters
- Increased kitchen capacity (more mouths)

---

## 2.3 — YEARS 46-55 (2035-2044): NOBUYUKI'S TWILIGHT

### Nobuyuki's Aging

By Year 46 (2035), Nobuyuki is visibly elderly — the only member of the core household who ages normally.

| Year | Nobuyuki's Status |
|------|------------------|
| 46-48 | Retired; lives full-time at shrine |
| 49-50 | Health declining; still sharp mentally |
| 51-53 | Requires assistance; family rallies |
| 54-55 | Final years; peaceful |
| **~56 (2045)** | **DEATH** |

### The Nobuyuki Death Scene (~Year 56 / 2045)

**Setting:** His room at the shrine, surrounded by family

**Who's Present:**
- Tenchi (age 61, appears ~28) — holding his father's hand
- Katsuhito/Yosho — in elderly form one last time, for his son
- Sheldon — who has been family for 56 years
- Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami — the aunts who became his daughters
- Achika (~17) and Mamoru (~15) — who knew him as "Great-Grandfather"

**Nobuyuki's Last Words:**
To Tenchi: *"Your mother would be so proud. You became everything we hoped."*
To Katsuhito: *"I know you're not what you seem. I never needed to know. You were my father. That was enough."*
To Sheldon: *"Thank you for loving my family. Thank you for making my son's childhood happy."*

**Aftermath:**
- First major death Sheldon witnesses in this life
- Tenchi's grief is profound but processed (he had good role models)
- Yosho mourns a son (by marriage) — one of many he'll outlive
- Village funeral; everyone attends

### Children Growing (Years 46-55)

| Year | Achika | Mamoru |
|------|--------|--------|
| 46 | 18 — young adult | 16 — adolescent |
| 50 | 22 — university | 20 — university |
| 55 | 27 — establishing herself | 25 — finding his path |

**Relationship to Tenchi:** They consider him their OLDER BROTHER, not uncle or cousin. He was there when they were born. He helped raise them. Brother.

---

## 2.4 — YEARS 56-75 (2045-2064): THE GOLDEN MIDDLE

### Household Stabilization

Post-Nobuyuki, the household finds a new equilibrium:

| Role | Who |
|------|-----|
| **Patriarch (Official)** | Tenchi — shrine head, cosmic entity |
| **Patriarchs (Actual)** | Sheldon + Yosho — co-leadership |
| **Political Liaison** | Ayeka — Jurai relations |
| **Scientific Authority** | Washu — technology, research |
| **Domestic Heart** | Sasami + Sheldon — cooking, warmth |
| **Chaos Agent** | Ryoko + Mihoshi — keeping things interesting |

### Earth's Galactic Integration (Years 56-75)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 56-60 | Earth formally acknowledged by Jurai as protected world |
| 61-65 | First public awareness of extraterrestrial life (managed disclosure) |
| 66-70 | Limited space travel begins for humans |
| 71-75 | Earth joins provisional galactic community |

**Sheldon's Role:** As someone who bridges human and cosmic perspectives, he becomes an informal ambassador. His cooking becomes legendary at diplomatic functions.

### Third+ Children (Years 56-75)

Additional Sheldon-Yosho children are born during this period:

| Child | Birth Year | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Third | ~2050 | Details TBD |
| Fourth | ~2055 | Details TBD |
| Possible Fifth | ~2060 | Details TBD |

**Pattern:** Roughly one child per 5-7 years, spaced for attention and resources.

### Grandchildren Begin (~Year 65-75)

Achika and Mamoru have their own children:

- First grandchild ~Year 65 (2054)
- Multiple grandchildren by Year 75
- Four-generation household becomes normal

---

## 2.5 — YEARS 76-100 (2065-2089): CENTURY'S END

### The Long View Establishes

By Year 76, certain truths have become undeniable:

1. **Sheldon, Yosho, and Tenchi do not age** — Village knows; world is learning
2. **The shrine is a nexus of cosmic significance** — Openly acknowledged
3. **Family spans four+ generations** — Great-great-grandchildren exist
4. **Earth is part of something larger** — Galactic community accepted

### Village Transformation

| Era | Village Status |
|-----|----------------|
| Year 1 (1989) | Rural backwater; shrine is local curiosity |
| Year 50 (2039) | Protected enclave; "those who know" community |
| Year 100 (2089) | Pilgrimage site; "where the ageless ones live" |

**Original villagers:** All deceased by Year 100. Those who remember Sheldon's arrival are gone.

**New generations:** Know only the legend — the American who came and never aged, who married the priest who was never old.

### Century's End Status (Year 100 / 2089)

| Character | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Sheldon** | 100 years in-universe; appears ~30; 8-10 stable LHW |
| **Yosho** | ~815 years; unchanged; content |
| **Tenchi** | 105 years; appears ~25; full cosmic entity |
| **Achika** | 61 years; appears ~35; established matriarch |
| **Mamoru** | 59 years; appears ~33; family pillar |
| **Grandchildren** | 20-35 years old; third generation |
| **Great-grandchildren** | Beginning to appear |

### Reflections at Century's End

**Sheldon's Perspective:**
He has lived 100 years in this universe. He has:
- Raised a son (Tenchi) from age 4 to 105
- Married the love of his existence
- Had children and grandchildren
- Watched friends grow old and die
- Seen Earth join the galactic community
- Become a legend in his own village

And he has 900 years to go.

**The First Century Was Foundation.** The remaining nine centuries are the legacy.

The scale changes. The core doesn't.
