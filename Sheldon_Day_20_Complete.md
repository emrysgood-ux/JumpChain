Each pass of sandpaper revealed the figure more completely.

The meditative quality of sanding: repetitive motion, gradual improvement, transformation through persistence.

The tanuki's face emerged with the mischievous smile he'd intended. The eyes held intelligence. The posture suggested readiness.

The wood finish: thin layer applied with cloth, the surface absorbing then glowing.

By tomorrow, both would be ready.
