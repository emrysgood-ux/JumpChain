## SCENE 1.4: THE TSUKINO HOUSE

**April 3, 1989 — ~16:20 JST**
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house, Okayama Prefecture
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The path between the stone walls was barely wider than his shoulders, packed earth giving way to irregular stepping stones as it wound upward through a tunnel of overgrown bamboo. Late afternoon light filtered through the green canopy in shifting patterns, and somewhere ahead Sheldon could hear water moving—a stream, maybe, or runoff from the mountain above.

Three hundred meters, Yamamoto had said. It felt longer.

His body was running on something other than physical reserves now. The exhaustion from the field had settled into a background hum, present but no longer urgent, displaced by the sharper focus of someone approaching something significant. Each step brought him closer to a house he had never seen, in a village he had never lived in, carrying documents that claimed both as his birthright.

The bamboo thinned. The path curved left around a moss-covered boulder, and then—

The house.

It sat in a clearing that must once have been carefully maintained, a traditional wooden structure with dark walls and a tile roof that caught the golden afternoon light. Single story, as traditional farmhouses were, with an engawa wrapping around two visible sides—a covered veranda whose boards had weathered to silver-gray. The roof tiles were intact in some places, missing or cracked in others, the damage visible even from twenty meters away. Weeds grew tall around the foundation, and what had once been a garden was now a controlled riot of green, shapes barely distinguishable beneath years of neglect.

But the walls were straight. The windows were intact. The structure itself looked sound, waiting beneath its accumulation of weather and time like something patient, something that had known he was coming.

*The Kamogata house has been waiting for you.*

Uncle Kiyoshi's words, but they felt different now. Less metaphor, more literal truth. The house had been waiting. For years, maybe decades, through owners who aged and died and left it to the uncertain custody of neighbors and distant family. And now he was here, and whatever happened next would happen because he chose to make it happen.

Sheldon walked the remaining distance slowly, letting his eyes catalog details the way his mind always cataloged data. The genkan—the entryway—was recessed beneath the roof overhang, its step worn smooth by generations of feet. A wooden nameplate hung beside the door, the characters faded but still legible: 月野. Tsukino. His name, apparently. His family's name, certainly, according to every document in his wallet.

The door was unlocked.

He wasn't sure if this surprised him. Rural Japan in 1989, a house watched by neighbors, a community where everyone knew everyone—locks were probably more formality than necessity out here. He slid the door open and stepped into the genkan, pausing to let his eyes adjust to the dimmer interior light.

The smell hit him first. Not decay—nothing had rotted here, nothing had died—but the particular mustiness of enclosed space and settled dust, of air that hadn't moved in months or years. Underneath it, fainter, the ghost of wood smoke and something floral, old incense maybe, the accumulated aromatics of a house that had been lived in for generations before it was abandoned.

Sheldon removed his shoes and stepped up onto the raised floor, the wood creaking softly beneath his weight. The hallway ahead was narrow and dark, doors opening on either side into rooms he couldn't yet see. Dust motes swirled in the light from behind him, disturbed by his passage, dancing in patterns that looked almost deliberate.

"Hello?" His voice sounded strange in the silence—too loud, too present, an intrusion into space that had grown accustomed to emptiness. No answer came. He hadn't expected one.

---

The main room was eight tatami mats, the woven surface faded and dusty but intact. Afternoon light filtered through paper screens that had yellowed with age, casting everything in sepia tones. Furniture remained—a low table in the center, cushions stacked against one wall, a cabinet with sliding doors that probably held dishes or household items. Everything was covered in a fine layer of dust, undisturbed except where Sheldon's feet had tracked through it.

Against the far wall, in the place of honor, stood a butsudan.

The family altar was small but well-made, its dark wood carved with simple patterns, its doors standing open to reveal the interior shrine. Photographs sat on the lower shelf—faces Sheldon didn't recognize, people who had lived and died in this house, whose names were probably recorded in the koseki excerpt in his wallet. His family, according to the documents. Strangers, according to his memory.

He stood before the altar for a long moment, not praying—he didn't know how, didn't know what words would be appropriate even if he wanted to speak them—but acknowledging. These people had existed. They had built this house, raised children in it, grown old and passed on and left it to whoever came after. And now he was here, the latest link in a chain he hadn't forged, inheriting a legacy he hadn't earned.

*Live well.*

The presence's words. The only instruction he'd been given. Whatever else this was—gift, obligation, cosmic accident—he was supposed to make something of it. To live, and to live well, in a life that had been constructed for him by something he didn't understand.

The butsudan waited, patient as the house itself. Sheldon bowed—shallow, awkward, the gesture of someone who knew the form but not the feeling—and moved on.

---

The bedroom was six tatami, smaller than the main room but still larger than most apartments he'd lived in during his Kyoto years. An oshiire closet took up one wall, its sliding doors closed. He opened them and found what he expected: futons, quilts, pillows, all folded and stored with the care of someone who intended to use them again. Dusty, yes. Musty from years in enclosed space. But present, and probably functional after airing out.

He had a place to sleep. That was something.

The second room was smaller still—four and a half tatami, barely enough for a desk and storage. It might have been a study once, or a room for a child. Empty now except for a small bookshelf, its contents too faded to read from the doorway. He would explore it later, when he had light and time and energy.

The kitchen was the last room on the ground floor, separated from the living areas by a narrow hallway that suggested it had been added later, expanding the original structure. A gas stove sat against one wall, its surface grimy with old cooking residue. A sink with a hand pump—old-fashioned, the kind that drew from a well or natural source rather than municipal water. Cabinets that probably held dishes and cookware, counters that would need scrubbing before they could be used.

On impulse, Sheldon tried the pump.

The handle was stiff from disuse, resisting his first pull. He worked it again, putting his weight into the motion, and felt something give—air in the pipes, maybe, or sediment being cleared. On the fourth pump, water coughed from the spout. Brown at first, rusty with age, but clearing quickly to something that looked almost drinkable. By the eighth pump it ran clear, cold, with the mineral taste of groundwater.

He had water. The pump drew from a natural source—a stream, probably, or an underground spring fed by the mountain above. Whatever arrangements had been made generations ago still held. The infrastructure was older than municipal utilities, and it still worked.

*The kitchen stove may need repair*, Uncle Kiyoshi had written. *She also says you should buy a good futon immediately.*

The futons in the closet might serve for tonight, if he could air them out. The stove would need gas connected, which meant paperwork and waiting. But he had water—clean, cold water that didn't depend on anyone reconnecting anything. One problem solved before he'd known it was solvable.

---

The engawa creaked under his weight as he stepped outside through the sliding doors in the main room. The veranda ran along the south and west sides of the house, its boards weathered but solid—mostly. He could see where some had darkened with rot, spots that would need replacing before they gave way entirely. More items for the list that was growing in his mind.

The garden spread before him, wild and overgrown, beautiful in its chaos.

What had once been a vegetable plot was now a sea of weeds, green shoots pushing through the remains of whatever had been planted last. A maple tree dominated one corner, its branches creating a canopy over a stone bench that was barely visible beneath moss and fallen leaves. Stone paths wound through the growth, their edges marked by rocks that had shifted and settled over years of neglect. And in the far corner, its trunk gnarled with age, a persimmon tree stood like a sentinel—still alive, if the buds on its branches were any indication. Still capable of bearing fruit, if someone cared for it.

A pond occupied the center of the garden, its surface choked with algae, its edges lost beneath encroaching greenery. But water glinted beneath the green—the pond was holding, still functioning as whatever it had been designed to do. Another thing that could be recovered with work.

Beyond the garden's eastern edge, through a gap in the overgrown hedge, Sheldon caught a glimpse of something larger. Water, reflecting the afternoon sky. A lake, perhaps two hundred meters away through the trees, its surface calm and mirror-bright.

He hadn't expected that. The property bordered a lake—or at least had a view of one. The stream that fed his kitchen pump probably flowed from there, carrying mountain water down through the forest to wherever it eventually joined a river. He could hear it now that he was listening: the faint sound of moving water somewhere to his left, the quiet heartbeat of the infrastructure that made this place livable.

The lake looked peaceful. Ancient. The kind of place that had been here long before the house was built, long before anyone had claimed the land around it. Whatever shrine Yamamoto had mentioned—Masaki Shrine, up the mountain—probably drew its own water from the same source. Neighbors sharing resources, the way neighbors had done for generations.

*The bones of something lovely*, Sheldon thought. That was how his grandmother would have described it. Not ruined, just waiting. Waiting for someone to see what it could become and be willing to do the work to get there.

He turned back to face the house, seeing it now from the garden's perspective. The dark wood walls, the damaged roof, the paper screens that filtered light into rooms that had been empty for years. A house that had belonged to a family named Tsukino, passed down through generations until it reached him—a man who had died in a laboratory accident in a world that no longer existed, reconstructed by something beyond his comprehension and placed here with documents that made him the legal heir to everything he saw.

It wasn't fair. None of it was fair—not his death, not his resurrection, not the fact that he was standing in a garden in rural Japan in 1989 when he should have been scattered atoms in the ruins of a containment failure. But fair had never been the relevant metric. His grandmother had taught him that. *Fair is what you make it, baby. The world gives you what it gives you. What you do with it—that's the part that's up to you.*

The sun was lower now, the light shifting from gold toward amber. Maybe two hours until dark, maybe less. He needed supplies—food, water, some way to make the house functional for at least one night. Yamamoto had mentioned a store near the shrine path, run by someone named Haruna. *Tell her Yamamoto sent you*, he'd said. *She'll help you get started.*

Sheldon took one more look at the garden, at the house, at the life that was somehow now his. Then he turned and walked back through the main room, past the butsudan with its photographs of strangers, through the dusty hallway to the genkan where his shoes waited.

He had work to do.

**Dramatic Irony Note:**
Sheldon sees a peaceful lake reflecting the sky. The reader knows Ryo-Ohki—an alien spaceship—lies dormant at the bottom, sunk after Yosho's battle 700 years ago. The ancient tree visible on shrine grounds is a crashed Juraian warship. The kindly old priest is a 700-year-old alien prince. Ryoko herself is sealed in a cave on shrine property, behind a sacred rock. Sheldon has no idea what he's living next to.
