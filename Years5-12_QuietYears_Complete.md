# PART 1: YEAR 5 (1993-1994)
## "The Second Revelation"

### 1.1 — The Year's Defining Event

**Early Summer 1993:** Sheldon tells Tenchi the truth.

(See: Year5_Tenchi_Revelation.md for complete scene framework)

**Summary:**
- Tenchi catches Sheldon working in pitch darkness
- Sheldon chooses honesty over continued deception
- Age-appropriate truth: "I'm different; I can do things others can't"
- Tenchi processes, accepts, keeps secret

### 1.2 — Aftermath of Revelation

**Immediate Changes:**
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sheldon at home | Suppressing abilities | Relaxed (around family) |
| Tenchi's awareness | "Sheru-ji is great" | "Sheru-ji is special" |
| Morning training | Hidden from Tenchi | Tenchi observes sometimes |
| Household dynamic | Two levels of secrets | One level |

**New Dynamic:**
Tenchi now shares a secret with Sheldon and Yosho. This creates an "inner circle" feeling that strengthens family bonds. He's included, not excluded.

### 1.3 — Training Focus (Year 5)

**Sheldon's Training with Yosho:**
| Focus | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Sensory control | Learning to "dial down" enhanced hearing |
| Meditation | Deeper techniques; energy awareness |
| Physical forms | Kendo basics; body discipline |
| Suppression | Intentionally damping abilities around others |

## "Tenchi Chooses Home"

> "This is my home. Grandpa and Sheru-ji are here. I don't want to leave."

**Tenchi asks about his mother.**

# PART 10: WHY TENCHI HANDLES CANON BETTER

Our Tenchi enters Year 13 with:
- 8 years of knowing Sheldon is "different"
- Experience keeping important secrets
- Stable, secure parental attachment
- Healthy model of adult relationship
- Emotional vocabulary for processing strangeness
- Trust that adults will help

Canon Tenchi had none of these. Our Tenchi is **prepared**.
