**PART V**

SHELDON CARTER --- COMPLETE PROFILE

**5.1 --- Core Identity**

Full Name: Sheldon Tsukino (née Carter)

Origin: Griffin, Georgia, USA (birthplace); raised in Jackson, Georgia

Race: Black American

Height: 5'4"

Build: Stocky

Sexuality: Gay (closeted; used work to avoid relationships)

Age at Death: 37-38 (2025)

Birth Date: August 21, 1987

**5.2 --- Education**

**5.3 --- Family**

Father: Marcus Carter --- died when Sheldon was 9 (industrial accident)

Mother: Evelyn Carter --- died when Sheldon was 12 (cancer)

Grandmother: Dorothy Mae Washington --- raised him ages 10-22; died 2009

**5.4 --- The 'Grandmother Taught Me' Rule**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: It would be ABSURD for a man with FOUR PhDs to claim his
grandmother taught him physics.\*\***

**5.5 --- Tsukino Identity**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sheldon Tsukino is NOT a cover story. Cosmos cosmically
rewrote reality --- the family genuinely exists.\*\***

Village sees: Biracial man returning to ancestral village

Actual secret: Reincarnated soul --- NOT 'dimensional traveler with
meta-knowledge'

**5.6 --- Media Consumption & Nerd Profile**

Sheldon is a nerd. Four PhDs. Postdoc in Kyoto. He engages broadly with
genre fiction, anime, manga, sci-fi, and fantasy.

Consumption Pattern

Approach: Tries things. If he likes it, watches/reads to completion. If
it crosses his lines, drops it.

Hard Lines: Harem dynamics treated as goal, incest-as-romance,
rape-as-joke, unexamined slavery/racism, lazy writing that refuses
nuance

Result: Broad surface knowledge of many properties; deep knowledge only
of things he finished

Sailor Moon Knowledge

Status: KNOWS IT --- one of the most famous anime in history

Recognition: Usagi Tsukino, magical girl, moon themes, basic cultural
osmosis

Depth: Surface level --- did not deeply engage with extended lore

*📝 When Sheldon sees 'Tsukino' on his ID, he WILL recognize it as the
Sailor Moon surname. He dismisses it as bizarre coincidence.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Dramatic irony: Cosmos literally gave him her family
name. Readers know. Sheldon doesn't understand the significance.*

Tenchi Muyo Knowledge

Status: Watched casually, DROPPED due to harem dynamics

Remembers: Maybe 1-2 names (Tenchi? Ryoko?) --- vague at best

Does NOT recognize: Masaki Shrine, Katsuhito, the cave, Funaho tree, ANY
plot details

Realization: Year 13, when Ryoko awakens --- finally connects the dots

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sheldon has NO meta-knowledge advantage for Tenchi Muyo.
He is effectively blind to where he is until Year 13.\*\***

**5.7 --- Death Circumstances (2025)**

Location: Alaska, USA

Facility: Particle accelerator laboratory (university research facility)

Cause: Cascade failure during final calibrations --- containment systems
failed sequentially

Position: Too close to the core, running final calibrations on equipment
that should have been safe

Final moment: Recognition, not fear --- a quiet 'oh' --- acceptance
rather than panic

*📝 Death was instantaneous. Sheldon looked up at exactly the wrong
moment and knew.*

Maria Chen --- Witness to Death

The last human face Sheldon saw before death. Her scream is the final
sound of his previous life.

Identity

Full Name: Maria Chen (陳美玲, Chén Měilíng)

Age at Sheldon's death: 38 years old (born 1987)

Nationality: American, second-generation Chinese-American

Position: Senior Research Physicist, Alaska Particle Research Facility

Specialization: Experimental particle physics, detector calibration

Education: PhD MIT (2014), BS Caltech (2009)

Physical Description

Height: 5'4" (163 cm)

Build: Slight, compact; moves efficiently in lab spaces

Hair: Black, straight, cut to shoulder length; usually tied back in lab

Face: Round, expressive; laugh lines at eyes; reading glasses perched on
head when not in use

Hands: Small, precise; callused from years of equipment work

Style: Practical --- jeans, button-downs, comfortable shoes; lab coat
when working

Personality

Core trait: Precise but warm --- brings cookies to late-night data
sessions

Work style: Methodical, patient; double-checks everything; catches
errors others miss

Social: Quiet in large groups, animated one-on-one; dark humor about
funding cuts

Stress response: Goes very still, very focused; doesn't panic visibly

Values: Accuracy, collaboration, mentoring junior researchers

Relationship with Sheldon

How they met: Joined Alaska facility 2022; Sheldon was senior researcher
who helped her adjust

Professional dynamic: Mutual respect; different specializations but
overlapping projects

Personal connection: Shared meals in cafeteria; talked about non-physics
things; comfortable silences

Depth: Close colleagues, approaching genuine friendship; neither had
many friends

What she called him: 'Sheldon' --- one of few who didn't use
'Dr. Carter'

What he called her: 'Maria' --- appreciated her directness

*📝 Not romantic. Two lonely people who found professional kinship in an
isolated facility.*

The Day of the Accident (2025)

Her role: Running detector calibration in adjacent control room

Position: Behind 3-inch safety glass observation window

What she saw: Cascade failure beginning --- loss of containment, energy
surge, Sheldon looking up

What she did: Screamed his name; slammed emergency shutdown (too late);
pounded on glass

What she heard: Nothing --- glass swallowed her scream; roar of failing
accelerator

Duration: Perhaps 4 seconds from first warning to\... nothing

Last image: Sheldon's face turning toward the light, expression of
recognition, then white

After Sheldon's Death

Immediate: Collapsed against glass; found by emergency responders;
treated for shock

Investigation: Interviewed repeatedly; her calibration data proved the
failure wasn't human error

Leave: Mandatory 6 weeks; extended to 3 months at her request

Therapy: Facility-mandated counseling; diagnosed with acute stress
disorder

Return: Came back to facility but couldn't enter that wing; transferred
to remote data analysis

Current status (2025): Still employed; working from Anchorage office;
hasn't been on-site since

What Haunts Her

The glass: She was RIGHT THERE and couldn't do anything

The silence: Her scream made no sound that mattered

The recognition: She thinks Sheldon saw her in that last moment; she
thinks he knew

The question: Could she have noticed the failure earlier? (No, but she
asks anyway)

Survivor's guilt: Why was she behind glass and he was in the chamber?

Story Function

Narrative: Grounds Sheldon's death in human cost; someone mourns him

Contrast: Sheldon thinks he died unmourned, but Maria carries him

Potential: If story ever returns to 2025 timeline, Maria is the POV for
that world

Thematic: Connection exists even when we don't see it; Sheldon mattered
to someone

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Sheldon remembers her face frozen in horror. He doesn't
know she still thinks of him. He assumes he was forgotten.*

**5.8 --- Pre-Death Medical History**

Sheldon's body at 37 carried the accumulated wear of years. All
conditions erased by Cosmos's restoration.

Cardiovascular

Resting heart rate: 78 bpm (elevated from ideal)

Rhythm: Irregular --- skipping every few beats

Diagnosis: Benign PVCs (premature ventricular contractions)

Prognosis: 'Nothing to worry about yet' --- follow-up appointment
scheduled

Family history: Father died of heart attack at 34; grandfather at 41 ---
Sheldon monitored carefully

Musculoskeletal

Back pain: Chronic low-grade, started in graduate school

Cause: Too many hours hunched over desks, sleeping on laboratory couches

Severity: Constant presence, not debilitating --- body used as tool
rather than treated as home

Arthritis: Early signs in knuckles, diagnosed \~2022 (age 44)

Doctor's words: 'Common in men your age, especially men who work with
their hands. Nothing to worry about yet, but we should keep an eye on
it.'

Vision

Condition: Mild myopia (nearsightedness)

Onset: Age 12 --- glasses prescribed

Severity: Not dramatic, but enough to blur edges of world without
correction

Last prescription: Stable for years, minor adjustments only

**5.9 --- Pre-Death Possessions (For Contrast)**

What Sheldon owned before death --- contrasts with Cosmos's thoughtful
provisions:

Wallet: Black synthetic, bought at Target in Berkeley \~2018 because old
one fell apart

Watch: Digital Casio --- practical, ugly, abandoned in drawer \~2015
when phone made it redundant

Handkerchief: None --- stopped carrying during Caltech years (PhD #3),
deemed 'too old-fashioned'

*📝 Cosmos restored not just his body but his grandmother's standards.
The handkerchief's return is pointed.*

**5.10 --- Postdoctoral Work**

Location: Kyoto University, Japan

Timing: \~15 years before death (circa 2010)

Significance: Source of Japanese language proficiency and cultural
familiarity

*📝 This is why Sheldon can speak Japanese (though rusty from disuse)
and recognizes seasonal/cultural elements.*

**5.11 --- Grandmother Dorothy Mae --- Complete Teachings Archive**

Dorothy Mae Washington (1926-2009) raised Sheldon from age 10 to 22. Her
teachings shaped who he became. This section serves as the authoritative
reference for her wisdom.

**5.11.1 --- Dorothy Mae: Profile**

Full Name: Dorothy Mae Washington (née Johnson)

Birth: 1926, rural Georgia

Death: 2009 (age 83) --- Sheldon was 31

Relationship: Paternal grandmother; raised Sheldon after parents' deaths

Occupation: Domestic worker, later retired; church deaconess

Education: 8th grade (common for her generation); self-educated reader

Character: Practical, no-nonsense, deeply religious, fiercely loving,
proud

Speech patterns: Southern Georgia cadence; called Sheldon 'baby' or
'child'; occasional Biblical references

Physical: Small, sturdy, hands rough from decades of work; always wore
an apron in the kitchen

*📝 Dorothy Mae is Sheldon's moral compass. Her voice appears in his
head during moments of decision or domestic ritual.*

**5.11.2 --- Core Values (Explicit Teachings)**

The Handkerchief Rule

"A gentleman keeps a handkerchief. You never know when you'll need to
wipe your face or help a lady with her tears or clean up a mess. A man
without a handkerchief is a man who isn't prepared for life."

Taught: Around age 10-11

Compliance: Carried handkerchief through high school, college, first two
PhDs --- stopped at Caltech

Significance: Cosmos including a handkerchief is restoration of
grandmother's standards

The Self-Sufficiency Mandate

"A man who can't feed himself isn't a man at all."

Implementation: By age 12, Sheldon could make biscuits from scratch,
season cast iron, recognize done greens by smell

Result: Cooking became his anchor across all relocations and career
phases

The Survival Priorities

"Water, food, shelter. In that order. Everything else can wait."

Context: Summer camping trips in the Georgia hills

Application (Day 1): Sheldon's first priorities after standing --- find
water, then food, then shelter before dark

The Work Ethic

"Idle hands are the devil's workshop. If you don't have work, find some.
There's always something needs doing."

Application (Day 2): Sheldon immediately asks for work; cannot sit idle
while others labor

The Hospitality Rule

"When someone opens their home to you, you don't sit there like
furniture. You help. You contribute. You make yourself useful or you
make yourself gone."

Application: Drives Sheldon's discomfort with accepting charity; must
contribute to earn his place

The Pride Warning

"Don't let those white boys make you feel small. And don't let them make
you feel big, either. Pride goes before a fall."

Context: Said when she put him on the bus to MIT, age 22

Meaning: Navigate the world with dignity but without arrogance; know
your worth without needing to prove it

**5.11.3 --- Domestic Teachings (Practical Skills)**

The Dish-Washing Order

"Cleanest first, dirtiest last. Rinse everything twice. Don't waste
water, but don't cut corners either."

Method: Glasses first, then silverware, then plates, then pots and pans

Application (Scene 10): Sheldon washes dishes at shrine following this
exact order

The Sweeping Method

"Long strokes, baby. Don't peck at it like a chicken. Sweep like you
mean it."

Additional: 'Start from the far corner, work toward the door. Don't
sweep yourself into a corner.'

Application: Katsuhito's technique is different (Japanese style) but the
principle of thoroughness applies

The Kitchen Cleanliness Standard

"A dirty kitchen is a sick kitchen. Clean as you go. Never leave a mess
for tomorrow."

Method: Wipe surfaces immediately, wash cutting boards between
ingredients, keep floor swept

Legacy: Sheldon cannot cook in a dirty space; must clean first

The Bed-Making Rule

"First thing when you wake up, make your bed. Starts the day right. A
made bed means a made mind."

Hospital corners: Taught properly; sheets tight enough to bounce a
quarter

Application: Even on Day 2, Sheldon will fold the futon properly before
leaving the room

The Laundry Wisdom

"Sort by color, wash in cold if you're not sure, and for heaven's sake
don't put a red sock in with the whites."

Ironing: Sunday evenings; everything pressed; domestic work as devotion

Folding: Specific methods for shirts, pants, towels; everything has its
place

**5.11.4 --- Food & Cooking Teachings**

The Cast Iron Commandment

"Never let soap touch cast iron. Never. Hot water, salt, and elbow
grease. That seasoning took sixty years to build."

Context: Her grandmother's skillet, passed down

Sheldon's loss: That skillet presumably still exists in 2025; he'll
never hold it again

The Biscuit Secret

"Cold butter. Cold hands. Don't overwork the dough. The less you touch
it, the better it rises."

Taught: Age 11-12

Result: Sheldon can make perfect biscuits by feel alone

The Greens Wisdom

"Low and slow, baby. You can't rush greens. Put on the ham hock, put on
the lid, and let the Lord do His work."

Smell test: Sheldon knows greens are done by smell before looking

The Waste Prohibition

"Waste not, want not. There's children starving and you're going to
throw away good food? Finish your plate or don't take so much."

Application: Sheldon cannot leave food on his plate; cleans every grain
of rice

**5.11.5 --- Formative Moments**

The Apple Peeling Lesson (Age 8)

Teaching: 'Not toward yourself, baby, away, always away'

What happened: Paring knife slipped --- blood, crying, dish towel
pressed tight

Her response: 'Hush now, hush, you're all right, let me see, let me see'

Result: Thin white scar across pad of right thumb, carried for 40 years

Post-resurrection: Scar is gone --- one of first changes Sheldon notices

The Sunday Ironing Ritual

When: Every Sunday evening, after church

Setup: Ironing board in living room, television softly playing

What she ironed: Shirts, slacks, pillowcases, handkerchiefs --- each
pressed with equal care

Significance: Smoothing wrinkles as prayer; domestic work as devotion

Echo: The handkerchief's sharp creases are exactly as Dorothy Mae would
have done

The Departure (1987)

Event: Dorothy Mae put Sheldon on a bus to Boston for MIT

She gave him: A suitcase and a shoe box full of home-cooked food

Final instruction: 'Don't let those white boys make you feel small'

His age: 22 years old

Significance: Last major domestic moment; after this, he was on his own

Her Death (January 2009)

Date: January 14, 2009 --- a Wednesday, cold and clear

Sheldon's age: 31

Cause: Congestive heart failure --- her heart simply wore out

Progression: Gradual decline over 6 months; she knew it was coming;
refused to go to hospital

Her words: 'I'm going home to Jesus, baby. You can't stop that and I
don't want you to try.'

Sheldon's Presence

Where he was: Stanford, finishing PhD #2 (Applied Mathematics)

The call: Neighbor found her unresponsive; called Sheldon; he caught
next flight to Georgia

Timing: Arrived 6 hours after she passed --- missed her by less than a
day

What he found: House exactly as she left it; ironing board still up; her
Bible open on the table

Last chapter she read: Psalm 23 --- 'Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death'

The Funeral

Location: Mount Zion Baptist Church, the church she'd attended for 60
years

Attendance: Overflowing; people Sheldon had never met who knew her for
decades

He learned: How many people she had helped; how many lives she had
touched; how little he really knew

His role: Sat in front pew, accepted condolences, said nothing; couldn't
find words

What he wore: The suit she bought him for his first PhD defense; it
still fit

The Aftermath

The house: Sheldon inherited it; couldn't bear to sell it; pays taxes,
never visits

Her things: Packed nothing; house remains exactly as she left it; shrine
to absence

The skillet: Her grandmother's cast iron; still in the kitchen; 60 years
of seasoning

His response: Threw himself into work; finished PhD in 4 months; started
next program immediately

Processing: None. He never grieved properly. Buried it in equations and
lab hours.

The Drift Begins

Before her death: Sheldon called weekly; had someone to report to;
maintained human connection

After: No one to call; no anchor; work became everything because nothing
else remained

Pattern: Each new degree, each new position, moved further from human
connection

Endpoint: Alaska --- as far as he could go; as isolated as he could get;
16 years later, he died alone

*🎭 THEME: Dorothy Mae's death didn't just take his grandmother. It took
his last reason to stay connected to humanity.*

*📝 Her death is part of why Sheldon was alone at the end. The
handkerchief Cosmos gave him is pointed: 'I know what you lost. I know
who raised you. I'm giving that back.'*

**5.11.6 --- Voice Patterns for Dialogue/Memory**

When Dorothy Mae speaks in Sheldon's memory, use these patterns:

Terms of endearment: 'baby,' 'child,' 'Sheldon honey'

Emphasis: Repeats for emphasis: 'let me see, let me see' / 'hush now,
hush'

Cadence: Southern Georgia rhythm; slightly slower; words given weight

Faith references: 'the Lord,' 'heaven's sake,' Biblical allusions

Practical framing: Always connects abstract virtue to concrete action

Never says: Academic language, modern slang, anything that sounds
'educated'

*📝 Her voice should feel WARM but FIRM. Love expressed through
teaching, not sentiment.*

**5.12 --- Arrival Inventory (April 3, 1989)**

Items Sheldon found on his person upon awakening --- all provided by
Cosmos. She is a mother setting her son up to succeed, not stranding him
with nothing.

Clothing

-   Gray slacks --- well-fitted, unremarkable, single pleat, no cuffs

-   White button-down shirt --- clean, simple, cotton blend, no pocket

-   Black leather belt --- simple buckle, worn but serviceable

-   Black shoes --- simple oxford style, comfortable, broken-in feel

-   White undershirt --- cotton, crew neck

-   Dark socks --- cotton, mid-calf

*📝 All clothing is of good quality but deliberately nondescript.
Japanese sizing (not American). Nothing to draw attention.*

The Wallet (Detailed)

Material: Brown leather, genuine but not expensive

Condition: Worn at edges, softened from apparent use --- looks like it's
been carried for years

Style: Bi-fold, Japanese standard size (fits yen notes without folding)

Pockets: Bill compartment, coin pouch with snap closure, 4 card slots, 2
hidden pockets

Position when found: Right rear trouser pocket --- natural position

**5.12.1 --- Japanese Residence Card (在留カード / Gaikokujin Tōroku**

*📝 This backstory explains: American name, American birth, Japanese
family registry, return to ancestral village.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: The 'American serviceman father' is entirely fictional
--- but Cosmos may have based him on elements of Sheldon's actual
father.*

Letter Content (Translated Summary)

"To Whom It May Concern in Kamogata Town,

I write to introduce my nephew, Tsukino Sheldon. He is the son of my
late younger sister Yuki, who passed in 1985. Sheldon was born in
America where my sister had emigrated, but he has always felt a
connection to his mother's homeland.

After completing his studies, Sheldon wishes to return to the village of
his ancestors. Our family still owns property there, though it has been
empty since we moved to Osaka for work. He is educated, speaks Japanese
(his mother taught him), and is of good character.

I humbly request that the good people of Kamogata assist him as he
establishes himself. Any kindness shown to him honors our family.

With deepest respect, Tsukino Kiyoshi, Osaka, April 1987"

*📝 This letter is never shown to anyone in-story (yet). It's social
proof Sheldon carries but hasn't needed.*

5.12.A --- The Tsukino Family (Cosmos's Creation)

Cosmos didn't just create documents --- she created a family. These
people EXISTED in the rewritten reality. Their lives, deaths, and
memories are real within the world's history.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is NOT a cover story. Cosmos rewrote causality. The
Tsukino family genuinely existed. Records exist. People remember them.
Sheldon is genuinely their relative --- because Cosmos made it so.\*\***

Tsukino Takeo --- 'Grandfather'

Full Name: 月野 武雄 (Tsukino Takeo)

Born: 1925, Kamogata village

Died: 1978 (age 53), Kamogata --- heart attack

Occupation: Farmer, later factory worker in Osaka

Personality: Quiet, hardworking, traditional; rarely spoke of daughter
and grandson in America

Marriage: Married young; wife died in childbirth with Yuki (1940)

Relationship to Sheldon: Never met his grandson --- Yuki was already
pregnant when she left for America

What villagers remember: 'Takeo-san was a good man. Quiet. Worked hard.
Died too young. His daughter went to America --- we heard she had a child
there.'

*📝 Takeo is buried in the village cemetery. Sheldon could visit the
grave.*

Tsukino Yuki --- 'Mother'

Full Name: 月野 雪 (Tsukino Yuki)

Born: 1940, Kamogata village (Takeo's only child; mother died in childbirth)

Died: 1985 (age 45), Osaka --- cancer

Occupation: Housewife in Japan; factory worker in America; returned to
Japan 1980

Marriage: Married James Carter (American serviceman) 1958 in California;
divorced 1970

Personality: Strong-willed, determined; taught Sheldon Japanese; wanted
him to know his heritage

What happened: After divorce, struggled in America; returned to Japan
1980 to live with brother Kiyoshi in Osaka; died of cancer 1985

Relationship to Sheldon: Raised him until age 11 (in created history),
then\... \[see Timeline Gap below\]

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Yuki's face in the photo may echo Ikuko Tsukino ---
Usagi's mother. Cosmos creating a mother for Sheldon by drawing on her
own.*

James Carter --- 'American Father'

Full Name: James Edward Carter

Born: 1932, Georgia, USA

Died: 1982, USA --- car accident

Occupation: Initially US Air Force (stationed in Japan 1957-58), later
mechanic

How they met: Yuki worked at a restaurant near the base; romance; she
became pregnant

Marriage: Married Yuki 1958 in California after she immigrated

Divorce: 1970 --- grew apart; he drank; she was homesick

Relationship to Sheldon: Distant father; Sheldon took mother's maiden
name after parents' divorce

Why 'Carter' appears in koseki: Yuki briefly took his name; notation
shows 'formerly Tsukino-Carter'

*📝 James Carter may be inspired by Sheldon's ACTUAL father from his
previous life --- Cosmos weaving truth into fiction.*

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sheldon's REAL grandmother was Dorothy Mae. In created
history, he was raised by Yuki until 11, then\... the Gap.\*\***

Tsukino Kiyoshi --- 'Uncle' (ALIVE)

Full Name: 月野 清 (Tsukino Kiyoshi)

Born: 1935, Kamogata village

Current Age: 54 in 1989

Status: ALIVE --- living in Osaka

Address: 大阪府大阪市東淀川区\... (Higashiyodogawa-ku, Osaka)

Occupation: Retired; former factory foreman at textile plant

Relation: Maternal uncle --- Yuki's older brother (Takeo's son from second marriage)

Family: Wife Haruko (52), two adult children: son Masaru (28) and
daughter Akemi (25); grandchildren

Personality: Dutiful, traditional, family-oriented; feels guilt about
abandoned village property

Health: Good health for his age; could potentially travel to Kamogata

What Kiyoshi 'Remembers'

Cosmos rewrote his memories. To Kiyoshi, the following is genuinely
true:

-   His sister Yuki married an American and went to America in 1958

-   Yuki sent letters and photos over the years; he has a box of them

-   He met Sheldon ONCE --- when Yuki returned to Japan in 1980, she
    brought the boy (age 21) to visit

-   Sheldon was quiet, polite, spoke good Japanese; clearly Yuki's
    son

-   After Yuki died (1985), Kiyoshi wrote to Sheldon offering family
    connection

-   Sheldon came to Japan in 1987; stayed with Kiyoshi briefly; then
    went to 'find himself'

-   Kiyoshi hasn't seen him since but exchanges occasional letters

**⚠️ CRITICAL: If Sheldon visits Kiyoshi, the old man will recognize
him. Kiyoshi has REAL memories of meeting Sheldon. Cosmos made it
so.\*\***

The Letters from 'Sheldon'

**Kiyoshi has received letters from Sheldon over the past two years:**

Letter 1 (May 1987): 'Thank you for your hospitality. I am traveling to
see Japan. I will write again.'

Letter 2 (August 1987): 'I am in Kyoto. Studying. Thinking about what to
do with my life.'

Letter 3 (January 1988): 'I spent New Year alone. Thinking of mother.
Thank you for the omamori you sent.'

Letter 4 (June 1988): 'I have been working odd jobs. I am considering
returning to Kamogata to see the family land.'

Letter 5 (December 1988): 'Happy New Year. I may come to the village in
spring.'

*📝 These letters are in Kiyoshi's possession. They are in Sheldon's
handwriting (Cosmos created them). They form a paper trail.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: If Sheldon writes to Kiyoshi, his handwriting will
match. If Kiyoshi visits, he will recognize Sheldon. The identity is
REAL.*

Tsukino Hana --- 'Great-Grandmother'

Full Name: 月野 ハナ (Tsukino Hana)

Born: 1898, Kamogata

Died: 1979 (age 81), one year after her son Takeo

Role: Takeo's mother; Sheldon's great-grandmother; matriarch who kept the family in village

What villagers remember: 'Hana-san lived to see her son die. Passed the
next year. Some say of grief.'

In photo: The elderly woman in kimono, gentle smile (1977, two years before her death)

*📝 Hana is buried next to Takeo in village cemetery.*

5.12.B --- The Timeline Gap (1987-1989)

The ID shows Sheldon registered as foreign resident in April 1987. The
story begins April 1989. Where was he for two years?

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is NOT a plot hole. Cosmos created a complete
two-year history. Sheldon simply doesn't REMEMBER it --- because he
wasn't conscious for it.\*\***

The Official History (What Records Show)

April 1987: Sheldon Tsukino arrives in Japan from USA; registers as
foreign resident in Osaka

April-May 1987: Stays with uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka; gets bearings; writes
letter of introduction

May-Dec 1987: Travels Japan; works odd jobs; 'finding himself' after
mother's death

Jan-Dec 1988: Continues traveling; occasional letters to uncle; deposits
money in bank accounts

Jan-Mar 1989: Records go quiet; Sheldon 'off the grid' for final months

April 3, 1989: Awakens in field with no memory of the past two years

The Truth (What Actually Happened)

Cosmos created the paper trail retroactively. She placed memories in
Kiyoshi's mind, letters in his box, transactions in bank records. The
two years of history are REAL in every verifiable sense --- but Sheldon
never lived them.

What Sheldon knows: Nothing. He has no memories between death (2025) and
awakening (April 3, 1989).

What he can discover: If he investigates, he'll find a complete history
he doesn't remember living.

Potential crisis: If someone asks 'What were you doing last month?' he
cannot answer.

The Cover Story (If Asked)

Sheldon doesn't have a prepared story because he doesn't know he needs
one. If pressed:

Vague version: 'I was traveling. Thinking. After my mother died, I
needed time.'

If pressed harder: 'I don't remember clearly. It's been difficult.'
(True --- he genuinely doesn't remember)

Red flag: Medical professional might suspect head injury or dissociative
episode

*📝 This vulnerability is INTENTIONAL. Cosmos wants Sheldon to build
real relationships, not rely on fabricated history.*

The Address Problem

Issue: ID shows Tsukino house as registered address, but house is
empty/abandoned

Resolution: This is normal in rural Japan. Family register address ≠
current residence. Many people maintain honke (ancestral home)
registration while living elsewhere.

What officials would assume: 'He's registered at family property but was
living elsewhere while traveling. Now returning to claim it.'

*📝 Not suspicious. Completely normal for someone 'returning to
ancestral village.'*

5.12.C --- Village Memory of the Tsukinos

Older Kamogata residents remember the Tsukino family. Sheldon may
encounter these memories.

What Villagers Remember

The family: 'The Tsukinos farmed that land for generations. Good people.
Quiet.'

Takeo: 'Takeo-san worked hard. Didn't talk much after his wife left for
America.'

Yuki leaving: 'Scandal at the time. A young woman running off with an
American. But it was the '50s. Things were different after the war.'

Hana: 'Old Hana-san kept that family together. Died a year after her
son.'

The move to Osaka: 'Kiyoshi took the family to the city. More
opportunities. The young ones all left.'

The empty house: 'Shame to see it sitting there. They still pay taxes.
Say they'll come back someday.'

The shop: 'The old Tsukino shop? Closed when they moved. Used to sell
sundries. Good pickles.'

Who Might Remember

Elderly neighbors: Anyone over 60 likely knew the Tsukinos directly

Shrine connection: Katsuhito may remember them --- the shrine serves the
whole community

Shop customers: Older villagers might remember buying from the Tsukino
shop

School connections: Takeo and Kiyoshi went to local school; former
classmates may remain

Potential Encounters

At shrine: 'You're the Tsukino boy? From America? I knew your father.'

At shop in town: 'Tsukino? Like the family that had the shop? Are you
related?'

At cemetery: 'I saw you at the graves. Are you family? I used to bring
Hana-san her groceries.'

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Village memory can validate Sheldon's identity --- or
create awkward moments when he doesn't know things he 'should' know.*

5.12.D --- The Tsukino Graves

The family cemetery plot is in the village. Sheldon may be expected to
visit.

Location

Cemetery: Community cemetery on hillside, 10-minute walk from shrine

Tsukino plot: Family section near the back; three headstones plus family
marker

Condition: Overgrown but not neglected; Kiyoshi pays for annual
maintenance

The Graves

Family marker: Stone pillar inscribed '月野家之墓' (Tsukino Family
Grave)

NOT buried here: Yuki (cremated in Osaka, ashes with Kiyoshi), James
Carter (died in USA)

What Sheldon 'Should' Do

Social expectation: A returning family member should visit the graves,
clean them, burn incense

What Sheldon knows: Nothing about grave locations or rituals --- has to
ask or figure it out

Story opportunity: Katsuhito could offer to show him; moment of
unexpected kindness

Emotional weight: Sheldon standing at graves of 'family' he never knew,
feeling like a fraud

*🎭 THEME: The graves are real. The bodies are real. Only Sheldon's
memories are absent.*

5.12.E --- Kiyoshi's Keepsakes

In Osaka, Tsukino Kiyoshi has a box of family history. If Sheldon
visits, he might see these.

The Box

Location: Kiyoshi's home in Osaka, stored in tansu (chest)

Contents: Letters, photos, documents spanning decades

Condition: Well-preserved; Kiyoshi is sentimental about family

Contents --- From Yuki in America

Letters (1958-1980): \~50 letters from Yuki over 22 years; chronicle
of her American life

Photos of 'Sheldon': Baby photos, school photos, graduation --- showing
him grow up

Birth certificate copy: Sheldon James Carter, born March 15, 1959,
Oakland, California

News clipping: Small article about Sheldon winning a science fair (1973)

*📝 These items exist because Cosmos created them. They would pass
forensic examination.*

Contents --- Family History

Tsukino family koseki: Full family registry going back generations

Old photos: Takeo and Kiyoshi as children; their parents; the farmhouse
when occupied

Deed copies: Property documents for house, land, and shop

Takeo's death certificate: 1978, cause of death: acute myocardial
infarction

What This Means

Complete paper trail: Every document someone might ask for EXISTS

Consistent memories: Kiyoshi's memories match the documents

Undeniable identity: Sheldon IS Tsukino Sheldon in every verifiable
sense

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Cosmos didn't create a cover story. She created a LIFE.
The only thing missing is Sheldon's memory of living it.\*\***

**5.12.5 --- Family Photograph**

A small photograph providing visual reference for 'family' Sheldon has
never actually met.

Physical Description

Size: Standard wallet size, \~9cm × 6cm

Paper: Photo paper, slightly faded edges, appears \~10 years old

Condition: Handled often; soft at corners; kept in wallet's photo sleeve

Image Content

Setting: Front of a modest house (the Tsukino house, when occupied)

Date: Appears to be late 1970s based on clothing/colors

Season: Spring --- cherry blossoms visible in corner

People in Photograph (left to right)

1\. Elderly woman: \~79, kimono, gentle smile --- 'Great-Grandmother'
Tsukino Hana (Takeo's mother, died 1979)

2\. Middle-aged man: \~52, work clothes, stern but kind face ---
'Grandfather' Tsukino Takeo

3\. Young woman: \~37, simple dress, warm smile ---
'Mother' Tsukino Yuki

4\. Young man: \~42, casual clothes, standing protectively near sister ---
'Uncle' Tsukino Kiyoshi (the letter writer)

Back: Handwritten in faded ink: '月野家 昭和52年' (Tsukino Family, 1977)

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Cosmos created these faces. They may unconsciously echo
her own mortal family --- Usagi's parents, family she lost. Sheldon can
never know this.*

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sheldon has NEVER MET these people. They are entirely
Cosmos's creation. When he looks at this photo, he feels nothing --- and
wonders if he should.\*\***

**5.12.6 --- Bankbooks (通帳)**

Two bankbooks proving financial accounts and providing withdrawal
access.

Chūgoku Bank Passbook

Bank: 株式会社中国銀行 (Chūgoku Bank, Ltd.) --- major Okayama regional
bank

Branch: 鴨方支店 (Kamogata Branch)

Account Number: 普通 1234567

Account Holder: 月野 シェルドン

Current Balance: ¥500,000

Color: Dark blue cover with gold bank logo

Transaction History: Shows deposits from 'April 1987' onward --- initial
deposit ¥300,000, periodic additions

*📝 Transaction history creates illusion of two years of normal
financial life.*

Postal Savings Passbook

Institution: 郵便貯金 (Postal Savings) --- government-run, accessible at
any post office

Type: 通常貯金 (Ordinary Savings)

Account Number: 記号 15230 番号 98765432

Account Holder: 月野 シェルドン

Current Balance: ¥297,000

Color: Green cover with postal logo

Advantage: Can withdraw at any post office in Japan --- important for
rural areas

Other Pocket Items

-   Loose change --- ¥470 in left trouser pocket (detailed above)

-   No keys --- no residence yet

-   No pen --- didn't need one for the journey

-   No bag --- traveled light; all possessions on person

**5.12.7 --- The Wristwatch (Detailed)**

Make: Seiko --- Japanese brand, appropriate for 1989

Model: Dress watch, not sport --- suitable for professional/casual wear

Case: Silver-toned stainless steel, approximately 30mm diameter

Face: White dial with black hands (hour, minute, second) and small black
numerals at hours

Movement: Mechanical (automatic) --- requires winding, smooth
second-hand motion

Strap: Brown leather, worn soft with apparent use (or made to appear so)

Position when found: Left wrist, buckled comfortably

Time shown at discovery: 2:47 PM (accurate to actual time)

Significance: Someone buckled this to his wrist while he was unconscious
--- intimate act of care

*📝 Contrasts with his pre-death digital Casio abandoned in 2015. This
watch requires attention, exists as object not just function.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: The watch is wound. It was placed on his wrist while
running. Cosmos touches him as she sends him away.*

**5.12.8 --- The Handkerchief (Detailed)**

Material: White cotton, high thread count, quality fabric

Size: Standard men's handkerchief, \~40cm × 40cm when unfolded

Condition: Clean, pressed, sharp creases from careful ironing

Fold: Neat square, exactly as Dorothy Mae would have folded it --- four
quarters, then in half

Location: Right front trouser pocket

Monogram: None --- plain white

Significance: Sheldon stopped carrying handkerchiefs at Caltech ---
Cosmos restored his grandmother's standards

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Holding this handkerchief, Sheldon thinks of Sunday
evenings, the ironing board, his grandmother's hands. This is Cosmos
saying: 'I know who raised you.'*

**5.12.9 --- Items Absent (With Reason)**

No glasses: Vision corrected by Cosmos --- he no longer needs them

No phone: 1989 Japan; consumer cell phones don't exist

No keys: No residence yet --- he must find/earn his place

No credit cards: Rural Japan 1989 is cash-based; bankbooks serve same
purpose

No passport: He's a 'permanent resident' --- doesn't need one for
domestic ID

No photographs of previous life: That life is over; Cosmos doesn't give
him false comfort

No American documents: His American identity doesn't exist; he is now
Tsukino Sheldon

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Every absence is deliberate. Cosmos gave him what he
NEEDS, not what he might WANT. The gaps are lessons.\*\***

**5.12.10 --- Complete Inventory Summary**

Quick reference for what Sheldon has on his person, April 3, 1989:

**5.12.11 --- What This Inventory MEANS**

**Cosmos's choices reveal her nature and intentions:**

IDENTITY: Not a cover story but a rewritten reality. The Tsukino family
existed, the documents are genuine, the history is real. She didn't
forge --- she created.

FINANCES: Enough to survive for years, not enough to be wealthy. Forces
engagement with world, not isolation.

DOCUMENTS: Complete but not excessive. Everything needed to prove who he
is, nothing more.

CLOTHING: Professional but nondescript. He can meet anyone, go anywhere,
draw no attention.

HANDKERCHIEF: A whisper of his grandmother. 'I know who raised you. I
honor that.'

WATCH: Requires winding. Exists as object, not function. 'Pay attention
to time.'

WHAT'S MISSING: No past. No comfort objects. No way back. 'This is your
life now.'

*🎭 THEME: Cosmos set up the board. Every piece is where it needs to be.
Now Sheldon must play.*

**5.13 --- Physical Restoration**

Cosmos restored Sheldon to optimal physical condition. Each change
contrasts with his pre-death state:

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sheldon notices these changes gradually during Scenes
1-4. He catalogs them methodically but does not yet understand their
significance.\*\***

**5.14 --- Cognitive & Linguistic Restoration**

Cosmos did not merely restore Sheldon's body --- she restored (and
possibly enhanced) the cognitive tools he needs to survive and thrive in
Japan.

The Provision Principle

"Cosmos would not fix his eyesight but leave him unable to communicate.
She would not create documentation but leave him unable to explain
himself. She would not place him in Japan but leave his Japanese
degraded. Every survival need was anticipated and addressed."

Japanese Language --- Fully Restored

Pre-death state: Fluent from Kyoto years (\~2010), but 15 years of
disuse would have caused significant atrophy

Post-resurrection state: Fully fluent --- as good as or better than his
peak in Kyoto

Sheldon's experience: Surprised at how easily it flows; words come
without searching; another gift from whoever rebuilt him

Narrative function: Allows natural conversation; removes artificial
barrier; focuses drama on actual challenges

**What Restoration Includes:**

Vocabulary: Full professional and conversational range, including
academic register from conference presentations

Grammar: Natural sentence construction, appropriate formality levels,
particle usage

Listening comprehension: Full speed, including regional accents and
colloquialisms

Reading: Kanji recognition at educated adult level, including unusual
characters

Cultural fluency: Appropriate bowing, gift-giving norms, indirect
communication patterns, seasonal references

Speech patterns: Natural rhythm and intonation, not 'foreigner Japanese'

**What Restoration Does NOT Include:**

Okayama dialect: Sheldon learned Tokyo/Kansai Japanese; he'll need to
adapt to local speech patterns

1989-specific slang: His Japanese is from 2010; some terms may be
anachronistic

Complete cultural omniscience: He knows Kyoto well; rural Okayama is
different

*📝 These gaps create organic learning opportunities without creating
artificial incompetence.*

**Why This Matters Narratively:**

Removes false obstacles: Communication struggles would be artificial
given Cosmos's established thoroughness

Creates real observations: Sheldon can notice and reflect on
interactions, not just struggle through them

Allows relationship depth: He can have real conversations from Day 1,
building genuine connections

Honors the character: A man with four PhDs and years in Japan would BE
fluent; anything else diminishes him

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Sheldon's fluency surprises him --- another data point
suggesting deliberate restoration, not random resurrection.*

**5.15 --- Personal Timeline Milestones**

Key events in Sheldon's life with specific dates/ages for reference:

*📝 Timeline paradox: Sheldon died in 2025 at age 37 but awakens in 1989
at apparent age \~30. He has memories of a future that hasn't happened
yet.*

**5.16 --- Day 1 Physical State Tracking**

The restored body still has physical needs. Cosmos created a functional
human, not an automaton.

Unknown Initial State

Question: When did this body last eat, drink, or eliminate?

Answer: Unknown --- the body was 'given to him already running, like a
car left idling at the curb'

Sheldon's thought: 'Had the body simply been created empty, a vessel
waiting to be filled with the ordinary debris of living?'

*📝 This remains a philosophical mystery. Cosmos's exact methods are not
explained.*

Physical Needs Timeline --- Day 1

Implication: These needs confirm Sheldon is fully human --- not a
construct or projection

Priority established: Water → food → shelter (grandmother's rule)

Body Awareness During Movement

Walking sensation: Every step felt distinctly --- compression of soil,
flex of ankle, push of toes

Comparison: 'This was what it felt like to be young' --- the body's
assumption that it could do anything

Key realization: 'Youth wasn't the absence of age --- it was the
presence of something else'

Result: For the first time in decades, Sheldon moves without thinking
about his body at all
