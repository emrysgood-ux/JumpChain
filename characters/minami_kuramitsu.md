## Characterization

### Leadership Style
- Pragmatic and experienced
- Balances bureaucratic demands with operational needs
- Protective of family members in service

### The Mihoshi Problem
Minami faces a unique command challenge with his granddaughter:
- Mihoshi's performance record is technically impressive (cases solved)
- Her methods are catastrophically destructive (collateral damage)
- Her "luck" produces results that defy explanation
- Political pressure to either promote or discharge her
- Minami's solution: assign her to remote postings where damage is limited

### Stance on Anomalies
Like most senior GP officials, Minami is aware that:
- Certain individuals defy normal classification
- Some operations require looking the other way
- The Masaki household on Earth is a known "special situation"
- Direct interference with certain cosmic-level beings is inadvisable
