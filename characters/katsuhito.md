Appearance: Elderly man (illusion) --- true form young adult

Royal Tree: Funaho (1st gen, rooted at shrine)

**7.2.1 --- Katsuhito at First Meeting (Illusioned Form)**

What Sheldon sees when he first meets Katsuhito --- the elderly priest
illusion:

Physical Appearance (Illusion)

Apparent age: Late 60s to early 70s

Height: \~170 cm (5'7") --- average; slightly stooped with apparent age

Build: Lean, wiry; looks like a man who has done physical work his whole
life

Hair: Gray, shoulder-length, tied back in simple ponytail; receding at
temples

Face: Weathered, lined; kind eyes behind round glasses; prominent nose;
thin-lipped smile

Hands: Appear aged but strong; callused; nails trimmed short

Movement: Slower than necessary; deliberate; the cultivated patience of
age

*📝 This is all ILLUSION. True form is young adult Juraian prince.
Sheldon won't know for years.*

Clothing (April 3 afternoon)

Today: Working clothes --- simple gray cotton kimono-style top, loose
gray pants (mompe)

Feet: Tabi socks with waraji sandals; practical for shrine work

Accessories: Round glasses (also illusion --- doesn't need them); no
jewelry

Context: Has been doing afternoon chores; not dressed formally

What He's Doing When Sheldon Arrives (\~4:52 PM)

Activity: Sweeping the courtyard near the main building --- canonical,
iconic image

Tool: Bamboo broom (hōki); long handle; soft bristles for gravel

Posture: Bent slightly forward, methodical sweeping strokes; meditative
rhythm

Awareness: Heard footsteps on stairs from step \~250; has been waiting

When Sheldon appears: Stops sweeping, straightens, turns to observe the
newcomer

First Words

Voice: Low, measured, unhurried; Okayama accent but softer than local
farmers

Opening line: 'You climbed all the way up.' --- statement, not question;
mild surprise

Tone: Curious but not suspicious; welcoming but reserved; assessing

Subtext: Why would anyone climb 320 steps at this hour without a clear
purpose?

What He Perceives About Sheldon

Immediately obvious: Foreign; exhausted; young (30ish); city clothes;
came by bus

Interesting: Japanese is fluent --- not tourist-level; educated speech
patterns

Concerning: Energy signature is WRONG --- Lambda resonance he shouldn't
have

Assessment: This person is not what he appears to be. Requires careful
observation.

*📝 Katsuhito is 730 years old and has seen almost everything. Sheldon
is genuinely new.*

Yosho's Inner State (Hidden from Sheldon)

Curiosity: First truly anomalous thing in decades; what IS this person?

Caution: Lambda signature suggests cosmic origin; could be threat or
opportunity

Protection instinct: Tenchi is nearby; must evaluate before allowing
closeness

Recognition: Something familiar in the energy pattern; can't place it;
Tsunami? Tokimi? Something else?

Decision: Invite in, observe, test. If dangerous, can be neutralized. If
genuine, could be valuable.

*🔮 FORESHADOW: This is the beginning of the most important relationship
of both their lives. Neither knows it yet.*
