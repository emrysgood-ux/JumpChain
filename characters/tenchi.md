Education Timeline

**7.1.1 --- Tenchi at Age 4 (First Meeting Details)**

What Sheldon sees when he first meets Tenchi on April 3, 1989:

Physical Appearance

Height: Approximately 100 cm (\~3'3") --- average for Japanese
4-year-old

Build: Small, healthy, normal child proportions; baby fat still in
cheeks

Hair: Black, straight, cut in simple bowl style by grandfather; tends to
stick up in back

Eyes: Dark brown, large, expressive; still have the roundness of early
childhood

Skin: Light tan from playing outdoors; small scrape on left knee (fell
two days ago)

Expression: Open, curious, unguarded --- the face of a child who has
been loved

Clothing (April 3 afternoon)

Today: Casual play clothes --- navy blue shorts, yellow t-shirt with
cartoon character, white socks (dirty from playing)

Shoes: Small white sneakers with velcro straps; left by the engawa
(veranda)

Note: Has changed out of kindergarten uniform (white shirt, navy shorts,
yellow hat)

Personality at This Age

Core trait: Curious and friendly --- approaches strangers without fear
(sheltered life)

Energy: Typical 4-year-old; alternates between intense activity and
sudden tiredness

Speech: Speaks clearly but with childish grammar; asks many questions;
says 'nande?' (why?) constantly

Attachment: Very close to grandfather; misses father (who works in
city); doesn't remember mother

Fears: Dark (uses nightlight); being alone; the cave grandfather told
him never to enter

Loves: Grandfather's stories; playing outside; helping with shrine
chores; anime on TV

Daily Routine (Weekdays, 1989)

Morning: Wake \~7 AM; Rea-nee prepares breakfast; kindergarten bus comes
\~8:30 AM (after Rea leaves for high school)

Kindergarten: Kamogata Municipal Kindergarten; \~9 AM - 2 PM

Afternoon: Returns by bus \~2:30 PM; plays on shrine grounds; 'helps'
grandfather; Rea-nee returns from school \~4 PM

Evening: Dinner \~6 PM (Rea cooks); bath (Rea helps); TV; bed by 8 PM
(Rea or grandfather puts him to bed)

**Primary Caretakers:**
- Katsuhito (grandfather): Daytime supervision, guidance, stories
- Rea (adopted sister): Meals, bath, bedtime routine, emotional nurturing

April 3 (today): Returned from kindergarten \~2:45 PM; has been playing
near the main building

What He's Doing When Sheldon Arrives (\~4:52 PM)

Location: Near the edge of the courtyard, playing with wooden blocks
(building a 'castle')

Activity: Stopped playing when he heard footsteps on the upper stairs;
watching the newcomer

Reaction to Sheldon: Immediate curiosity; strangers are rare; foreigners
are VERY rare

First thought: 'Who is that? He looks tired. Why is his face different?'

*📝 Tenchi has likely never seen a Black person in real life --- only on
TV, if at all. His reaction is curiosity, not fear.*

Mother's Absence

Kiyone Masaki: Died \~1986-1987 when Tenchi was \~2-3 years old (age
248, half-Juraian). He has no real memories of her

What he knows: 'Mama is in heaven' --- grandfather's gentle explanation

Photos: Has seen photos; knows her face; doesn't feel the loss as
actively as adults might expect

**Rea's Role:** Since Kiyone's death, Rea has been Tenchi's primary
female caretaker. She was ~13 when Kiyone died; she stepped into a
maternal/sister role. Tenchi calls her "Rea-nee" (big sister Rea).
Kiyone's letter acknowledges: "a girl who probably helped raise you."

Impact: Has attachment to Rea but still craves additional nurturing
presence; will attach to Sheldon quickly as another caring adult
