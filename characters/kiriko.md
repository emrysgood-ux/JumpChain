## Childhood (1989 Era)

From childhood, Kiriko was one of the few people who stayed close to Seina despite his terrible luck. She:
- Bandaged his injuries

## Galaxy Police Career (GXP Era)

### How She Joined
Kiriko's Juraian heritage (however diluted) and the GP's interest in Earth led to her recruitment. She:
- Trained at the Galaxy Police Academy
- Rose quickly due to competence
- Eventually assigned to the same unit as Seina (not coincidence — Seto's meddling)

### Her Role
- Assigned as Seina's handler/partner
- Officially to keep him alive
- Unofficially to continue the caretaking she's done since childhood
- Eventually marries him (along with several others)

---

## The Seto Factor

Seto Kamiki Jurai took interest in Kiriko because:
1. Masaki bloodline — however distant, still valuable
2. Stabilizing influence on Seina
3. Perfect for her matchmaking schemes
4. Demonstrates Earth's integration potential

Seto arranged for Kiriko's GP assignment and encouraged her relationship with Seina.

---

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon POV:**
- Kiriko's name as significant character
- Her GP future
- Her Juraian heritage awareness
- Connection to Seina as cosmic phenomenon

**What CAN Be Referenced (Phase I):**
- "Children from the village" visiting shrine
- A responsible girl who looks after the accident-prone boy
- Masaki relatives in the area (vague)

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **Phase I (1989):** Kiriko is approximately 7 years old. She may appear as one of the village children, notable only for her maturity and her habit of following Seina around to prevent disasters.

🔮 **SHELDON'S PERCEPTION:** If Sheldon notices her, he sees a responsible child caring for an unlucky friend — nothing more.

📖 **DRAMATIC IRONY:** Readers familiar with GXP know this child becomes a Galaxy Police officer and one of Seina's wives. Sheldon sees only a village girl.

📖 **PARALLEL STORIES:** As Tenchi's story unfolds in OVA canon, Kiriko's story unfolds in GXP. They occasionally intersect.

---

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Kiriko is NOT a main OVA character — she's GXP canon
- She DOES have Juraian heritage — Masaki bloodline
- Her relationship with Seina starts in CHILDHOOD, not GP recruitment
- She is NOT just Seina's caretaker — she's a capable officer in her own right
