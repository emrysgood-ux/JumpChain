**7.5 --- Kasumi Masaki (Deceased --- Yosho's First Earth Wife)**

CANON STATUS: SOFT CANON --- Referenced in True Tenchi Novels. First
Earth wife of Yosho after his exile.

⚠️ NOTE: Story Bible v9 Section 7.5 contained "Itsuki Masaki" --- this
was FABRICATED. No such character exists in canon. Replaced with Kasumi
per canon research.

**7.5.1 --- Core Identity**

**7.5.2 --- Significance**

First woman Yosho married after arriving on Earth (\~1300 years after
leaving Jurai)

Like Kiyone later, she refused life extension --- chose mortality

Died at 138 years old (extended naturally by proximity to Yosho/Funaho)

Set the precedent that Kiyone would later follow

**7.5.3 --- What Is Known**

Yosho loved her deeply

She knew something was strange about her husband but never demanded
explanation

She accepted him as he was

Her death was the first time Yosho buried someone he loved on Earth

**7.5.4 --- Story Function**

Narrative Role: Establishes pattern - Yosho has loved and lost before
Kiyone - Women in his life choose mortality over artificial extension -
Creates depth for his grief --- this is not his first loss

Phase I Relevance: Minimal --- Kasumi died nearly a century before story
start. May be mentioned in passing if Yosho reflects on loss.
