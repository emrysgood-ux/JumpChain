Nobuyuki is BOTH: 1. Yosho's descendant --- Multiple generations removed
through Yosho's Earth family line 2. Yosho's son-in-law --- Married
Kiyone, who was Yosho's daughter

Nobuyuki's ancestor AND father-in-law.

**Core Traits:**

Devoted father: Everything orbits around Tenchi. Weekend visits are the
point of his week.

Grieving widower: Three years after Kiyone's death, grief has moved from
acute to chronic. He functions but there's a hollowness.

Conflict avoider: Smooths over tensions rather than addressing them.
Uses humor to deflect.

Observer: Watches more than he speaks. Forms opinions slowly but holds
them firmly.

Work Pattern: Monday-Friday in Kurashiki; occasional site visits;
weekends at shrine

**7.3.6 --- Relationship with Kiyone (Deceased Wife)**

⚠️ CORRECTED in v10 --- Previous version had wrong marriage date and
personality

How They Met: Nobuyuki's parents died when he was young. Kiyone ---
already over 140 years old but appearing young --- tormented him for
decades with pranks.

The Courtship: "She made him the victim of many pranks, but he kept
coming back. It surprised everyone when he grew up and asked her to
marry him. Villagers seriously questioned if something was wrong with
his head." (OVA Canon)

Marriage: Early 20th century (\~1900s-1910) at Masaki Shrine; Katsuhito
officiated

Marriage Dynamic: The woman who tormented him for decades became, by
village standards, "almost reasonable." He learned her humor. Her jokes
are now his jokes.

Her Death: \~1986-1987; natural aging at age 248 (she chose mortality
--- no body enhancements, no Royal Tree). She did not tell him how
little time she had left.

Death Script: Co-written by Kiyone and her mother Airi --- fake stories
about her death for Tenchi. Nobuyuki must perform these stories. It's
her final prank.

His Grief: - Doesn't talk about Kiyone - Keeps her photo in wallet -
Can't look at wedding photo - Hides grief behind comedy --- perverted
jokes are armor - Only Yosho sees through his mask \### 7.3.7 ---
Relationship with Katsuhito/Yosho

Surface Dynamic: Respectful son to honored father

Deeper Truth: Knows Katsuhito is more than he appears. Doesn't ask. The
not-asking is deliberate.

Trust: Absolute. If Katsuhito says Sheldon is trustworthy, Nobuyuki
accepts that.

**7.3.8 --- Relationship with Tenchi**

Core Dynamic: Devoted father, limited time --- quality over quantity

Weekend Rituals: - Arrives Friday evening - Saturdays: Takes Tenchi on
outings - Sundays: Helps with shrine; leaves late afternoon

discipline

Assessment Process: Watches Sheldon with Tenchi; notes father's respect;
observes work ethic

doesn't push
