## Origin: The Geminar Connection

### What Is Geminar?
Geminar is an alternate dimension connected to the Tenchi Muyo multiverse. It features:
- Medieval-esque technology mixed with bio-mechanical constructs (Seikijin)
- Isolated from main universe
- Rare crossings between dimensions

### Rea's True Nature (CANON)
**CONFIRMED (OVA 4, Tenchi Ban 13.8):** Rea was one of three preteen-aged **artificial humans** created on Geminar to pilot Seikijin (bio-mechanical battle units) against the threat called Gaia.

**The Plan:**
- Three artificial pilots created with enhanced abilities
- They were having difficulties with their mission
- Plan: Send one to another world to have a child with combined pilot talents
- Originally Neizai was chosen to be sent

**The Accident:**
- Rea was fascinated with "the other world" (Earth)
- During equipment testing, the dimensional transfer accidentally triggered
- Rea was caught in it and transported to Earth
- She arrived as a preteen in a field near Okayama, ~1984

### How She Was Found
Kiyone Masaki discovered the disoriented preteen girl in a field. Kiyone:
- Recognized something unusual about her
- Chose NOT to investigate deeply (perhaps sensing the truth would be too strange)
- Took her in as an adopted younger sister
- Gave her a home and family

*📝 Rea's arrival was accidental, not deliberate placement — but suspiciously convenient.*

## Personality

**Core Traits:**
- Quiet, observant
- Practical and competent
- Emotionally reserved
- Deeply loyal to family
- Awareness of being "different" without fully understanding why

**Speech Patterns:**
- Soft-spoken
- Direct when necessary
- Rarely complains
- Shows affection through actions, not words

---

## Role in the Household (1989)

After Kiyone's death (~1987), Rea stepped into a caretaking role:
- Learned cooking from Kiyone, now prepares most meals
- Manages household cleaning and organization
- Looks after young Tenchi (age 4-5)
- Functions as Tenchi's older sister and partial mother figure

**CANON:** "Rea would end up cooking and cleaning house for the Masaki, even though she was a high school student at the time." — Tenchi Muyo Wiki

### Daily Schedule (School Days, 1989)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5:30 AM | Wake; prepare breakfast |
| 6:30 AM | Breakfast with household |
| 7:00 AM | Prepare Tenchi for kindergarten |
| 7:30 AM | Leave for school (walks or takes bus) |
| 8:00 AM - 3:30 PM | School (Kamogata area high school) |
| 4:00 PM | Return home |
| 4:30 PM | Begin dinner preparations |
| 6:00 PM | Dinner |
| 7:00 PM | Homework; help Tenchi with bath |
| 8:00 PM | Tenchi to bed |
| 9:00 PM | Finish homework; household tasks |
| 10:00 PM | Sleep |

*📝 April 3, 1989 (Day 1): Japanese school year typically starts April 6-8. Rea may have entrance ceremony, orientation, or preparation activities keeping her at school late.*

### The Responsibility
At 15-17 years old, Rea carries significant household burden while also being a full-time student:
- Not forced, but self-imposed out of love and duty
- Filling the void left by Kiyone's death
- Nobuyuki is often away working; Yosho is elderly in appearance
- She finds purpose and belonging in being needed
- Balances school obligations with household management

*📝 Rea's competence may stem from her artificial human design — created for responsibility.*

## What She Knows

**Rea is aware:**
- She was found, not born to this family
- Kiyone never lied to her about this
- Her origins are mysterious
- She's "different" somehow (can't articulate how)

**Rea does NOT know:**
- She's an artificial human
- She's from another dimension called Geminar
- Why she was found in that field
- Her true purpose (Seikijin pilot)
- Others like her exist on Geminar

---

## Relationship with Tenchi

Rea has raised Tenchi since Kiyone's death:
- She was ~13 when Kiyone died; Tenchi was 2-3
- She stepped into a maternal/sister role
- He depends on her for daily care
- She carries memories of Kiyone that Tenchi doesn't have

### The Caretaker Dynamic
Rea functions as Tenchi's primary caretaker:
- Prepares his meals
- Gets him ready for school
- Bandages his scrapes
- Provides emotional stability
- Occupies the "responsible one" role

*📝 Kiyone's letter acknowledges this: "a girl who probably helped raise you."*

---

## Future Canon Events

**CANON (OVA 3+):**
- Rea eventually marries Nobuyuki Masaki (Tenchi's father)
- Together they have a son: Kenshi Masaki
- Kenshi is sent to Geminar at age 15 (War on Geminar series)
- This creates a full-circle connection: Rea from Geminar → Earth → her son returns to Geminar

---

## Phase I Integration

---

## Story Integration Notes

### Day 1 Introduction (April 3, 1989)

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Rea is NOT present when Sheldon arrives (~4:52 PM) because she is at school.

**Why She's Absent:**
- Japanese school year starts in early April (typically April 6-8)
- April 3 may have entrance ceremonies, orientation, or prep activities
- High school students often have extended hours at semester start
- She returns home ~5:30-6:00 PM

**First Meeting Scene (NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN):**
- Rea returns home to find a stranger in the household
- Katsuhito introduces Sheldon
- Her reaction: Guarded, assessing, protective of Tenchi
- She has been the household manager; who is this person disrupting that?

📖 **Phase I (1989):** Rea is present from Day 1 evening onward. Sheldon encounters her as the household's quiet manager — a teenage girl who cooks, cleans, and watches over young Tenchi while attending high school.

🔮 **SHELDON'S DYNAMIC:** Sheldon, himself placed by cosmic forces, may sense kinship with another "found" person. Their parallel situations create thematic resonance. However, there may also be tension: Rea has been THE caretaker, and Sheldon's arrival disrupts her established role.

📖 **COOPERATION OR CONFLICT:** Rea and Sheldon must negotiate household responsibilities. Does she welcome the help? Resent the intrusion? Both? Initially wary, she may warm as she sees Sheldon is genuinely helpful and good with Tenchi.

📖 **DRAMATIC IRONY:** Readers who know canon understand Rea will eventually marry Nobuyuki. Sheldon sees only a teenage girl helping with the household.

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Rea is NOT a young child — she's a teenager in 1989
- She was NOT found as an infant — she arrived as a preteen
- She is NOT naturally born — she's an artificial human
- Her competence is NOT magical — she was literally designed for responsibility
- She is NOT blood-related to the Masaki family (until she marries Nobuyuki)

**Connection to War on Geminar:**
The "Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar" spin-off centers on her son Kenshi going to Geminar. Rea's accidental journey to Earth eventually results in Kenshi being sent to her homeworld — closing the dimensional loop.
