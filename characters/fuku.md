## Origins

### Creation Purpose
Fuku was created by Washu Hakubi at Tenchi's request specifically to protect his unlucky friend Seina Yamada. Given Seina's catastrophic bad luck, he needed extraordinary protection.

### Core Composition
A dark secret lies at Fuku's heart:

- All memories of this past life were erased
- Fuku has no awareness of this origin
- She developed as a purely innocent being

### Relationship to Ryo-Ohki
Fuku is the younger sister of Ryo-Ohki:
- Both created by Washu
- Both are cabbit artificial lifeforms
- Fuku was designed to be compatible with her sister
- Teaching relationship in some interactions

Unlike some of Washu's creations:
