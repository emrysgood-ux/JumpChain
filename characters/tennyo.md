## Birth and Early Life (~1910-1980s)

Tennyo was born approximately 1910 to Kiyone Masaki and Nobuyuki Masaki at the Masaki Shrine. As the daughter of a quarter-Juraian mother and a nominally human father (Nobuyuki is actually descended from Juraian colonists), Tennyo inherited enough Juraian heritage to dramatically slow her aging.

### The Problem of Unchanging Youth

By the 1960s-1970s, Tennyo's unchanged appearance became untenable:
- Villagers who remembered her as a young woman still saw her as a young woman
- Her father Nobuyuki had visibly aged while she hadn't
- Rumors and questions became unavoidable

**Resolution:** Tennyo left Earth, establishing residence at the Galaxy Academy where her grandmother Airi serves as Chairwoman. Her departure was staged as "going abroad for work" — technically true.

---

## Personality

**Core Traits:**
- Inherited mother's mischievous streak (though mellower)
- Practical and efficient
- Protective of family from a distance
- Dry humor
- Comfortable in both Earth and galactic cultures

**Speech Patterns:**
- Formal in professional settings
- Relaxed with family
- Occasional Earth idioms that confuse galactic acquaintances

## Family Connections

| Relation | Person | Notes |

## Current Status (1989)

Tennyo serves as an administrator at the Galaxy Academy, working alongside her grandmother Airi. She:
- Maintains awareness of Tenchi's development through family reports
- Cannot return to Earth due to appearance issues
- Grieves her mother privately — she outlived Kiyone despite being her daughter
- Represents the family's connection to galactic civilization

---

## The Burden of Outliving

Tennyo faces the same tragedy as her grandfather Yosho: watching mortal-seeming family members age and die while she remains young. She:
- Watched her mother age and die at 248 (young by Juraian standards but still aging)
- Will likely watch her father Nobuyuki die of old age
- Knows Tenchi may face the same aging issues unless he bonds with a Royal Tree

*📝 This burden creates quiet melancholy beneath her practical exterior.*

---

## Relationship with Tenchi

Tennyo has never been able to have a normal sibling relationship with Tenchi:
- She left Earth when he was an infant
- They have met, but infrequently
- She knows far more about him than he knows about her
- She's protective from a distance — monitoring reports, ensuring his safety
- Tenchi likely thinks of her as "the sister who went abroad" rather than a cosmic being

**Future Integration:** After canon events begin (Year 13+), Tennyo may be able to visit more openly as Tenchi learns the truth about his heritage.

---

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon POV:**
- The name "Tennyo"
- Any reference to Tenchi having an older sister
- Any reference to Galaxy Academy
- Any hint that a family member left Earth for space

**What CAN Be Referenced (Phase I):**
- Old photographs that might show an unnamed young woman
- Vague references to "relatives abroad"
- Nobuyuki's occasional distant look (missing his daughter)

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **Phase I:** Tennyo exists only as dramatic irony — the sister Tenchi doesn't know, the daughter watching from the stars.

🔮 **Year 13+:** Tennyo's introduction creates complex family dynamics. Sheldon will meet a woman who looks exactly like Kiyone but isn't.

📖 **RELATIONSHIP TO SHELDON:** Tennyo has been receiving reports about the "strange young man" who appeared at the shrine in 1989. Through Airi and Minaho's intelligence, she knows more about Sheldon than he knows about her. Her first meeting with him will be informed by 12+ years of observation data.

---

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Tennyo is NOT a minor character — she's Tenchi's full biological sister
- She is NOT young — she's 79+ years old despite appearing 20s
- She has NOT abandoned her family — she's protecting them by staying away
- She DOES have Juraian heritage — enough to slow her aging significantly
