Along with her sisters, Tokimi sought to prove the existence of a being greater than the Choushin themselves. Her methods were the most aggressive:

- Created anomalies to stress-test reality
- Manipulated powerful beings to find or create a superior entity

### Discovery of Kami Tenchi
After Tenchi defeated Z and demonstrated power beyond the Choushin, their quest was answered. Unlike her sisters, Tokimi was slower to accept Tenchi as a person rather than merely as their answer.
