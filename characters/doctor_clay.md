## Story Significance

## Character Notes for Story Use

### In 1989 Timeline
- Clay is out in the galaxy, serving Tokimi
- Has no awareness of Earth or Tenchi yet
- Still active in criminal underworld
- Will become relevant during OVA 2 events (mid-1990s)

### Thematic Elements
- Contrast with Washu's relationship to her "children" (Ryoko, Ryo-Ohki)
- Shows what happens when genius is corrupted by resentment
- Zero's development parallels questions of AI/created beings' rights
