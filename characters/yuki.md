## NAME MEANING

雪 (Yuki) means "snow" — unusual for a child born in rural Okayama. Her grandmother Hana chose the name because Yuki was born during the first snowfall the village had seen in years. "A sign," Hana said. "Something rare and beautiful."

## LIFE HISTORY

### Childhood (1940-1958)
- Mother died giving birth to her; raised by father Takeo and grandmother Hana
- Grew up knowing she was the reason her mother was gone
- Grandmother Hana filled the maternal role with warmth and stories
- Had a half-brother Kiyoshi (5 years older), but he left for Osaka when she was 15
- Never quite fit the village mold: too curious, too questioning, too restless
- Dreamed of cities, of elsewhere, of something beyond rice paddies

### The American (1957-1958)
- Age 17: Met James Carter at a restaurant near the American base
- He was charming, different, offered escape
- Her father disapproved; she didn't care
- Pregnant by early 1958
- Left Japan for California, married James in a courthouse

### California Years (1958-1970)
- **March 15, 1959:** Sheldon born in Oakland, California
- Struggled with English, isolation, a husband who was often absent or drunk
- Worked factory jobs, cleaning jobs, whatever paid
- Taught Sheldon Japanese from infancy — her one non-negotiable
- Marriage deteriorated; James drank more, worked less
- Divorced 1970; kept Carter surname for Sheldon's sake

### Single Mother (1970-1980)
- Raised Sheldon alone in California
- Worked multiple jobs: factory during day, cleaning at night
- Fierce about his education; pushed him relentlessly
- "You are twice as smart as anyone in this country. Act like it."
- Kept Japanese traditions: New Year's mochi, Obon observances, proper chopstick use
- Health began failing late 1970s; ignored it

### Return to Japan (1980-1985)
- Returned to Japan in 1980 after diagnosis (early-stage cancer)
- Sheldon was 21, in graduate school; she didn't want to burden him
- Stayed with brother Kiyoshi in Osaka
- Reconciliation of sorts with family; never saw father (died 1978)
- Cancer recurred, metastasized
- Died August 15, 1985 — the anniversary of the war's end
- Final words to Kiyoshi: "Tell him to come home. Tell him where he belongs."

## RELATIONSHIPS

### With Takeo (Father)
- Complicated: loved him, resented him, defied him
- Saw him as representing everything she wanted to escape
- Only understood his love after it was too late
- His death in 1978 left her with permanent, unresolved guilt

### With Hana (Grandmother)
- The warmest relationship of her childhood
- Hana told her stories, taught her songs, gave her the shamisen
- When Hana died (1979), Yuki lost her last link to maternal affection
- Kept Hana's teachings alive through Sheldon

### With Kiyoshi (Half-Brother)
- Distant in childhood (5-year gap, he left when she was 15)
- Reconnected when she returned to Japan in 1980
- He took her in without question; they became genuinely close
- He was with her when she died

### With James Carter (Husband)
- Passion that cooled into disappointment
- He was her ticket out; she was his exotic adventure
- Neither got what they expected
- After divorce: occasional contact, then nothing
- She heard he died in 1982; felt only numbness

### With Sheldon (Son)
- Her great love, her great project, her everything
- Pushed him hard because she believed in him
- Not demonstrative; love expressed through sacrifice, expectations
- Spoke Japanese with him always; told him about Japan
- Taught him: "You are Tsukino. Never forget that."
- Last saw him 1980 (he visited during her return to Japan)
- They exchanged letters; she never told him how sick she was

## WHAT SHE TOLD SHELDON

Growing up, Yuki planted seeds of heritage in her American son:

> "Your grandfather farms land his family has worked for generations. Someday you should see it."

> "In Japan, we don't just throw away the old things. We repair them. We make them stronger."

> "Your grandmother — my mother — died so I could live. I owe her everything. You owe her too."

> "The Tsukino name means something. You carry it even if you carry Carter on paper."

> "When you're lost, go to where your ancestors are. They'll show you the way."

---

## WHAT SHELDON REMEMBERS (Real Memories)

In his actual past life, Sheldon had Dorothy Mae as grandmother. But in Cosmos's created history, "Sheldon's memories" of Yuki include:

- Her hands making onigiri, pressing rice into triangles
- Her voice reading Japanese picture books at bedtime
- Her sharp disappointment when he brought home anything less than excellence
- The way she cried silently, thinking he couldn't hear
- Her rare laugh — surprised out of her, genuine
- The smell of the factory on her clothes when she came home late
- How small she looked at the airport when he left for MIT (in created history, Harvard)
- Her letters, always asking if he was eating properly

---

## COSMOS'S DESIGN NOTE

**Why Yuki is Significant:**

Cosmos designed Yuki as a bridge — not just between Japan and America, but between Sheldon's old life and new one.

- Like Dorothy Mae, Yuki is fierce, practical, and loving in ways that aren't soft
- Like Dorothy Mae, she pushed her grandson/son to excel
- Like Dorothy Mae, she died too soon
- Unlike Dorothy Mae, Yuki left Sheldon a homeland to return to

Yuki's face may echo Ikuko Tsukino (Usagi's mother). Cosmos creating a mother for Sheldon by drawing, perhaps unconsciously, on her own mortal family.

## THE LETTERS

Yuki wrote to her father (rarely answered), to her brother Kiyoshi (frequently), and later to her son. Kiyoshi keeps all of them in a box:

**Sample excerpts (from letters to Kiyoshi):**

> "The boy is speaking in full sentences now. He says 'okaasan' before 'mommy.' I'm winning." (1962)

> "James is drinking again. The boy doesn't know. I make sure he doesn't know." (1968)

> "He got into MIT. Full scholarship. I cried for an hour. Then I made him practice his kanji." (1977)

> "I'm coming home. The doctors say... I'm coming home, brother. I hope there's room." (1980)

> "Tell Father I'm sorry. Tell him I understand now. Tell him—" (Letter found unfinished, 1980, after Takeo's death was confirmed)

---

## NARRATIVE FUNCTION

Yuki is the ghost in Sheldon's new life — a mother he "remembers" but never knew. When he visits Kiyoshi, when he reads her letters, when he stands at the family house, he'll be haunted by a woman who loved him fiercely and died too young.

The parallel to Dorothy Mae is deliberate. Sheldon knows what it is to be raised by a strong woman who died and left him unmoored. Cosmos gave him that again — the shape of the grief, the weight of expectation, the absence that never heals.
