# SHELDON'S TENCHI MUYO OVA HISTORY
## Canonical Timeline and Family History
## Last Updated: January 2026

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Cosmos rewrote causality when placing Sheldon in the Tenchi Muyo OVA universe. This is not fabrication, forgery, or deception. **The history is real.** The Tsukino family genuinely lived and died. Sheldon is genuinely their descendant. Uncle Kiyoshi has genuine memories of meeting him. The documents are not forged — they document real events.

The only difference from ordinary history: Sheldon's conscious experience begins April 3, 1989. He has no personal memory of events before that date, though those events genuinely occurred.

## PART 1: THE TSUKINO FAMILY (GENUINE HISTORY)

### The Family Line

The Tsukino family has roots in Okayama Prefecture going back generations. They were farmers, then shopkeepers, then scattered by urbanization.

| Generation | Key Figure | Dates | Role |
|------------|-----------|-------|------|
| Great-Great | Tsukino Jirō | 1850-1921 | Patriarch. Built original house. |
| Great | Tsukino Hana | 1908-1979 | Matriarch. Raised children alone after war. |
| Grandparent | Tsukino Takeo | 1925-1978 | Sheldon's maternal grandfather. Died of heart attack. |
| Parent | Tsukino Yuki | 1930-1985 | Sheldon's mother. Emigrated to America. Died of cancer. |
| Parent | James Carter | 1932-1970 | Sheldon's father. Black American from Georgia. Divorced Yuki; died in accident. |
| Sibling | Tsukino Kiyoshi | 1922-present | Mother's brother. Living in Osaka. Sheldon's uncle. |
| Sibling | Tsukino Michiko | 1928-1986 | Mother's sister. Never married. Left property to Sheldon. |
| Self | Tsukino Sheldon | 1959-present | Son of Yuki and James. Returned to Japan 1987. |

### Sheldon's Mother: Yuki Tsukino

Yuki was born in 1930 in Kamogata village, Okayama Prefecture. Her father Takeo was a farmer; her mother died when Yuki was young. She was raised by her father and grandmother Hana.

In 1957, at age 27, Yuki met James Carter, a Black American serviceman stationed at Iwakuni Air Base. Their relationship was scandalous for the time — a Japanese woman and a Black American man — but Yuki was independent-minded. They married in 1958 and emigrated to California.

Sheldon was born March 15, 1959, in Oakland, California.

The marriage was difficult. Cultural differences, economic hardship, and James's struggles led to divorce in 1970. James died shortly after (car accident). Yuki raised Sheldon alone, working factory jobs. She taught him Japanese, told him about his heritage, maintained correspondence with her siblings in Japan.

Yuki died of cancer in September 1985, when Sheldon was 26.

### Sheldon's Father: James Carter

James Edward Carter was born in 1932 in Griffin, Georgia — the same state where Sheldon (in his pre-death life) would be born decades later. Cosmos wove this connection deliberately.

James joined the US Air Force in 1955 and was stationed at Iwakuni Air Base in Japan from 1957-1958. He met Yuki at a restaurant near the base. Their romance was genuine, if ultimately unsustainable.

After returning to California with Yuki, James worked as a mechanic. The marriage deteriorated. He drank. They divorced in 1970. James died the same year in a car accident. Sheldon was ten.

### Aunt Michiko: The Property Connection

Tsukino Michiko never married. She stayed in Okayama her entire life, maintaining the family property while her siblings scattered. When their mother Hana died in 1979, Michiko was alone.

Michiko maintained correspondence with her sister Yuki in America. She knew about Sheldon — her nephew, her sister's son. When Yuki died in 1985, Michiko reached out to Sheldon, offering family connection.

In late 1986, Michiko was diagnosed with terminal illness. She wrote letters — to her brother Kiyoshi, to her nephew Sheldon, to the village — introducing Sheldon and asking that he be welcomed when he came to claim his inheritance.

Michiko died in December 1986. Sheldon arrived in Japan for her funeral in early 1987.

## PART 2: SHELDON'S DOCUMENTED HISTORY IN JAPAN (1987-1989)

### The Arrival (1987)

Sheldon arrived in Japan in April 1987 to attend Aunt Michiko's funeral and settle her estate. He was 28 years old (by the timeline's reckoning), newly arrived from America, grieving his mother's death two years prior.

He stayed initially with Uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka. Kiyoshi was elderly (65) but welcoming. He showed Sheldon photographs of his mother as a young woman, told him family stories, welcomed him as blood.

### The Wandering Years (1987-1988)

After settling initial estate matters, Sheldon spent nearly two years traveling Japan. He was processing grief — his mother's death, Aunt Michiko's death, the loss of his entire family. He worked odd jobs. He visited temples. He wrote occasional letters to Uncle Kiyoshi.

The letters exist. They're in Kiyoshi's possession:

| Date | Content |
|------|---------|
| May 1987 | "Thank you for your hospitality. I am traveling to see Japan. I will write again." |
| August 1987 | "I am in Kyoto. Studying. Thinking about what to do with my life." |
| January 1988 | "I spent New Year alone. Thinking of mother. Thank you for the omamori you sent." |
| June 1988 | "I have been working odd jobs. I am considering returning to Kamogata to see the family land." |
| December 1988 | "Happy New Year. I may come to the village in spring." |

### The Final Months (Early 1989)

In the first months of 1989, Sheldon's documented activities become sparse. He was in the Okayama area, apparently deciding what to do with the inherited property.

Then, on April 3, 1989, Sheldon's conscious experience begins.

## PART 3: THE MEMORY GAP

### What Sheldon Experiences

Sheldon has no personal memory of anything before April 3, 1989. His last clear memory is dying in 2025 Alaska. His next clear memory is waking in a field in 1989 Okayama.

The two years of documented history (1987-1989) genuinely happened. People remember meeting him. Letters exist in his handwriting. Bank transactions are recorded. He attended Michiko's funeral. He stayed with Kiyoshi. He traveled Japan.

But Sheldon cannot recall any of it.

### How This Functions

This is similar to amnesia. The events are real; Sheldon's access to those memories is blocked. If asked about those years, he can truthfully say:

- "I was traveling. Processing my mother's death."
- "Those months are blurry. Grief does that."
- "I don't remember the details clearly."

All of these are true. He was traveling (documented). He was grieving (documented). He doesn't remember details (because he can't access those memories).

### What This Is NOT

This is NOT a cover story. Sheldon is not lying. The history genuinely happened. His inability to recall specific details is itself genuine — it's a real gap in his personal memory, not a fabrication he must maintain.

## PART 4: CONNECTION TO MASAKI SHRINE

### The Geographic Proximity

The Tsukino family property in Kamogata is approximately 15 minutes' walk from Masaki Shrine. The village and the shrine are part of the same community. The families would have known each other for generations.

### The Natural Discovery

When Sheldon's conscious experience begins on April 3, 1989, he finds himself in a field near the village. Following the path uphill, he discovers the 320 stone steps leading to Masaki Shrine.

This is not coincidence. Cosmos placed him where he would naturally find the shrine — the place where he would spend the next thousand years.

### Why the Shrine Takes Him In

Katsuhito (Yosho) runs Masaki Shrine. He is an elderly priest (in appearance) who lives with his 4-year-old grandson Tenchi. Tenchi's mother Kiyone died in 1987. Tenchi's father Nobuyuki works in the city and visits weekends.

The shrine needs help. Yosho is "elderly." A small child requires care. The grounds require maintenance.

When a young man appears — polite, capable, with legitimate family connections to the village — and offers to work in exchange for shelter, it's a practical arrangement.

### The Tsukino Property

Sheldon inherited his aunt Michiko's property: a small traditional house, some land, and the site of the old family shop. This property serves as his workshop and storage. He lives at the shrine but maintains the family property.

This dual arrangement is normal in rural Japan. The shrine is his home. The Tsukino house is his work space.

---

## PART 5: PLOT HOLES RESOLVED

### "Why is he there?"

Sheldon inherited property in the village. He came to settle his aunt's estate. The shrine is nearby. He offered to help. He stayed.

### "How does he explain being American?"

His mother Yuki emigrated to America in 1958. Sheldon was born there. He returned to Japan to claim his inheritance and connect with his heritage. This is a completely normal immigration pattern.

### "How does he explain being Black?"

His father James Carter was a Black American serviceman. Mixed-heritage Japanese-American individuals are not common in rural 1989 Japan, but they exist. Villagers may be curious, but the Tsukino family connection is documented.

### "What about his education?"

Sheldon has four PhDs (Physics, Applied Mathematics, Materials Science, Experimental Physics). This is his pre-death education, carried forward into his new life. He presents as an academic on sabbatical — entirely plausible given his credentials.

### "Why doesn't he remember the previous two years?"

Grief-related dissociation. Memory gaps after major loss. This is medically recognized. If anyone asks, Sheldon can honestly say those months are blurry.

### "What if someone asks specific questions about 1987-1988?"

Sheldon's documented history is consistent with who he actually is — same personality, same mannerisms, same handwriting. Uncle Kiyoshi remembers meeting him; that meeting was real. If discrepancies arise, they're chalked up to memory differences, which are normal.

### "What if he contradicts himself?"

He might. Humans contradict themselves all the time when recalling events from years ago. Any minor inconsistency reads as normal human memory variation, not as evidence of deception.

## PART 6: RELATIONSHIP TO COSMOS'S ACTION

### What Cosmos Did

Cosmos rewrote causality so that Sheldon Tsukino genuinely existed — born in 1959 to Yuki Tsukino and James Carter, raised in America, educated to doctoral level, returned to Japan in 1987.

This is not document forgery. This is reality creation. Within the timeline, these events actually happened.

### What Cosmos Gave Sheldon

- A genuine family history
- Living relatives (Uncle Kiyoshi's family)
- Inherited property with legitimate claim
- Documentation that reflects real events
- A plausible explanation for his presence

### What Cosmos Did NOT Give Sheldon

- Personal memories of the 1987-1989 period
- A fake identity to maintain
- A lie to tell
- Anything that requires deception

### Why This Matters

Sheldon does not need to "maintain a cover story" because there is no cover story. Everything about his identity is true. The only gap is his personal memory — and that gap is itself genuine.

---

## PART 7: IMPLICATIONS FOR STORY

### Sheldon's Internal Experience

Sheldon knows his documented history exists. He has the wallet, the ID, the koseki excerpt, the letter from Uncle Kiyoshi. He knows these reflect real events he cannot remember.

This creates a strange dual existence: he is Tsukino Sheldon (documented, true) and he is also the reincarnated soul placed here by Cosmos (experienced, true). Both are real.

### How He Relates to Family

Uncle Kiyoshi is genuinely his uncle. The cousins are genuinely his cousins. When Kiyoshi weeps at Sheldon's wedding and says his mother would be proud, that's a genuine emotional connection.

Sheldon doesn't have to pretend to care about these people. They ARE his family. Cosmos made it so.

### How He Relates to the Village

Sheldon is genuinely a Tsukino. When villagers remember his grandfather Takeo or great-grandmother Hana, they're remembering his actual ancestors. When they say "you look like your mother," they're seeing a genuine resemblance Cosmos built into his appearance.

### How He Relates to the Shrine

Sheldon became part of Masaki Shrine through natural circumstance: proximity, need, willingness to help. Yosho took him in because he was useful and trustworthy. Tenchi attached to him because he was present and caring.

None of this required deception. Sheldon is who he appears to be: a capable man with legitimate local connections who showed up when the shrine needed help.
