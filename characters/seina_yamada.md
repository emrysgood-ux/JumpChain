## The Worst Luck in the Universe

### Nature of His Luck
Seina Yamada possesses "the worst luck in the universe," described in novels as a "biased probability." This isn't simple bad luck—it's a cosmic-scale phenomenon:

- Injuries are a daily occurrence
- His mere presence causes chaos

### The Paradox
Rather than being purely detrimental, his extraordinary misfortune has an unexpected benefit:
- Space pirates are inexplicably drawn to him
- His bad luck functions like a pirate magnet
- The Galaxy Police strategically exploits this for operations
- He becomes their most effective pirate trap
