## Overview

The Chousin (超神) are three hyper-dimensional goddesses who created the known universe as an experiment. They exist beyond normal spacetime and are effectively omnipotent within their creation.

## The Three Sisters

| Name | Domain | Current Status (Year 13) |
|------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Washu** | Science/Matter | Physical form on Earth |
| **Tsunami** | Life/Spirit | Assimilated with Sasami |
| **Tokimi** | Space/Dimension | Observing from outside |

---

## The Experiment

### Purpose
The Chousin created the universe to find a being capable of transcending dimensional limitations — something they themselves cannot do.

### Method
- Created physical universe with set laws
- Seeded life to evolve naturally
- Watched for emergence of transcendent being
- Jurai and Light Hawk Wings are part of this experiment

### The Candidate
Tenchi Masaki is identified as the being they sought — capable of generating more Light Hawk Wings than any Juraian, suggesting he may transcend their experiment.

## WASHU (鷲羽)

### Identity
- Original Chousin, sealed her memories to live as mortal
- Became "greatest scientific genius in the universe"
- Created Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki
- Created Kagato (indirectly, through Naja Akara grief)

### Lost Memory
Washu sealed her Chousin memories to experience existence from below. She can access them when needed but prefers her mortal perspective.

### Current Role
- Scientific analysis of anomalies
- Protection of Masaki household
- Investigation of Sheldon's Lambda existence

---

## TSUNAMI (津名魅)

### Identity
- Chousin of Life and Spirit
- Bonded with the Royal Trees of Jurai
- Assimilated with Sasami to save her life

### Sasami Assimilation
When young Sasami was mortally injured (~300 years ago), Tsunami merged with her. Eventually, Sasami will fully become Tsunami.

### Current Role
- Lives within Sasami
- Connects to all Juraian trees
- Observes Sheldon through household presence

---

## TOKIMI (訪希深)

### Identity
- Chousin of Space and Dimension
- Remains in higher dimensions
- Most detached from physical creation

### Observation Role
Tokimi watches the experiment from outside, intervening only when necessary. She is the most likely to notice if Cosmos (another cosmic entity) takes interest in their creation.

### Z Connection
Created the being "Z" as an agent, though this proved problematic.

## Chousin Capabilities

### What They Can Do
- Create/destroy matter and energy
- Manipulate spacetime
- Observe all points simultaneously
- Communicate across dimensions
- Create life (with varying success)

### What They Cannot Do
- Transcend their own dimensional limitations
- Create beings that surpass them (yet)
- Perceive certain other cosmologies
- Understand Lambda power (external to their creation)

---

## Sheldon Anomaly

### What Confuses the Chousin

1. **External Origin:** Sheldon's Lambda power didn't come from their creation
2. **Quality Match:** The craftsmanship rivals their own work
3. **Unknown Creator:** They cannot identify Cosmos
4. **Purpose Clarity:** Unlike their experiments, Sheldon's purpose (caretaking) is obvious

### Their Response
- Classify as "Protected Anomaly"
- Observe without interference
- Document for future reference
- Prepare for possible contact with creator

---

## Story Integration

### Phase I
Chousin are completely unknown to Sheldon. They cannot appear or be referenced.

### Phase III+
- Washu discusses them openly
- Sheldon learns he's in a created universe
- The Chousin's interest in him becomes subplot
- Potential Cosmos/Chousin contact in far future
