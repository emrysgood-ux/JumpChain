In our story's timeframe:
- Active Emperor of Jurai
- Does NOT know about Tenchi
- Knows Yosho is on Earth but respects his exile
- Has not directly interfered with Earth

### 4.2 — Story Integration

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon's POV (Phase I):**
- Azusa
- Emperor of Jurai
- Juraian politics
- Any galactic governance references

**When Azusa Becomes Relevant:**
- Only after Ayeka arrives (Year 13+)
- His representatives may visit
- Succession crisis becomes subplot

### 4.3 — Potential Future Interactions

| Scenario | Likelihood | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Official visit to Earth | Medium | After Year 13 events |
| Meeting Sheldon | Low | Would notice Lambda anomaly |
| Political involvement | High | Tenchi's status matters |

The novel covers:
- Azusa's rise to power
- His marriage to Funaho
- Political struggles
- Early years of his reign

### 5.2 — Common Errors to Avoid

| Error | Correct Information |
|-------|-------------------|
| Azusa is cruel | He's STERN but not cruel |
| Azusa controls everything | SETO has more practical power |
| Azusa hates Yosho | He's FRUSTRATED, not hateful |
| Azusa is weak | He's a capable leader and warrior |
