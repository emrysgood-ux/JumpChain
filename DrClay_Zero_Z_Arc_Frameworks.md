# PART 1: DR. CLAY / ZERO ARC

## Year 14-15 (2002-2003): The Clone

---

## SECTION 1.1: CANON BASELINE

**Episodes 10-12: "I Love Tenchi" / "Advent of Goddess" / "Zero Ryoko"**

1. **Setup:** Tokimi orders Dr. Clay to capture Washu
2. **Method:** Clay sends Zero to infiltrate household
3. **Infiltration:** Zero captures Ryoko, takes her form
4. **Copy:** Zero copies Ryoko's appearance, memories, AND emotions
5. **Complication:** Zero falls in love with Tenchi (copied emotions)
6. **Discovery:** Washu detects Zero via Clay's logo during bath
7. **Confrontation:** Zero defies Clay, protects Tenchi
8. **Resolution:** Zero and Ryoko merge (Washu's solution)
9. **Aftermath:** Ryoko more honest about feelings

**Key Canon Details:**
- Zero couldn't duplicate Ryoko's gems (Tokimi's power had limits)
- Washu detected Zero through PHYSICAL evidence, not sensing
- Zero's emotional awakening was genuine
- Tokimi and D3 observed, took interest in Tenchi
- Clay and Zero's memories of Tokimi were blocked by D3

---

## SECTION 1.2: WHAT CHANGES

| Element | Canon | Our Story | Reason |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Zero's infiltration** | Perfect copy | Same | Tokimi's power unchanged |
| **Emotional copy** | Gains Ryoko's feelings | Gains OUR Ryoko's feelings | Ryoko's state different |
| **Detection method** | Bath scene, Clay's logo | Same | Too good to change |
| **Sheldon's suspicion** | N/A | May notice behavioral differences | His observational role |
| **Resolution** | Merge | Same | Canon preserved |

---

## SECTION 1.3: LOCKED DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Zero Copies "Our" Ryoko

**Rationale:**
- Ryoko has been in "aunt" household for 1-2 years
- Less combative, more integrated
- Zero copies THIS emotional state
- Results in calmer Zero

**Impact:**
- Zero is less aggressive than canon
- Still falls for Tenchi (that feeling unchanged)
- Infiltration might be MORE successful initially
- Subtler differences to detect

**LOCKED:** Zero copies integrated Ryoko, not chaotic canon Ryoko.

---

### Decision 2: Sheldon Notices Something "Off"

**Rationale:**
- Sheldon cooks for household daily
- Knows everyone's food preferences
- Behavioral baseline established
- Zero might act slightly different at meals

**What He Notices:**
- Subtle food preference changes (Zero doesn't have 12 years of meal history)
- Slight behavioral variations
- BUT no proof — just "something feels wrong"

**LOCKED:** Sheldon suspects something but Washu makes the detection.

---

### Decision 3: Bath Scene Detection Preserved

**Rationale:**
- Canon moment is perfect
- Washu's observation method established
- Clay's hubris (marking everything) is his downfall
- No reason to change

**LOCKED:** Washu detects Zero via bath scene/logo.

---

### Decision 4: Zero's Resolution Unchanged

**Rationale:**
- Merge with Ryoko is elegant solution
- Gives Ryoko emotional growth
- Zero "lives on" within Ryoko
- Canon resolution is satisfying

**LOCKED:** Zero-Ryoko merge happens as canon.

---

## SECTION 1.4: SCENE ADDITIONS

### New Scene: Sheldon's Suspicion

**POV:** Sheldon
**Timing:** During Zero's infiltration

- Serving dinner to household
- "Ryoko" eating differently
- Subtle wrongness in behavior
- Decides to watch more closely
- Doesn't voice suspicions (could be wrong)

---

### New Scene: After Detection

**POV:** Sheldon
**Timing:** After Washu reveals Zero

- Relief (he wasn't imagining things)
- Discusses with Washu
- Washu: "You noticed? Interesting..."
- Seeds her continued interest in his perceptiveness

---

# PART 2: Z / COUNTER-ACTOR ARC

## Years 15-17 (2003-2005): The Cosmic Revelation

---

## SECTION 2.1: CANON BASELINE

**Episodes 14-20: OVA Series 3**

1. **Setup:** Z (Tokimi's champion) sent to test Tenchi
2. **Power:** Z can generate 5 Light Hawk Wings
3. **Attack:** Z attacks Earth, destroys geography
4. **Stakes:** Planet-level destruction capability
5. **Revelation:** Chousin nature revealed (Washu, Tsunami, Tokimi)
6. **Counter-Actor:** Misaki becomes embodiment of resistance to Chousin
7. **Crisis:** Universe-level threat
8. **Resolution:** Tenchi manifests Kami Tenchi form
9. **Aftermath:** Chousin reunited, mysteries revealed

**Key Canon Details:**
- Z was created/empowered by Tokimi
- Washu revealed as Chousin (her sealed nature exposed)
- Tsunami's assimilation with Sasami confirmed
- Counter-Actor represents universal resistance to Chousin experiments
- Kami Tenchi is the being the Chousin were searching for
- Tenchi transcends their power level

---

## SECTION 2.2: WHAT CHANGES

| Element | Canon | Our Story | Reason |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Z's attack** | Happens | HAPPENS | Canon event |
| **Chousin revelation** | Happens | HAPPENS | Major plot point |
| **Sheldon's presence** | N/A | Present | Family member |
| **Do Chousin notice Sheldon?** | N/A | Possible | His anomalous nature |
| **Tenchi's transcendence** | Kami Tenchi | Same | Canon preserved |
| **Cosmos involvement** | N/A | NOT YET | Save for later |

---

## SECTION 2.3: LOCKED DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Z Arc Happens Largely As Canon

**Rationale:**
- Z's motivation is testing Tenchi
- Chousin revelation is core plot point
- Tenchi's transcendence is his character arc
- No reason to change major beats

**LOCKED:** Z arc proceeds as canon.

---

### Decision 2: Sheldon Witnesses Cosmic Revelation

**Rationale:**
- He's part of household
- Would be present during crisis
- Learns about Chousin nature firsthand
- His understanding of universe expands again

**What He Learns:**
- Washu is actually a goddess
- Tsunami is merged with Sasami
- Tokimi exists in higher dimensions
- The universe was created as an experiment
- Tenchi may be what they were looking for

**LOCKED:** Sheldon witnesses Chousin revelation.

---

### Decision 3: Chousin Notice Sheldon (But Don't Prioritize)

**Rationale:**
- During cosmic events, they're focused on bigger issues
- Washu already investigating Sheldon (background)
- His anomaly registers but isn't urgent
- They're occupied with Counter-Actor, Z, Tenchi

**How They Notice:**
- Washu (already knows): "We'll discuss him later"
- Tsunami (through Sasami): Senses something familiar
- Tokimi: Barely notices (focused on experiment results)

**LOCKED:** Chousin notice but don't act on Sheldon during crisis.

---

### Decision 4: Sheldon Does NOT Manifest Powers (Yet)

**Rationale:**
- Even with cosmic-level threat, Lambda Power remains dormant
- Activation requires specific trigger (Cosmos-related)
- Tenchi must be the hero of THIS arc
- Sheldon's time comes during Shadow Arc (original arc)

**LOCKED:** Sheldon remains unpowered during Z arc.

---

### Decision 5: Post-Z Conversation About Sheldon

**Rationale:**
- After crisis resolved
- Washu has time to address her ongoing investigation
- Tsunami-through-Sasami may contribute
- Family discussion about "what is Sheldon?"

**Content:**
- Washu: "I've been studying you. You're not normal."
- Sheldon: "I know. I don't know what I am either."
- Honest conversation about his mystery
- No full answers (preserves mystery)
- Trust established despite unknowns

**LOCKED:** Post-Z conversation addresses Sheldon's nature directly.

---

## SECTION 2.4: TSUNAMI'S PERCEPTION

### What Tsunami Notices

**Through Sasami:**
- Familiar resonance with Sheldon
- "He feels like... something I should know"
- Both expressions of feminine cosmic divine
- NOT identical power, but... rhyming?

**How She Processes:**
- Doesn't immediately understand
- Senses: kindness, protection, sacrifice
- These are HER values too
- Recognizes a "cousin" entity's touch

**What She Doesn't Know:**
- Cosmos's identity
- Lambda Power specifically
- Sailor Moon cosmology

**LOCKED:** Tsunami senses kinship but can't identify source.

---

## SECTION 2.5: POST-CHOUSIN REVELATION STATE

### Household Understanding After Z Arc

**What Everyone Knows:**
- Washu is actually a goddess (sealed)
- Tsunami is merged with Sasami
- A third sister (Tokimi) exists
- The universe is an experiment
- Tenchi is the experiment's success
- Sheldon is "something else" — unknown

**Sheldon's New Position:**
- Was "mysterious but accepted"
- Now "confirmed anomaly among cosmic beings"
- Family trusts him despite mystery
- Washu continuing investigation (friendly)
