## Scene 7.1: Sunday Morning

**Time:** 06:30 - 07:30

The seventh morning felt different before Sheldon opened his eyes.

The light filtering through the shutter was softer, later—the household had allowed itself to sleep past the usual dawn routines. Sunday. No school. No scheduled train arrivals. Just a family, complete for once, breathing together in the mountain quiet.

He rose without urgency, his body finding its way through the now-familiar motions. The squeaky door announced him to whoever was listening, but the hallway sounds that greeted him were not the usual pattern.

Voices from the kitchen. Not one voice—Rea's efficient morning silence—but two.

Sheldon paused at the doorway.

Nobuyuki stood at the counter beside Rea, his tall frame somehow fitting into the domestic space without crowding it. He was measuring tea leaves into the pot with careful attention, his architect's precision applied to this small task. Rea worked beside him, preparing rice, their movements a practiced choreography that spoke of years of shared Sundays.

"Good morning," Sheldon said.

Both turned. Nobuyuki's expression was guarded but not hostile—the assessment continued, but with yesterday's edges softened. Rea's face showed something more complex: relief, perhaps, that the household had survived its first full day together.

"The tea is nearly ready," Nobuyuki said. "I hope you don't mind. I'm particular about the temperature."

"Not at all." Sheldon moved into the kitchen, finding his place in the rhythm. "I've been told I brew it too strong."

"Grandmother's influence?" Nobuyuki asked.

"Southern American. Everything was strong. Coffee, tea, opinions."

A slight smile flickered across Nobuyuki's face—the first hint of humor he'd shown in Sheldon's direction. "Kiyone was the same. Rea has been teaching me subtlety for years."

Rea made a small sound that might have been denial. "You still brew it too dark."

"Old habits." Nobuyuki lifted the pot, testing its weight. "Some things don't change easily."

The morning light strengthened through the windows as they worked. Three people in a kitchen, navigating around each other with varying degrees of familiarity. Sheldon kept his movements small, his presence unobtrusive, allowing the established patterns to continue without disruption.

Somewhere deeper in the residence, a child's voice called out—Tenchi, waking to find his father still present, the joy in that sound unmistakable.

---

## Scene 7.2: Breakfast - Family Complete

**Time:** 07:30 - 08:30

Tenchi appeared in the doorway like a small sunrise, his face radiant with the particular joy of a child whose hopes had been fulfilled. His father was here. His uncle was here. His grandfather and Rea were here. The household was complete.

"DADDY! You're still here!"

Nobuyuki caught him as he launched across the room, lifting him with the practiced ease of years. "Where else would I be? Sunday breakfast is the best meal of the week."

"Because Rea-nee makes extra tamagoyaki?"

"Exactly right."

They settled around the table—five people, more than the space usually held, requiring adjustment and accommodation. Tenchi positioned himself between Nobuyuki and Sheldon, unwilling to choose, his small body a bridge between the adults in his life.

Katsuhito observed from his usual position, his tea cup steady in weathered hands. He said little but saw everything, the way he always did.

"What are we doing today?" Tenchi asked between bites. "Can we go to the waterfall? Can Uncle Sheldon come? Can—"

"Breathe," Nobuyuki said mildly. "Food first. Plans second."

"But there's so much to do! Daddy's only here until tomorrow!"

The words fell into brief silence. The truth of the weekend visit—temporary, bracketed by departures—pressing against the joy like a shadow.

"Then we should make the most of today," Katsuhito said, his voice calm. "What do you propose?"

The planning unfolded in overlapping voices: Tenchi's enthusiastic suggestions, Nobuyuki's gentle redirections, Rea's practical observations about weather and timing. Sheldon listened more than spoke, learning the household's Sunday rhythm.

"I'd like to see the house again," Nobuyuki said eventually, addressing Sheldon directly. "In better light. Without the pressure of first impressions."

"Of course. The roof work is paused—Tanaka doesn't work Sundays—but I can show you what's been done."

"That would be good." Nobuyuki's voice was neutral, but something in his posture had shifted—engagement rather than assessment. "Architecture is my profession. It's difficult for me to see a structure without opinions forming."

"Opinions are welcome. I'm working from necessity, not expertise."

"Sometimes that produces better results." Nobuyuki finished his rice, setting down his chopsticks with precision. "Experts can overthink. Someone who just needs a roof to stop leaking... they focus on what matters."

It was, Sheldon realized, a compliment. Buried in professional language, but genuine.

Tenchi tugged at both their sleeves simultaneously. "Can we go NOW?"

---

## Scene 7.3: Morning at the Shrine

**Time:** 08:30 - 10:00

The shrine claimed the first hours.

Katsuhito performed his morning duties as always—the offerings, the prayers, the careful attention to details that had accumulated over decades of practice. But today he was not alone in his work. Nobuyuki accompanied him, moving through the familiar routines with the ease of long acquaintance.

Sheldon watched from a respectful distance, Tenchi at his side. The boy had accepted that certain parts of the morning belonged to grandfather and father, the rituals of a lineage that stretched back further than his young mind could comprehend.

"Daddy used to do this every day," Tenchi said, his voice soft. "Before Mommy got sick."

"He grew up here?"

"No, but he came a lot. Mommy said he was here more than at his own parents' house." Tenchi's small hand found Sheldon's, the contact natural now. "He says the shrine is in his bones."

Sheldon watched the two figures moving through the courtyard—the old man in his robes, the younger man in weekend clothes, both performing the same motions with the same care. The shrine was in Nobuyuki's bones. Whatever else he had become—city architect, weekend father, grief-burdened widower—this place had shaped him.

"Your mother taught him?" Sheldon asked.

"Mommy taught everybody." Pride filled Tenchi's voice. "She was the best teacher. Rea-nee says so too."

The morning rituals concluded with an offering at the great tree. Sheldon had observed this before—Katsuhito's private communion with Funaho—but today Nobuyuki participated, standing beside his father-in-law in silent acknowledgment of whatever passed between them and the ancient presence.

When they returned, Nobuyuki's expression was softer than before. The shrine had done its work, reminding him of continuities that transcended his weekly visits.

"Thank you," he said to Katsuhito.

"The shrine thanks you for your attention." The old man's reply was formal, but warmth lived beneath the words. "Now—I believe there is a house inspection waiting, and a young man who is about to vibrate through the floor if he is not given activity."

Tenchi's bounce intensified. "Can we go? Can we go NOW?"

---

## Scene 7.4: Descent Together

**Time:** 10:00 - 11:00

The 320 steps felt different with three people descending together.

Sheldon had made this journey many times now—alone, with Katsuhito, following Tenchi's eager lead. But today Nobuyuki walked beside him, their strides naturally synchronizing on the familiar stone, while Tenchi ranged ahead and behind like a small satellite in erratic orbit.

"He counted them for me once," Nobuyuki said, watching his son skip down three steps at a time. "Every step. Announced each number. It took... considerably longer than usual."

"I counted them my first day. Scientist's habit."

"Architect's habit too." Nobuyuki navigated a turn in the path, his body remembering curves his conscious mind had probably forgotten. "I designed a building once with exactly this many steps in its main staircase. No one understood why. Kiyone knew, but she never told anyone."

The mention of his wife came easier today, Sheldon noticed. Still careful, still shadowed, but not the raw wound it had been yesterday.

"The house was her project?" Sheldon asked.

"Her dream. She found documents in Michiko-san's papers—the original construction plans, from when the shop was added. She wanted to restore it someday. Return it to what it had been." Nobuyuki's voice grew quieter. "She never got the chance."

"I found those plans. In a drawer in the back room."

Nobuyuki stopped walking. "You found them?"

"I wasn't sure what they were at first. Old paper, faded ink. But the structure matched the house."

Something shifted in Nobuyuki's expression—the assessment giving way to something more personal. "I'd like to see them. If that's... if you wouldn't mind."

"Of course. They should belong to people who understand them."

They stood on the path, the forest sounds filling the silence between them. Tenchi had run ahead, his voice echoing from somewhere below.

"She would have liked you," Nobuyuki said finally. "Kiyone. She collected people who didn't quite fit. Said they were more interesting than the ones who did."

"I've been told that before. About her."

"Then you know." Nobuyuki resumed walking, his pace slightly faster now, as though the conversation had propelled him forward. "She had good instincts about people. I trusted them. I still do, even though she's not here to have them anymore."

# SCENES 7.5-7.8: House Visit

**Date:** April 9, 1989 (Sunday)  
**Time:** 11:00 - 14:00  
**Location:** Tsukino House  
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon/Nobuyuki)

---

## Scene 7.5: The House

**Time:** 11:00 - 12:00

The Tsukino house looked different through Nobuyuki's eyes.

Sheldon had grown accustomed to seeing it as his project—a problem to be solved, a space to be reclaimed. But watching Nobuyuki move through the rooms, he understood that he was seeing something else entirely: a memorial, a time capsule, a place where someone he had loved had dreamed of possibility.

"She talked about the light here," Nobuyuki said, standing in the main room where morning sun poured through the cleaned windows. "How it moved through the day. She said Michiko-san designed the windows specifically—even the shop addition was oriented to catch the afternoon."

"I noticed. The quality changes every hour."

Nobuyuki ran his hand along the window frame, architect's fingers reading the wood's history. "Traditional joinery. No nails in the original sections. Only the shop uses modern fasteners."

He moved through the space with professional attention, noting details Sheldon had missed: the angle of the eaves, designed to shed snow; the placement of the tokonoma alcove, aligned with the garden view; the subtle asymmetry that gave the rooms their organic feeling.

"The roof work is excellent," he said, examining the repaired section from inside. "Tanaka knows what he's doing."

"He said the same about the original builder."

"Michiko's husband. James." Nobuyuki's voice grew thoughtful. "I never met him—he died before I came into the family. But Kiyone spoke of him. Said he learned traditional techniques because Michiko wouldn't accept anything less."

"An American learning Japanese carpentry."

"Love makes people learn things." Nobuyuki turned from the roof inspection. "You're doing the same, in your way."

The observation landed with unexpected weight. Sheldon had been approaching the restoration as practical necessity—shelter needed, repairs required, work to be done. But Nobuyuki saw something else: devotion expressed through labor, belonging earned through care.

"The plans," Sheldon said. "I'll get them."

The drawer in the back room opened to reveal the documents where he had left them—rolled papers, faded but intact, the architectural dreams of a woman now gone. He carried them to the main room and spread them on the floor between them.

Nobuyuki's breath caught.

"This is her handwriting." His fingers traced notes in the margins—Japanese characters mixed with English words, corrections and alternatives sketched in multiple colors of ink. "She worked on these for months. Every time we visited, she'd show me what she'd added."

"She was planning a full restoration?"

"More than that." Nobuyuki unrolled the largest sheet, revealing floor plans that didn't quite match the current structure. "She wanted to add a wing. A study, a workspace—she called it her 'thinking room.' She said Michiko had always wanted one, but the shop took priority."

Sheldon looked at the plans with new eyes. Not just restoration—transformation. A dream built on another dream, generations of women imagining possibility into these walls.

"I didn't know," he said.

"How could you?" Nobuyuki's voice was gentle. "You inherited a house. She inherited a vision."

---

## Scene 7.6: Lunch at the House

**Time:** 12:00 - 13:00

Rea had packed extra bento.

They spread lunch on the cleared floor of the main room, the three of them arranged in a rough circle with the architectural plans rolled carefully to one side. Tenchi had exhausted himself exploring the garden and now leaned against his father, drowsy and content.

"Rea thinks of everything," Nobuyuki observed, examining the careful compartments of the bento.

"She learned from Kiyone-sama," Sheldon said. "That's what everyone tells me."

"She did." Nobuyuki's chopsticks paused over a piece of tamago. "Rea was... difficult when she first came. Kiyone spent years teaching her that care could be expressed through preparation. That anticipating needs was a form of love."

"She mentioned the institution. Briefly."

"Did she?" Genuine surprise crossed Nobuyuki's face. "She doesn't usually speak of that time. Not even to me."

Sheldon absorbed this information. Rea's disclosure—minimal as it had been—represented more trust than he had realized. The barriers she maintained were not just for strangers.

"She said Kiyone reached her when no one else could."

"Kiyone had that gift." Nobuyuki's voice softened with memory. "She saw people as they could be, not just as they were. It made her a remarkable teacher. And a remarkable mother."

Tenchi stirred at the word, his eyes fluttering open. "Mommy," he murmured, not quite awake.

"Yes, little one. We were talking about Mommy."

"She's in the tree." Tenchi's voice was dreamy, hovering at the edge of sleep. "And in the cooking. And in the stories. That's what Rea-nee says."

"That's right." Nobuyuki's hand smoothed his son's hair. "She's everywhere we remember her."

The room held its breath—three people and a sleeping child, surrounded by one woman's plans and another woman's memory. The afternoon light moved across the floor exactly as Michiko had designed it to, illuminating spaces that waited to be filled.

---

## Scene 7.7: Afternoon Work

**Time:** 13:00 - 14:00

Nobuyuki insisted on contributing.

"I'm not just an observer," he said, rolling up his sleeves. "If this house is going to be part of my son's life, I want to have touched it."

They worked together in the garden—clearing overgrowth, assessing damage, discussing possibilities. Nobuyuki's professional eye identified problems Sheldon had missed: drainage issues near the foundation, a section of wall that would need attention before winter, the subtle signs of settling that came with age.

"You could make this sustainable," Nobuyuki said, surveying their progress. "With proper maintenance, another fifty years easily. Longer if you address the foundation."

"Is that your professional assessment?"

"Professional and personal." Nobuyuki wiped soil from his hands. "Tenchi is attached to this place now. To you. Whatever future this house has, it will include him. I need to know it's sound."

The directness was unexpected—Nobuyuki dropping his careful neutrality for honest investment. Sheldon met his eyes.

"I'm not planning to leave."

"People rarely plan to leave. They just... do." Something old moved behind Nobuyuki's expression. "I didn't plan to leave Kiyone. I certainly didn't plan to become a weekend father."

"But you come back. Every Saturday."

"It's not enough." The words came hard, dragged from somewhere deep. "I know it's not enough. The job takes more than I want to give it, but I can't leave the job because the job pays for Tenchi's future. So I give what I can and hope it's sufficient."

"He knows you love him."

"Does he?" Nobuyuki looked toward the garden, where Tenchi was building something from sticks and stones. "Sometimes I think I'm just a visitor in his life. Someone who appears and disappears according to train schedules."

"You're his father. Nothing changes that."

"No. But you're here every day. You tuck him in. You tell him stories." Nobuyuki's voice carried no accusation—just acknowledgment. "You're becoming something I can only be part-time."

Sheldon chose his words carefully. "I'm not trying to replace you."

"I know." Nobuyuki surprised him with something like a smile. "If I thought you were, we wouldn't be having this conversation. You'd already be gone."

"Then what are we having? This conversation?"

"Negotiation, perhaps. Or... collaboration." Nobuyuki turned to face him fully. "Tenchi needs more than I can give him alone. More than Father can give, or Rea. He needs people who will stay. Who will teach him and hold him and be present for the thousand small moments I have to miss."

"You're asking me to—"

"I'm asking you to continue doing what you're already doing. Being here. Being steady." Nobuyuki's gaze was intense. "And I'm asking you to understand that I will always be his father. Even when I can't be present. Even when you're the one he runs to first."

The garden held its silence. Tenchi's voice drifted over from his construction project, narrating to himself in the way children did.

"I understand," Sheldon said.

"Do you?"

"I had a father. And people who weren't my father but helped raise me anyway." Sheldon thought of his grandmother, his teachers, the various adults who had filled gaps his parents couldn't reach. "They weren't competing. They were... expanding what family meant."

Nobuyuki was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice had lost its careful edge.

"Kiyone would have said something like that. Exactly like that." He turned back to the garden work, reaching for a trowel. "Let's finish this section. Tenchi wants to plant something before we leave."

---

## Scene 7.8: Tenchi's Garden

**Time:** 14:00 - 14:30

Tenchi's project required everyone's participation.

He had selected a corner of the garden—cleared now of weeds, soil dark and waiting—and declared it his own. "This is where I'm going to plant things," he announced. "Like Mommy did. So the house knows someone loves it."

Nobuyuki produced seeds from his pocket—brought from the city, Sheldon realized, prepared in advance for exactly this moment. Morning glories, the package said. They would climb the fence if given support, blooming blue and purple through the summer.

"These were Mommy's favorite," Tenchi said, handling the seeds with reverent care. "She had them on the balcony. Remember, Daddy?"

"I remember." Nobuyuki's voice was thick. "They covered the whole railing by August."

They planted together—Tenchi making the holes, Nobuyuki placing the seeds, Sheldon covering them with soil and patting it firm. A small ritual, a living connection between past and future.

"Now the house knows," Tenchi declared when the last seed was buried. "It knows we're going to take care of it."

"Houses know these things," Sheldon agreed. "They feel it when someone pays attention."

"Like the shrine feels Grandpa?"

"Exactly like that."

Tenchi surveyed his work with satisfaction, then looked up at both adults with the particular intensity of a child about to say something important.

"I want Uncle Sheldon to live here," he said. "When it's fixed. But I want him to stay close, so I can visit him. And he can visit me."

The statement required no response. It was a declaration of intent, a child's way of ordering the world.

Nobuyuki met Sheldon's eyes over Tenchi's head. Something passed between them—acknowledgment, agreement, the beginning of understanding.

"That sounds like a good plan," Nobuyuki said.

# SCENES 7.9-7.11: Afternoon Return

**Date:** April 9, 1989 (Sunday)  
**Time:** 14:30 - 18:00  
**Location:** Path → Shrine residence  
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

## Scene 7.9: Return Climb

**Time:** 14:30 - 15:30

The climb back felt different than the descent.

Something had shifted in the hours at the house—not resolution exactly, but the beginning of understanding. Nobuyuki walked beside Sheldon now rather than ahead, their pace synchronized in the unconscious way of people who had found common ground.

Tenchi ran between them, touching both, connecting them with the physical bridge of his small body. "I planted seeds!" he announced to no one in particular, and to everyone. "They're going to be SO TALL. Taller than Daddy. Maybe taller than the house!"

"Morning glories don't grow quite that tall," Nobuyuki said, amused.

"Mine will. Because I told them to."

The certainty of childhood—the belief that intention alone could shape the world. Sheldon remembered that feeling, distantly. Before physics had taught him how many forces operated beyond human will.

But then again, some things did respond to attention. Gardens. Houses. Relationships. Perhaps the child's faith wasn't entirely misplaced.

"He has her confidence," Nobuyuki said quietly, watching his son bound up the steps ahead of them. "Kiyone believed she could convince anything to grow. Usually she was right."

"A gift."

"A responsibility." Nobuyuki's voice carried weight. "Teaching him to believe while also teaching him to accept limits. I'm not always sure I manage both."

They reached the two-hundred step landing where the path branched—one way to the shrine, the other winding toward something Sheldon had never explored. Tenchi paused there, looking back with expectant eyes.

"Can we go the long way? The waterfall way? Please?"

Nobuyuki hesitated. "It's a longer climb on the return."

"But Uncle Sheldon hasn't SEEN it. And it's important. You said it was important."

The waterfall. Sheldon remembered the story from dinner—Nobuyuki's failed attempt at swimming, Kiyone's rescue, the kiss that had followed. Important indeed.

"Another time," Nobuyuki said, but his voice was gentle. "Today we should get back. Rea will have dinner preparations underway."

"Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow I have to go back to the city, little one. But—" Nobuyuki looked at Sheldon. "Perhaps Uncle Sheldon could take you sometime. When the weather is right."

The invitation was implicit: stay. Become part of the rhythms Nobuyuki couldn't maintain. Fill the spaces he had to leave empty.

"I'd like that," Sheldon said. "When the weather is right."

---

## Scene 7.10: Afternoon at the Shrine

**Time:** 15:30 - 17:00

The shrine embraced their return with its usual patience.

Katsuhito was on the engawa when they emerged from the trees, tea already prepared, his weathered face giving nothing away. But Sheldon had learned to read the old man's silences, and this one carried satisfaction.

"The house inspection went well," Katsuhito observed. It was not a question.

"The house has good bones," Nobuyuki replied, settling beside his father-in-law. "Good plans. Good intentions."

"And good hands to execute them?"

Nobuyuki glanced at Sheldon, who had taken a position slightly apart—included but not intruding. "Good enough. He listens to the materials. That's more important than experience."

The compliment was professional, but Sheldon heard the personal acknowledgment beneath it. Not quite acceptance, but the foundation for it. The willingness to build.

Tenchi had claimed Rea's attention the moment they arrived, dragging her to the kitchen to report on his garden with exhaustive detail. His voice filtered through the residence, bright counterpoint to the quiet conversation on the engawa.

"He's attached to everyone now," Katsuhito said. "Not just you. Not just Rea. Everyone."

"Is that a problem?" Nobuyuki asked.

"It's a development." The old man's eyes moved to Sheldon. "Attachments can be sources of joy or sources of pain. Usually both. The question is whether the joy justifies the risk of pain."

"And your assessment?"

"My assessment is that life without attachment is not life at all. Merely existence." Katsuhito lifted his tea cup in what might have been a toast. "We are meant to connect. The pain that follows is the price of having loved at all."

Nobuyuki was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was rougher than before.

"I keep expecting the pain to ease. Three years now. It should be easier."

"Should it?" Katsuhito's tone was gentle. "Kiyone was remarkable. The hole she left is proportional to what she was. A small grief would insult her memory."

"I'm tired of hurting."

"Then stop expecting to stop. Accept the pain as proof of love, and let it live beside the other things." The old man set down his cup. "You can carry grief and joy simultaneously. Humans are built for it. We simply forget, sometimes, that we don't have to choose."

The afternoon light moved across the shrine, painting everything in gold. Sheldon listened without speaking, aware that this conversation was not for him but that being present for it mattered somehow.

"Sheldon understands loss," Nobuyuki said eventually. "I can see it in how he moves. Careful, like someone who's learned that things can be taken."

"Most people learn that eventually."

"But not everyone learns to keep going. To rebuild." Nobuyuki turned to look at Sheldon directly. "How did you? After whatever it was you lost?"

The question caught Sheldon unprepared. His losses were multiple and layered—the death in the accelerator, the world left behind, the life that had been erased. But he couldn't speak of those.

"I found something worth building toward," he said instead. "A reason to keep moving. The pain didn't stop, but it became... fuel. Energy for the work."

Nobuyuki nodded slowly. "Tenchi is my reason. The buildings are just... motion. Keeping busy so I don't stop."

"That's enough, for now." Katsuhito rose, signaling the conversation's end. "Motion becomes purpose, given time. You're still finding your way. We all are."

---

## Scene 7.11: Evening Preparations

**Time:** 17:00 - 18:00

The kitchen held everyone.

It wasn't designed for so many bodies, but somehow they fit—Rea commanding the stove, Nobuyuki assisting with an expertise that surprised Sheldon, Tenchi "helping" in ways that required constant supervision, Sheldon handling the tasks no one else had claimed.

"He cooks?" Sheldon asked Rea quietly, gesturing toward Nobuyuki's competent knife work.

"Kiyone-sama taught him. She said any parent should be able to feed their child." Rea's voice was soft, her hands steady on the pot she was stirring. "He practiced for months before she trusted him with a blade."

"And now?"

"Now he comes home and cooks for Tenchi every Saturday night. It's their ritual." Something complicated moved across Rea's face. "He guards it. Won't let anyone else participate."

Sheldon watched Nobuyuki work—the careful cuts, the practiced movements, the focused attention that blocked out everything else. A father preparing food for his son, the same way his wife had prepared it, keeping her alive through repetition.

"What does he make?"

"Whatever Tenchi asks for. Tonight it's curry. Tenchi's been requesting it for weeks."

The kitchen filled with the smells of simmering spices, the sounds of oil and water and the particular rhythm of domestic work. Tenchi had been given charge of the rice cooker—pressing the button with ceremonial seriousness—and now narrated the countdown with increasing excitement.

"The rice is THINKING," he announced. "It's getting ready to be fluffy. You can't rush fluffy."

"Sound advice," Nobuyuki said without looking up from his cutting board. "Patience produces better results in most things."

"Is that why you take so long to design buildings?"

"Exactly why. And why the buildings stay standing instead of falling down."

"Uncle Sheldon's house is staying standing."

"It is. Because Tanaka-san was patient with the repairs, and Uncle Sheldon was patient with the planning."

The conversation felt natural—a family discussing ordinary things, their various histories woven into the present without disrupting it. Sheldon let himself be part of it, contributing where needed, stepping back where he wasn't.

This was what belonging could feel like. Not perfectly integrated, not without tension, but present. Participating. Part of the rhythm rather than observing it from outside.

**Time:** 18:00 - 19:30

Nobuyuki's curry was excellent.

Rich and fragrant, spiced in ways that suggested both study and practice, it filled the dining room with warmth that went beyond temperature. Tenchi attacked his plate with enthusiasm that bordered on worship, pausing only to announce—between bites—that "Daddy's curry is the BEST curry."

"It's Mommy's recipe," Nobuyuki said quietly. "I'm just following instructions."

"You modified the instructions," Rea observed. "She never used this much garam masala."

"She told me to experiment. Before she—" Nobuyuki caught himself, glancing at Tenchi. "Before. She said I should make it mine."

The table held its breath for a moment, then released it. Death had been invited to dinner, acknowledged, and allowed to sit peacefully in the corner without dominating the conversation.

"I think she'd approve," Katsuhito said. "She always appreciated improvement on a theme."

"Even when I improved her shrine sweeping technique?"

"That was not improvement. That was heresy." But the old man's eyes crinkled with humor. "Though I admit the stones were cleaner than they'd been in decades."

Nobuyuki laughed—a real laugh, full and warm, the first Sheldon had heard from him. The sound transformed his face, erasing years of grief, revealing the young man who had once jumped into a waterfall to impress the woman he loved.

Tenchi looked up at the sound, his face breaking into matching joy. "Daddy's laughing! Daddy, you're LAUGHING."

"Grandpa told a joke."

"Tell me!"

"You had to be there." Nobuyuki reached over to ruffle his son's hair. "Some jokes only work when you know the history."

The conversation flowed from there—easier than it had been, the barriers between them lowered by shared food and honest exchange. Nobuyuki asked about Sheldon's physics work, showing genuine curiosity about theoretical concepts that most people avoided. Sheldon found himself explaining particle interactions in terms of architectural stress distributions, and watching Nobuyuki's eyes light up with understanding.

"You think like a builder," Nobuyuki said eventually. "Looking for the load-bearing elements. The fundamental supports."

"Physics is just architecture at a smaller scale."

"Or architecture is physics made visible." Nobuyuki finished his curry and set down his chopsticks. "Either way, we're both trying to understand how things hold together."

"And what happens when they don't."

"Especially that." Nobuyuki's voice softened. "Knowing how things fall apart is the first step in learning how to rebuild them."

## Scene 7.13: Bedtime - Final Night Together

**Time:** 19:30 - 20:30

Nobuyuki claimed bedtime duty.

"I only get to do this once a week," he said, scooping up a drowsy Tenchi. "The least you can do is let me have the privilege."

Sheldon stepped back without argument, understanding the gift being offered and received. The story tonight would be Nobuyuki's to tell—father and son, their private ritual, unmarred by strangers.

But Tenchi had other ideas.

"Wait!" He struggled in his father's arms, reaching toward Sheldon. "Uncle Sheldon has to come too. He's PART OF IT now."

Nobuyuki hesitated, his expression complex. Then he looked at Sheldon and nodded once—permission granted, boundaries expanded.

"If Uncle Sheldon wants to."

"I'd be honored."

The three of them settled in Tenchi's room, the small space made smaller by adult bodies. Nobuyuki sat against the wall with Tenchi in his lap; Sheldon took a position near the door, present but not central.

"Which story tonight?" Nobuyuki asked.

"The one about the rabbit and the moon."

"Ah. An old one." Nobuyuki's voice shifted into the cadence of storytelling—rhythmic, warm, practiced. "Long ago, when the world was younger than it is now, there was a rabbit who lived on the earth and dreamed of touching the moon..."

The story unfolded in familiar patterns—the rabbit's longing, the journey, the discovery that the moon had always been closer than it seemed. Sheldon had heard variations of this tale before, fragments of Japanese folklore filtered through American collections. But Nobuyuki's telling had something extra: pauses where Kiyone must have paused, emphases that carried her voice through his.

Tenchi's eyes grew heavy as the story wound toward its end. By the final lines, he was more asleep than awake, his small body relaxed against his father's chest.

"And the rabbit learned," Nobuyuki concluded softly, "that home isn't always where you start. Sometimes it's where you end up. Sometimes it finds you before you find it."

He looked up at Sheldon over his sleeping son's head.

"She told it that way," he said. "The last line. That was hers."

"It's a good ending."

"Yes." Nobuyuki carefully extracted himself from Tenchi's grip, settling the boy onto his futon with practiced gentleness. "She always knew how to end things. Cleanly. With hope."

They stood together in the doorway, watching the small form breathe in the dim light.

"Thank you," Nobuyuki said. "For being here. For letting me share this."

"Thank you for including me."

Something shifted between them—the last barrier falling, or at least lowering enough to step over. They left the room together, sliding the door closed on a sleeping child who had, without knowing it, bound them both to this place.

## Scene 7.14: Night - Last Evening

**Time:** 20:30 - 22:00

The engawa claimed them for the final hours.

Rea had retreated to her room—Sunday evening was preparation time for the week ahead, lessons to review, uniforms to ready. Katsuhito had slipped away after dinner with a knowing nod, leaving the younger men to find their own peace.

Sheldon and Nobuyuki sat in the darkness, tea cooling between them, the great tree's silhouette visible against the star-scattered sky.

"I leave tomorrow morning," Nobuyuki said. "Early train. I like to be gone before Tenchi wakes up—it's easier for both of us when he doesn't have to watch me go."

"He'll understand eventually."

"Will he?" The question carried real uncertainty. "I'm not sure I understand it myself. The necessity of leaving. The impossibility of staying."

"The work matters. You said so yourself—it pays for his future."

"It does. And I'm good at it. Really good." Nobuyuki's voice held neither pride nor complaint—just acknowledgment. "But sometimes I wonder if I chose it because I loved it, or because it was something I could throw myself into when loving hurt too much."

"Does the reason matter, if the result is the same?"

"Kiyone would have said yes. That intention shapes outcome." Nobuyuki was quiet for a moment. "She was usually right about things like that."

The night sounds settled around them—wind in the trees, distant wildlife, the particular silence of a mountain shrine after dark. Funaho's presence pressed against the edges of Sheldon's awareness, watching as it always watched.

"You feel it too," Nobuyuki said suddenly. "The tree. I can tell by how you look at it."

"I feel something. I don't know what."

"Neither do I. Neither does Father, though he pretends otherwise." Nobuyuki turned to face the tree directly. "Kiyone said it was alive in ways we couldn't understand. That it had been here before the shrine, before the village, before any of us. She said it was waiting for something."

"Did she say what?"

"No. Just that it would know when the time came." Nobuyuki's voice was soft. "She had dreams about it sometimes. Vivid ones. She'd wake up speaking languages I didn't recognize."

Sheldon filed this information away, adding it to his growing collection of mysteries. The tree. The shrine. The family's unusual depth of history. Something connected it all, but the pattern remained just beyond his grasp.

"Take care of them," Nobuyuki said, rising. "When I can't be here. That's all I ask."

"I will."

"And—" He paused at the door, looking back. "Take care of yourself too. This place demands a lot from people. Don't let it drain you."

"Speaking from experience?"

"Speaking from observation." A slight smile. "Good night, Sheldon."

"Good night."

The door slid closed. Footsteps retreated down the hallway. Sheldon sat alone with the darkness and the tree and the weight of promises made.

Tomorrow the household would contract again, returning to its weekday rhythm. But something fundamental had changed. He was no longer an outsider being assessed. He was part of the structure now, load-bearing in his own small way.

Sleep came eventually, carrying him toward the eighth morning of his new life.
