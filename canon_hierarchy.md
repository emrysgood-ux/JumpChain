## TIER 1: SOURCE CANON

### Definition
Official source material from original works.

### For Tenchi Muyo - Complete Priority List

| Priority | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **1A** | OVA 1-5 | Primary visual canon |
| **1B** | 101 Tenchi Muyo Secrets | Authoritative Q&A (Kajishima supervised) |
| **1C** | True Tenchi Muyo! novels | Kajishima-authored prose |
| **1D** | GXP novels (18 volumes) | Kajishima's "producer's cut" |
| **2** | Kajishima doujinshi | Creator's supplemental materials |
| **3A** | GXP anime | Same continuity (novels supersede) |
| **3B** | War on Geminar | Same continuity |
| **4** | Paradise War novels | Later continuity |

### 101 TENCHI MUYO SECRETS - Authoritative Source

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Japanese Title** | 天地無用！101の謎 (Tenchi Muyo! 101 no Nazo) |
| **English Title** | 101 Tenchi Muyo Facts/Secrets |
| **Published** | May 30, 1994 |
| **Publisher** | Cinema Ten-Day Report Corporation |
| **Author** | Yousuke Kuroda |
| **Supervision** | Masaki Kajishima (direct) |
| **ISBN** | 4-87376-084-4 |
| **Pages** | 230 |
| **Canon Status** | AUTHORITATIVE |

**Why It's Tier 1:**
- Written under Kajishima's direct supervision
- Answers 101 specific canonical questions
- Published during original OVA production
- Contains information not available elsewhere
- Creator-sanctioned interpretations

### GXP NOVELS - Canonical Prose

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Volumes** | 18+ (ongoing as of 2025) |
| **Author** | Masaki Kajishima |
| **Status** | CANON (trumps GXP anime when conflicts exist) |
| **Translation** | Fan translations available (Eff Efferson) |

**Why GXP Novels > GXP Anime:**
- Kajishima was reportedly unhappy with anime director's liberties
- Started writing novels as alternative/correction
- OVA 4 and 5 follow novel continuity, not anime
- Novels contain expanded details and corrections

### For Sailor Moon (Cosmos)
| Source | Priority | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Manga (Cosmos arc) | Highest | Original source |
| Sailor Moon Crystal | Medium | Closer to manga |
| Stars anime | Lower | Different interpretation |

### Excluded From Canon
- Tenchi Universe (different continuity)
- Tenchi in Tokyo (different continuity)
- Movies with "Achika" (different continuity)
- Fanon, wikis (unverified - except as research aid)
- Most games (except Spaceship Agga Ruter)

### GAMES - Canon Status

**Canon (Only One):**

**Non-Canon (All Others):**
- Tenchi Muyo! Game Hen (SNES) - English patch available, non-canon

## TIER 2: PRIOR DECISIONS

### Definition
Decisions made in previous sessions that established story facts.

### Examples
- Sheldon's birth year (1987, not 1978)
- Step count (320, not 300 or 500)
- Kiyone is Tenchi's mother (not Achika)
- Death date (October 23, 2025)

### Rule
Once established ON-PAGE or in official corrections, prior decisions are binding unless explicitly retconned.

### Finding Prior Decisions
- conversation_search tool
- Corrections log
- Session manifests

---

## TIER 3: STORY BIBLE

### Definition
This document system—the modular Bible you're reading.

### Authority
- Governs story-specific interpretations
- Applies canon to THIS story
- Contains character profiles, timelines, rules
- Updated per Law 22

### When Bible Conflicts With Canon
- Canon wins for FACTS
- Bible wins for INTERPRETATION
- Example: Canon says Yosho is ~700 years old. Bible specifies ~730 for this story.

---

## TIER 4: CODEX

### Definition
MASTER_CODEX governance system.

### Authority
- Governs HOW work is done
- Process and compliance rules
- Does not override story content
- Provides framework for decisions

### Relationship to Bible
- Codex GOVERNS Bible (process)
- Bible IMPLEMENTS Codex (content)
- They are coupled documents

---

## TIER 5: CURRENT WORK

### Definition
Content created in the active session.

### Authority
- Subject to verification
- Must not contradict Tiers 1-4
- Becomes Tier 2 after session

### Workflow
1. Create content
2. Verify against higher tiers
3. Correct if needed
4. Lock as Prior Decision

---

## TIER 6: RESEARCH

### Definition
Web searches, reference lookups, external sources.

### Authority
- Informational only
- Must be verified against canon
- Useful for details (1989 Japan, etc.)
- Not authoritative for story facts

### Use Cases
- Historical accuracy (dates, events)
- Cultural details (Japanese customs)
- Technical accuracy (science concepts)
- Location research (Okayama)

---

## TIER 7: MEMORY

### Definition
Assistant's training knowledge.

### Authority
- Lowest tier
- Use only when tools unavailable
- Always verify if possible
- May be outdated or incorrect

### Why Lowest?
- Training data has cutoff
- May contain errors
- Cannot verify source
- Tools provide better accuracy

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### When Tiers Conflict

| Conflict | Winner | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Canon vs. Bible | Canon | Facts are immutable |
| Prior Decision vs. New Info | Prior Decision | Consistency |
| Bible vs. Current Work | Bible | Established > New |
| Research vs. Memory | Research | Verifiable source |

### Escalation Path
1. Check higher tier
2. If ambiguous, flag for user
3. Document decision
4. Update appropriate tier

---

## PRACTICAL APPLICATION

### Before Writing
1. Check forbidden words (Canon constraint)
2. Check prior decisions (What's established?)
3. Check Bible (Character knowledge states)
4. Check Codex (Process requirements)

### During Writing
5. Create content (Current Work)
6. Verify against hierarchy
7. Flag conflicts

### After Writing
8. Update Bible (new facts)
9. Log in corrections if needed
10. Content becomes Prior Decision
