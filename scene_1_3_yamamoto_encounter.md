## SCENE 1.3: THE YAMAMOTO ENCOUNTER

**April 3, 1989 — ~15:50 JST**
**Location:** Roadside near Kamogata, Okayama Prefecture
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The truck rolled to a stop ten meters ahead of where Sheldon stood, tires crunching on loose gravel at the road's edge. Through the windshield he could see the driver leaning forward, peering at him with the particular expression of someone trying to make sense of something unexpected.

Sheldon understood that expression. He was, after all, a Black man standing alone on a rural Japanese road in 1989.

The calculation was automatic, running in the background of his mind the way such calculations always did when he was somewhere new, somewhere unfamiliar with people who looked like him. Not fear—he'd stopped feeling fear about this years ago, had learned to treat it as data rather than threat. Just awareness. Recognition of the social mathematics that governed how he would be perceived before he opened his mouth, before anyone knew anything about him except the color of his skin.

Rural Japan in the late 1980s had perhaps a few thousand Black residents in the entire country. Maybe fewer. The American military bases concentrated most of them in Okinawa and a handful of other locations; the rest were scattered—businesspeople, academics, the occasional tourist who'd wandered far from the typical routes. Out here, in agricultural Okayama, the driver of this truck might never have seen a Black person in his life except on television.

Sheldon kept his posture open, unthreatening, and waited.

The driver's door opened. A man climbed out—short, wiry, weathered in the way farmers were weathered everywhere in the world, his skin darkened by decades of sun and his hands thick-knuckled from decades of labor. He wore khaki work pants and a dark blue cotton shirt, a cap with what looked like an agricultural cooperative logo pushed back on his head. Sixty, maybe sixty-five. Old enough to have memories of the war, of Americans as occupiers before they became allies.

The man walked toward Sheldon with the unhurried gait of someone who had never had reason to rush anywhere. His eyes stayed on Sheldon's face—not hostile, not fearful, just assessing. Taking the measure of something new.

"Daijoubu desu ka?" The question came out in a low, unhurried voice, the vowels shaped by what Sheldon recognized as rural Okayama dialect. *Are you okay?*

Not *what are you doing here* or *who are you* or any of the dozen defensive openings the situation might have prompted. Just concern. A stranger on a road, looking tired and somewhat disheveled, clearly in need of something. The instinct to help before the instinct to question.

Sheldon felt something loosen in his chest.

"Hai, daijoubu desu." He kept his own Japanese neutral, polite, the standard Tokyo-inflected speech he'd learned in Kyoto rather than any regional variation. "Sumimasen, chotto michi ni mayotte shimatte..." *I'm fine. Excuse me, I seem to have gotten a bit lost...*

The farmer's eyebrows rose. Not dramatically—just a small shift, the kind of micro-expression that people made when reality diverged from expectation. A Black man on a rural road was unusual. A Black man on a rural road who spoke Japanese with the fluency of someone who had lived in the country for years was something else entirely.

"Your Japanese is good." The farmer said it as simple observation, not compliment. A fact being noted.

"I lived in Kyoto for some time. For work." Sheldon gestured vaguely, the kind of motion that suggested a longer story he wasn't going to tell in full. "But I'm not familiar with this area. I'm looking for Kamogata—the village?"

Something shifted in the farmer's expression. "Kamogata. That's where I'm headed." He tilted his head, studying Sheldon with renewed interest. "You have business there?"

This was the moment. The first test of the story he'd been given.

"Family business," Sheldon said. "My great-aunt passed away some years ago—Tsukino Michiko. She left property that I'm finally coming to claim."

The name landed like a stone in still water.

"Tsukino." The farmer repeated it slowly, something changing behind his eyes. "You're the Tsukino nephew? From America?"

*Yamamoto*, Sheldon's mind supplied, the connection snapping into place. *The letter. The family watching the house.*

"My name is Tsukino Sheldon," he said, allowing a small bow—not deep, but respectful. "My mother was Tsukino Yuki. She grew up here, before she emigrated."

The farmer's face transformed. The cautious assessment gave way to something warmer, something that looked almost like recognition even though they had never met. He pulled off his cap and ran a hand through thinning gray hair, shaking his head slowly.

"Yuki-chan," he said, and the diminutive carried decades of memory. "I knew her. When we were young—before the war, she was..." He stopped, collected himself, put the cap back on. "I'm Yamamoto Takeshi. Your uncle wrote to me. Said you might be coming."

Yamamoto.

The infrastructure of care, made visible. Uncle Kiyoshi in Osaka, writing letters to coordinate Sheldon's arrival. The Yamamoto family here, watching the house, waiting for the nephew who might someday appear to claim it. A network of obligation and assistance that Sheldon had not built, had not earned, but that existed nonetheless—real and functional and already working on his behalf.

"My uncle mentioned your family," Sheldon said. "He said you'd been keeping an eye on the property. I'm grateful."

Takeshi waved the gratitude away with a rough hand. "The house needed watching. Your aunt Michiko was a good neighbor for forty years. What else would we do?" He looked Sheldon up and down again, but differently now—not assessing a stranger but evaluating a known quantity, someone who had shifted from *unexpected foreigner* to *Yuki-chan's son* in the space of a few sentences. "You look tired. Have you walked far?"

"From the field up the hill. Near the old castle ruins."

"That's a walk." Takeshi turned back toward his truck, gesturing for Sheldon to follow. "Come. I'll take you to the village. We can talk on the way."

---

The truck's cab smelled of fertilizer and tobacco, the particular combination of agriculture and habit that Sheldon associated with his grandfather's friends back in Georgia. The seat was worn vinyl, tan and cracked in places, molded by years of use into a shape that suggested someone about Takeshi's size. A small charm hung from the rearview mirror—an omamori, the kind sold at shrines for traffic safety, its fabric faded but the embroidered characters still legible.

"Masaki Shrine," Takeshi said, noticing Sheldon's glance. "Up the mountain, past where you'll be staying. Good shrine. Old priest there, Masaki Katsuhito—knew your grandmother Hana, back in the day."

Sheldon filed the information away. A shrine nearby. A priest named Masaki. More threads in the web he was only beginning to perceive.

"The house," he said as the truck pulled back onto the road, engine rattling with the comfortable complaint of machinery that had done its job for years. "My uncle's letter mentioned it needed some work. The roof?"

Takeshi made a sound that was half grunt, half laugh. "The roof needs more than work. Needs replacing, most of it. Michiko-san couldn't keep up with repairs the last few years—her health, you understand. We patched what we could, but..." He shrugged, the motion eloquent. "You'll see. It's not falling down. Just needs attention."

"I expected as much." Sheldon watched the landscape slide past—paddies giving way to orchards, orchards to the first scattered buildings of what must be the village's outskirts. "I'm planning to take the time to do it properly. I'm on sabbatical from work. A year to get things sorted."

"Sabbatical." Takeshi pronounced the English word carefully, uncertain of its shape. "Like a vacation?"

"More like... permitted time away. To rest. To think about what comes next." Sheldon paused, considering how much to share, then decided that more truth was better than less. "My mother passed away four years ago. It took time to settle her affairs, to arrange things so I could come here. This is the first chance I've had to actually see the place she grew up."

The truck slowed as they approached a curve, Takeshi's hands steady on the wheel. "Yuki-chan," he said again, quietly. "She was a few years younger than me. Pretty girl. Laughed a lot, I remember. When she left for America..." He trailed off, the unfinished sentence carrying its own weight. When she left, she left for good. She never came back, except in letters and photographs and the son who now sat in his truck.

"She talked about this place," Sheldon said. It wasn't true—he had no memories of his mother talking about anything, because his mother was a construction, a story written into reality by something he didn't understand—but it felt like the kind of thing that should be true. The kind of thing a real son would say. "She missed it, I think. Even though she made her life in America."

"Home stays with you." Takeshi nodded, as if this confirmed something he'd always believed. "No matter how far you go."

---

The village emerged from the landscape gradually, not announced by any sign or boundary but simply accumulating—more buildings, closer together; a proper road surface instead of patched asphalt; telephone poles with more wires connecting to more destinations. They passed a small shop with vegetables displayed outside, an old woman sweeping the step who looked up as the truck went by. Passed a cluster of houses with tile roofs in various states of repair. Passed what might have been a school, though Sheldon only caught a glimpse of playground equipment before it disappeared behind them.

"The main road goes through to Fukuyama eventually," Takeshi said, gesturing ahead. "But your house—the Tsukino house—it's off to the north. I'll take you as far as the turn, but after that..." He hesitated, something uncomfortable entering his expression. "The road gets rough. My truck can make it, but it's easier if you walk the last part. Maybe three hundred meters."

"That's fine." Sheldon's legs had recovered enough during the drive; he could manage three hundred meters. "I appreciate the ride this far."

"You'll need supplies," Takeshi said, the practical concern of someone who had spent a lifetime thinking about such things. "The house has been empty—no food, maybe no water if the pipes have problems. There's a store near the shrine path, Haruna-san's place. She keeps late hours. Tell her Yamamoto sent you, she'll help you get started."

Haruna-san. Another name for the growing list. Another thread in the web.

"The shrine you mentioned," Sheldon said. "Masaki Shrine. Is that far from the house?"

"Just up the hill. Three hundred steps to the top, maybe more—I stopped counting years ago." Takeshi chuckled, a warm sound. "The old priest comes down to the village sometimes. Good man. Quiet. His grandson lives with him—little boy, maybe four or five now. Lost his mother last year." The chuckle faded into something more somber. "Sad business, that. The boy's father works in the city, can't take care of him alone. So Masaki-san raises him."

A priest with a grandson. A little boy who'd lost his mother. The details accumulated, painting a picture of a community with its own histories, its own griefs, its own interconnected lives that Sheldon was about to become part of.

The truck slowed again, pulling to the side of the road near a narrow path that branched off between two weathered stone walls. "This is the turn," Takeshi said. "Follow the path, bear left at the fork, you'll see the house. Can't miss it—it's the one that looks like it's been waiting."

Sheldon reached for the door handle, then paused. "Yamamoto-san. Thank you. For the ride, and for... everything your family has done. Watching the house. I know it wasn't required."

Takeshi waved the thanks away again, but his eyes were kind. "Your grandmother Hana helped my mother when times were hard. We remember such things." He reached across the cab and gripped Sheldon's shoulder briefly—a firm pressure, warm and surprisingly strong. "Welcome home, Tsukino-san. Come find me if you need anything. My farm is the one with the persimmon orchard, east side of the village. Anyone can show you."

Sheldon climbed out of the truck, his feet finding solid ground, his body still tired but his mind more settled than it had been since waking in the chrysanthemum field. He had a direction now. A place to go, people who expected him, a story that had already begun to tell itself through the connections his benefactor had woven into being.

"Thank you," he said again, and closed the door.

The truck pulled away, rattling back toward wherever Yamamoto Takeshi kept his persimmons and his memories of a girl named Yuki who had laughed a lot before she left for America. Sheldon watched until it disappeared around a curve, then turned to face the narrow path between the stone walls.

Three hundred meters to a house that had been waiting.

He started walking.
