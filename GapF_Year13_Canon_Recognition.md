# GAP F: YEAR 13 (2001) — CANON RECOGNITION
## Son of Cosmos: The Awakening Year
## December 29, 2025

---

# OVERVIEW

Year 13 is when everything changes. Ryoko awakens, canon events begin, and Sheldon finally realizes what universe he's been living in for twelve years.

**Timeline Context:**
- Year 13 = April 2001 - March 2002
- Tenchi is 16-17 (High School 2nd Year)
- Sheldon has been at the shrine for 12 years
- Memory fog has obscured his anime knowledge since arrival

---

# PART 1: THE MEMORY FOG

## 1.1 — What Sheldon Remembered (Years 1-12)

Cosmos granted Sheldon a partial memory fog regarding his meta-knowledge. This was protective — knowing too much would have:
- Made integration impossible (too many secrets)
- Created unbearable dramatic irony
- Potentially changed canon events
- Prevented genuine relationship-building

**What Sheldon KNEW he knew:**
- He died in his previous life
- He was a physicist
- Someone gave him this second chance
- He had abilities he didn't understand
- He was in "some kind of situation" (vague sense)

**What Sheldon COULDN'T access:**
- Which anime (if any)
- Character names
- Plot events
- Who was sealed in the cave
- What was coming

## 1.2 — Memory Fog Behavior (Years 1-12)

| Year | Fog Status | Incidents |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 1-3 | Complete | No recognition; fully immersed in "reality" |
| 4-6 | Stirring | Occasional déjà vu; dismissed |
| 7-9 | Thinning | "Ryoko" surfaces as a word; no context |
| 10-11 | Fragmenting | Dreams of cyan hair; filed and forgotten |
| 12 | Cracking | Strong sense "something is sealed" near lake |

**Year 12 Specifics:**

During Year 12, Sheldon experienced:
- Increased awareness around the lake
- The name "Ryoko" surfacing repeatedly
- A feeling of recognition he couldn't place
- Dreams featuring a woman with wild cyan hair
- Yosho's increasingly pointed comments about "what's beneath"

He filed these sensations away. The fog held. Barely.

---

# PART 2: THE AWAKENING (Summer 2001)

## 2.1 — Setup

**The Day:**
A summer day, Year 13. Tenchi is 17. Sheldon is doing routine maintenance when he feels something shift.

**What Sheldon Experiences:**
- A pulse from the direction of the lake
- The air changes — pressure, temperature, something
- His enhanced senses flood with input
- And then—

A scream. Energy. Destruction.

Tenchi has released Ryoko.

## 2.2 — The Recognition Moment

Sheldon runs toward the disturbance. What he sees:

- A woman floating in the air
- Cyan hair, wild and untamed
- Energy crackling around her
- Tenchi on the ground, terrified
- The cave entrance, blown open

And the memory fog SHATTERS.

**The Inner Monologue:**

*Cyan hair. Gold eyes. The demon sealed by Yosho seven hundred years ago.*

*Ryoko.*

*Oh.*

*Oh no.*

*Oh no no no no—*

*I'm in Tenchi Muyo.*

*I've BEEN in Tenchi Muyo.*

*For twelve years.*

*I've been living in a harem anime for twelve YEARS.*

## 2.3 — What Floods Back

In the moment of recognition, everything returns:

| Memory | Status |
|--------|--------|
| The anime exists | REMEMBERED |
| Basic premise | REMEMBERED |
| Character names (Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Washu, Mihoshi) | REMEMBERED |
| General plot beats | FRAGMENTARY |
| Specific episode details | LOST (he dropped the show) |
| How it ends | UNKNOWN (never finished watching) |

**Critical:** Sheldon watched Tenchi Muyo in his previous life but didn't finish it. He dropped it partway through. His meta-knowledge is INCOMPLETE.

## 2.4 — The Harem Realization

The second wave of horror:

*Wait.*

*This is a HAREM anime.*

*Multiple women are going to arrive.*

*And they're all going to be interested in—*

He looks at Tenchi. Seventeen years old. The boy he raised.

*No.*

*Absolutely not.*

*Not on my watch.*

---

# PART 3: IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH

## 3.1 — The First Hours

**Sheldon's Priorities:**
1. Ensure Tenchi is physically safe
2. Assess the "threat" (Ryoko)
3. Don't reveal meta-knowledge
4. Support Yosho

**What Actually Happens:**

Ryoko, freshly awakened after 700 years, encounters:
- Not an isolated teenage boy
- But an established household
- With a calm, competent adult (Sheldon)
- Who isn't afraid of her
- And who treats her like a person, not a monster

This is NOT how canon goes.

## 3.2 — Sheldon's Assessment

**What he remembers about Ryoko:**
- She was controlled (not evil by choice)
- She becomes family eventually
- She's lonely
- She loves Tenchi (in canon)

**What he decides:**
- She's not a threat (probably)
- She needs integration, not combat
- The "harem" dynamic can be redirected
- He will NOT let this become a romantic free-for-all

## 3.3 — The First Conversation

That evening, after the initial chaos settles:

**Setting:** The shrine porch. Yosho, Sheldon, and Ryoko.

**Yosho:** Treats her with wary respect (he sealed her; he knows what she is)

**Sheldon:** Offers tea. Asks if she's hungry. Treats her like a person.

**Ryoko:** Confused. This isn't what she expected. Where's the fear? The hostility?

**Sheldon's Internal:** *She's been sealed for seven hundred years. She's confused and scared and covering it with bravado. I've seen this behavior before. She needs a home, not a fight.*

# PART 4: WHAT SHELDON NOW KNOWS

## 4.1 — Meta-Knowledge Inventory

| Topic | Knowledge Level | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **Ryoko** | MODERATE | Space pirate, Washu's daughter, controlled by Kagato |
| **Ayeka** | BASIC | Juraian princess, coming for Yosho |
| **Sasami** | BASIC | Younger sister, connected to Tsunami |
| **Washu** | MODERATE | Greatest scientist, sealed in gems, Ryoko's creator |
| **Mihoshi** | BASIC | Galaxy Police, clumsy, lucky |
| **Kagato** | MODERATE | Big villain, coming eventually |
| **Yosho's identity** | CONFIRMED | Already knew from Year 4+; now understands context |
| **Light Hawk Wings** | BASIC | Important power system |
| **How series ends** | UNKNOWN | Never finished watching |

## 4.2 — What Sheldon Does NOT Know

Despite the fog lifting:

| Topic | Status |
|-------|--------|
| OVA 3-5 events | Never watched |
| Z arc | Unknown |
| Noike | Unknown |
| Tenchi's ultimate destiny | Vague at best |
| His own role in the story | Completely unknown |
| Why Cosmos put him HERE | Still uncertain |

## 4.3 — The Cosmos Question

Now that he knows where he is, Sheldon wonders:

*Did she KNOW this was Tenchi Muyo?*

*Did she put me in a harem anime ON PURPOSE?*

*Or did she just see "peaceful, safe universe" and not check the... genre?*

This becomes material for a future dream-conversation with Cosmos.

# PART 5: TRANSFORMING THE DYNAMIC

## 5.1 — The "Aunt" Strategy

Sheldon's plan, formed in the first 48 hours:

**Problem:** Canon has women arriving as romantic interests for Tenchi
**Solution:** Establish them as FAMILY instead

**Method:**
- Be the stable adult presence
- Treat arrivals as guests, then residents, then family
- Model healthy adult relationships (him + Yosho)
- Give Tenchi emotional support so he doesn't need romantic validation
- Redirect "romantic rival" energy into "found family" dynamics

## 5.2 — Why It Works

Canon Tenchi was:
- Raised by absent father and elderly grandfather
- Emotionally isolated
- Desperate for connection
- Overwhelmed by female attention

Story Tenchi is:
- Raised by devoted father figure (Sheldon) and grandfather
- Emotionally secure
- Knows what healthy love looks like
- Not desperate; can choose deliberately

The harem dynamic CANNOT form because Tenchi doesn't need it.

## 5.3 — The "Aunt" Implementation

| Character | Canon Role | Story Role | How Sheldon Enables |
|-----------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Ryoko** | Romantic interest, aggressive | Chaotic aunt, protective | Gives her a home; respects her |
| **Ayeka** | Romantic rival to Ryoko | Dignified aunt, political | Treats her as equal; gives her purpose |
| **Sasami** | Little sister figure | Beloved niece, apprentice cook | Teaches her; values her |
| **Mihoshi** | Comedic love interest | Cheerful aunt, family member | Includes her; doesn't dismiss her |
| **Washu** | Chaotic scientist | Eccentric aunt, ally | Respects her intellect; earns her respect |

# PART 7: SHELDON'S POSITION (END OF YEAR 13)

## 7.1 — Status Summary

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Role** | Household stabilizer; emotional anchor |
| **Meta-knowledge** | Fog lifted; incomplete knowledge |
| **Powers** | Phase III — 1-3 LHW in crisis only |
| **Relationship** | Yosho: "I don't know what I'd do without you" |
| **Family** | Father figure to Tenchi; establishing aunts |

## 7.2 — Internal State

**Relieved:** Finally understands where he is
**Anxious:** Knows threats are coming (Kagato)
**Determined:** Will protect this family
**Uncertain:** Doesn't know how the story ends
**Grateful:** Has a purpose now

## 7.3 — What He Hides

Even now, Sheldon doesn't reveal:
- His meta-knowledge to ANYONE (including Yosho)
- That he knows what's coming
- That he's actively shaping events
- His cosmic nature (still doesn't fully understand it)

**Why:** He learned in Year 4 that selective truth works. Full disclosure would change how everyone treats him. He wants to be family, not oracle.

# PART 8: SCENE SEEDS

## 8.1 — Critical Scenes (Year 13)

| Scene | Setting | Core |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Memory Shatter** | Shrine grounds, Ryoko's emergence | Recognition; horror; acceptance |
| **First Tea with Ryoko** | Shrine porch, evening | Humanizing the "demon" |
| **"Aunts" Strategy** | With Yosho, private | Explaining his approach |
| **Ayeka's Arrival** | Shrine entrance | Diplomatic greeting, not conflict |
| **Household Chaos** | Dinner, four+ women | Comedy; warmth; found family |
| **Late Night Processing** | Sheldon alone | Processing meta-knowledge |

## 8.2 — Dialogue Seeds

**Sheldon to Ryoko (first night):**
> "You've been asleep for seven hundred years. You must be hungry. I'll make something."

**Sheldon to Yosho (private):**
> "They're not here for Tenchi. They're here for YOU. And for family they didn't know they needed."

**Sheldon internal (processing):**
> *Twelve years. Twelve years of daily life, and I never once thought 'wait, is this Tenchi Muyo?' The fog was... thorough.*

**Ryoko to Sheldon (confused):**
> "You're not afraid of me. Why aren't you afraid of me?"

**Sheldon to Ryoko:**
> "Should I be? You haven't done anything to me. You're just... a woman who's been alone for a very long time."

# PART 9: COSMOS DREAM (END OF YEAR 13)

## 9.1 — The Conversation

Near the end of Year 13, Sheldon has a dream-communication with Cosmos.

**Setting:** The dream-space; silver light; her presence

**Sheldon:** "You put me in a harem anime."

**Cosmos:** *silence*

**Sheldon:** "Did you KNOW?"

**Cosmos:** "I examined the metaphysical architecture. Stability. Healing potential. Growth opportunity."

**Sheldon:** "You didn't check the genre."

**Cosmos:** "...The genre?"

**Sheldon:** "Romantic entanglement traffic jams. Multiple women competing for one protagonist. Harems."

**Cosmos:** *distressed silence* "I did not... check for harem metrics."

**Sheldon:** "You put me in a soap opera gravity well. By accident."

**Cosmos:** "...You seem to be handling it well."

**Sheldon:** "I'm turning them into AUNTS."

**Cosmos:** *something like approval* "That is very much something I would do."

## 9.2 — What This Reveals

- Cosmos genuinely didn't know about the harem elements
- She chose this universe for other reasons (stability, healing)
- She approves of Sheldon's solution
- She's watching, but not interfering
- The "aunt" dynamic is cosmically endorsed

---

# PART 10: RYOKO'S 12-YEAR OBSERVATION

## 10.1 — What Canon Doesn't Show

**Critical Detail:** Ryoko was sealed but CONSCIOUS. Her astral form could observe.

For twelve years, Ryoko watched:
- Sheldon arrive at the shrine
- A stranger climb 320 steps
- Yosho accept him
- Tenchi grow from 4 to 16
- Daily life unfold above her prison

## 10.2 — What This Means

When Ryoko emerges, she ALREADY KNOWS Sheldon:
- She's watched him cook for Tenchi
- She's seen him care for the shrine
- She's observed his relationship with Yosho
- She knows he's not afraid of the supernatural
- She's been lonely, watching a family she couldn't join

**Her Confusion:** She expected fear. She expected hostility. She expected to be a monster.

What she got: "You must be hungry. I'll make something."

Twelve years of observation didn't prepare her for being treated like a person.

# PART 11: TRANSITION TO YEARS 14+

## 11.1 — What Year 13 Establishes

By the end of Year 13:
- ✅ Ryoko integrated (chaotic aunt)
- ✅ Ayeka/Sasami integrated (dignified aunt + niece)
- ✅ Mihoshi integrated (cheerful aunt)
- ✅ "Aunt" dynamic solidified
- ✅ Meta-knowledge processed
- ✅ Family structure stable
- ✅ Ready for canon threats

## 11.2 — What's Coming (Years 14-18)

| Year | Canon Event | Sheldon's Knowledge |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| 14 | Kagato; Washu's release | KNOWS Kagato is threat |
| 15 | Dr. Clay; Zero | VAGUE memory |
| 16-17 | Tokimi; Z arc | UNKNOWN |
| 18 | Canon completion | UNKNOWN |

Sheldon knows SOME of this. Not all. He'll adapt as it comes.
