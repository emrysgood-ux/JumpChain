# SON OF COSMOS: YEAR 1 EXPANSION METHODOLOGY
## Version 1.0 - Scene Density Production Framework

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document codifies the methodology for producing 299+ scenes per character per day across the Year 1 expansion (April 3, 1989 - April 3, 1990). The approach balances production speed with narrative quality, worldbuilding generation, and canon compliance.

**Scale:**
- 365 days
- 3-4 POV characters per day
- 299 scenes minimum per character per day
- Target: ~400,000+ scenes, ~80-100 million words

---

# PART 1: SCENE ARCHITECTURE

## 1.1 Scene Definition

A **scene** in this framework is:
- A discrete narrative unit with specific timestamp
- 80-150 words average (expandable to 200-300 for high-impact moments)
- Single location or clear location transition
- One primary action, observation, or internal moment
- Tagged by type for distribution tracking

## 1.2 Scene Type Distribution (Per 299 Scenes)

| Type | Count | Percentage | Purpose |
|------|-------|------------|---------|
| Main Plot | 100 | 33.4% | Core story advancement |
| Subplot | 80 | 26.8% | Secondary threads, foreshadowing |
| Character Development | 50 | 16.7% | Internal growth, psychology |
| Relationship | 40 | 13.4% | Interpersonal dynamics |
| Worldbuilding | 20 | 6.7% | Environment, culture, lore |
| Transition/Bridge | 9 | 3.0% | Scene connections, time passage |

## 1.3 Time Block Distribution

A character's waking day (~17 hours) divides into blocks:

| Time Block | Hours | Scene Target | Focus |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------|
| Pre-Dawn (04:30-06:00) | 1.5 | 18-25 | Waking, preparation, solitude |
| Morning (06:00-08:00) | 2 | 24-30 | Breakfast, household activity |
| Late Morning (08:00-12:00) | 4 | 48-60 | Primary work/activity |
| Midday (12:00-13:00) | 1 | 12-15 | Lunch, rest, transition |
| Afternoon (13:00-17:00) | 4 | 48-60 | Secondary work/activity |
| Evening (17:00-19:00) | 2 | 24-30 | Dinner preparation, family time |
| Night (19:00-22:00) | 3 | 36-45 | Evening activities, wind-down |
| Internal/Reflection | — | 50-95 | Distributed throughout day |

**Note:** Internal/Reflection scenes are interspersed, not a separate time block.

---

# PART 2: BATCH PRODUCTION SYSTEM

## 2.1 Batch Structure

Each POV character's day divides into **6 batches**:

| Batch | Scenes | Time Coverage | Word Target |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | 001-050 | 05:00-10:00 | 4,000-5,000 |
| 2 | 051-100 | 10:00-12:30 | 4,000-5,000 |
| 3 | 101-150 | 12:30-16:00 | 4,000-5,000 |
| 4 | 151-200 | 16:00-19:30 | 4,000-5,000 |
| 5 | 201-250 | 19:30-22:00 | 4,000-5,000 |
| 6 | 251-299 | Internal/Reflection | 4,000-5,000 |

**Total per character per day:** ~24,000-30,000 words

## 2.2 Batch Header Template

# PART 4: WORLDBUILDING GENERATION

## 4.1 Mandatory Generation Per Day

Each day's expansion MUST generate:

| Category | Minimum | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| New NPCs | 3-5 | Village shopkeepers, shrine visitors, school staff |
| Location Details | 2-3 | Room layouts, path descriptions, shop interiors |
| Cultural Elements | 1-2 | Customs, festivals, daily practices |
| Plot Threads | 2-3 | Mysteries, foreshadowing, character questions |
| Canon Anchors | 1+ | References to locked timeline events |

## 4.2 NPC Generation Protocol

**When introducing a new NPC:**
1. Full name (family name + given name)
2. Role/occupation
3. Relationship to existing characters
4. One distinguishing characteristic
5. Potential for future scenes

**NPC Stub Template:**
```markdown
### [FAMILY NAME] [GIVEN NAME]
- **Role:** [occupation/position]
- **Relation:** [connection to main characters]
- **Trait:** [distinguishing characteristic]
- **Location:** [where they're usually found]
- **Introduced:** Day [X], Scene [XXX]
```

## 4.3 Location Generation Protocol

**When detailing a new location:**
1. Physical dimensions/layout
2. Sensory details (smell, sound, texture)
3. Historical/cultural significance
4. Relationship to other locations
5. Seasonal variations (if applicable)

## 4.4 Worldbuilding Integration

Worldbuilding emerges through:
- Character observation (Sheldon notices details)
- Character interaction (NPCs share information)
- Task requirements (work reveals how things function)
- Cultural participation (meals, rituals, customs)

**NOT through:**
- Exposition dumps
- Narrator explanations
- Character lectures

# PART 6: QUALITY CONTROL

## 6.1 Pre-Batch Checklist

Before writing each batch:
- [ ] Verify current day/date/weekday
- [ ] Check character's previous batch ending state
- [ ] Review any cross-POV scenes needed
- [ ] Confirm no forbidden words in outline
- [ ] Note any locked canon events for this date

## 6.2 Post-Batch Checklist

After completing each batch:
- [ ] Scene count verified (50 for Batches 1-5, 49 for Batch 6)
- [ ] Timestamps progress logically
- [ ] No forbidden words present
- [ ] Worldbuilding elements documented
- [ ] Plot threads noted
- [ ] New NPCs stubbed

## 6.3 Forbidden Word Audit

Run grep pattern after each batch:
```bash
grep -iE "(cosmos|sailor|ryoko|washu|tsunami|kagato|ayeka|sasami|jurai|lambda|phase [IVX]+|remade|benefactor|jumpchain|perk|celestial|grimoire|forge)" [filename]
```

## 6.4 Cross-POV Consistency

When the same event appears in multiple POVs:
- Timestamps must align
- Physical actions must match
- Dialogue must be consistent
- Perceptions may differ (each POV interprets differently)

---

# PART 7: EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS

## 7.1 Scene Clustering

Group related scenes to maintain flow:
- Physical activity clusters (working on same task)
- Conversation clusters (multi-scene dialogues)
- Transition clusters (moving between locations)
- Reflection clusters (internal processing)

## 7.2 Parallel Development

While writing one POV:
- Note scenes that overlap with other POVs
- Mark timestamps for cross-reference
- Flag shared dialogue for consistency check

## 7.3 Batch Production Targets

**Optimal pace:** 1 batch per 15-20 minutes
**Day completion (single POV):** 90-120 minutes
**Day completion (all POVs):** 6-8 hours

## 7.4 Story Bible Integration Points

Update Story Bible after:
- Each new NPC introduction
- Each new location detail
- Each power manifestation
- Each relationship development
- Each canon reference

# PART 9: COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

## 9.1 Scene Density Drift

**Problem:** Scenes become too long, reducing count
**Solution:** Split into multiple scenes; each action = new scene

## 9.2 Forbidden Word Slip

**Problem:** Meta-knowledge terms appear in Sheldon POV
**Solution:** Pre-write, then grep audit, then publish

## 9.3 Timeline Inconsistency

**Problem:** Events don't align across POVs
**Solution:** Use timestamp grid before writing; mark shared moments

## 9.4 Worldbuilding Stagnation

**Problem:** Same locations/NPCs repeatedly without expansion
**Solution:** Mandate 3-5 new elements per day minimum

## 9.5 Voice Bleed

**Problem:** All POVs sound similar
**Solution:** Review voice markers before each POV switch
