## FORBIDDEN WORDS IN SHELDON POV (Phase I)

These words **MUST NEVER** appear in Sheldon's perspective during Book 1:

```
Cosmos, Sailor, Sailor Cosmos, Lambda
Jurai, Juraian, Galaxy Police
Ryoko, Washu, Tsunami, Kagato, Ayeka, Sasami
Royal Tree, Phase I/II/III
"remade," "created," "reborn"
```

### Test Every Thought
Before writing any Sheldon interiority, ask: **"Has he learned this on-page?"**

---

## KNOWLEDGE STATES

### What Sheldon KNOWS:
- He died (Alaska, cascade failure, Maria Chen's face)
- His body is different (no scars, younger, restored)
- Documents say he is Tsukino Sheldon
- Japanese language is fluent (surprise to him)
- Family backstory per documents/letter
- He has some kind of power (Day 1 test)
- Power exhausts him completely when used

### What Sheldon DOES NOT KNOW:
- Anything about Tenchi Muyo universe
- Katsuhito's true nature (700+ year old Juraian prince)
- What's in the cave (Ryoko, sealed)
- Why he's here
- Who sent him
- That it's Sailor Cosmos
- The significance of the name "Tsukino"

## SAFE REFERENCES FOR SHELDON

Sheldon can reference his benefactor as:
- "the system"
- "the presence"  
- "his benefactor"
- "whatever brought him here"
- "the warmth" (the between-space memory)
- "wings" (vague memory, no name attached)

**NEVER by name. NEVER with specificity.**

- KNOWS: His full history, Yosho identity, what Funaho senses, shrine secrets
- CAN REFERENCE: Jurai, trees, his past
- OBSERVES: Sheldon's strangeness, the "settling" effect

### Tenchi Masaki (Age 4-5)

## MULTI-POV PROTOCOL

When using multiple perspectives on the same scene:
1. Use **CHRONOLOGICAL INTERLEAVING** (Law 36 Decision)
2. Each POV header clearly marked (e.g., "KATSUHITO POV")
3. POV sections alternate in timeline order
4. No information leakage between perspectives
