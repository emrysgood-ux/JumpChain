# TSUKINO FAMILY — COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
## CORRECTED VERSION v3 — January 10, 2026
### Son of Cosmos: JumpChain

---

## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

**Cosmos didn't create a cover story. She rewrote causality.**

The Tsukino family GENUINELY EXISTS. Records exist. People remember them. Sheldon is genuinely their relative—because Cosmos made it so.

The family name "Tsukino" (月野, "moon field") deliberately echoes Usagi Tsukino's family. Cosmos created a mother for Sheldon by drawing on her own.

---

## KEY FAMILY LOGIC

- **Mother = Yuki Tsukino** (Japanese, born into the Tsukino family)
- **First Husband = Takeo Chiba** (died young; Yuki reverted to maiden name)
- **Second Husband = James Carter** (American, Black serviceman from Georgia)
- This explains Sheldon's Black American identity AND his Japanese family connection
- Property inheritance flows through his MOTHER's birth family
