## Story Summary

### The Premise
Sheldon Carter, a Black American physicist with four PhDs, dies in a particle accelerator accident in 2025. He awakens in rural Japan in 1989, in a new body with a new identity: Sheldon Tsukino. With no memory of how he arrived and only a wallet full of yen and convincing documentation, he finds his way to Masaki Shrine — where an elderly priest offers him a place to stay.

### The Core
This is a **found family story**. Over the next 12 years, Sheldon becomes integral to the Masaki household: helping raise young Tenchi, assisting with shrine maintenance, and discovering that his cooking seems to carry something special — a warmth that heals more than hunger.

What Sheldon doesn't know is that he's been placed here by Sailor Cosmos, an eternal guardian who healed his dying star seed and accidentally formed a mother-son bond with him. What he also doesn't know is that the elderly priest is actually a 700-year-old Juraian prince, and that a space pirate is sealed in the cave he's been warned away from.

### The Promise
When Tenchi accidentally releases Ryoko in Year 13, the quiet life Sheldon has built will be shattered — but the family he's become part of will face the cosmic chaos together.
