The darkness held a different quality here.

Sheldon's eyes opened to absolute black—no streetlights bleeding through curtains, no LED displays casting their perpetual glow, no distant highway painting orange across the ceiling. Just darkness, complete and rural, broken only by the thin line of grey where the shutter didn't quite meet the frame.

For three heartbeats, he didn't know where he was.

The futon beneath him felt wrong. Too firm. The blanket too heavy. The air carried scents that didn't belong to any place he remembered—cedar and old smoke and something green, something alive. His body tensed, adrenaline flooding through muscles that responded with unfamiliar speed, and he sat up in the darkness with his heart hammering against ribs that felt too prominent, too defined.

Then memory crashed over him like a wave.

The field. The flowers. The wallet full of documents bearing his face and a name that was his and wasn't. The shrine. The old man with knowing eyes. The child who had grabbed his hand like claiming territory.

Not a dream. Still not a dream.

Sheldon let out a slow breath and pressed his palms against his eyes until colors bloomed in the darkness. Twenty-four hours. He had been in this new existence for approximately twenty-four hours, and he had already managed to exhaust himself testing abilities he didn't understand, accept hospitality from strangers, and promise a four-year-old that he would learn to carve wooden blocks.

The absurdity of it threatened to bubble up as laughter. He pressed it down.

His grandmother's voice echoed across decades: *The morning finds you where it finds you. What matters is what you do with the hours God gives.*

She had always been up before dawn. Biscuits in the oven by five-thirty, coffee perking on the stove, the kitchen warm and bright while the Georgia darkness pressed against the windows. He had inherited her internal clock, much to his past self's annoyance—his body had never quite accepted the concept of sleeping in, no matter how late the lab work ran.

Apparently that particular trait had survived whatever transformation had brought him here.

He pushed back the heavy blanket and stood in the darkness, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The tatami mats were cool beneath his feet, the texture precise and unfamiliar. His clothes from yesterday—the trousers and button-down shirt that had appeared on his new body—hung from a hook near the door. The small bag of supplies from Haruna's store sat in the corner: toothbrush, soap, the simple necessities of a life starting from nothing.

Grey light was seeping more strongly through the shutter gap now. He crossed to the window and eased the wooden panel open an inch, then two.

The world outside was suspended between night and day. The shrine courtyard lay in shadow, but the sky above the trees had begun to lighten, deep blue giving way to something softer at the eastern edge. Mist hung low over the ground, pooling in the spaces between buildings, wrapping around the base of the great tree like offerings of gauze. No birds yet—too early even for them—but the silence felt expectant, waiting.

The great tree dominated the view. Even in this half-light, its presence was undeniable. The trunk rose like a pillar holding up the sky, its branches spreading in patterns that seemed almost architectural, almost *designed*. Sheldon found his eyes drawn to it the way they might be drawn to a beautiful equation—something in its proportions spoke of underlying order, of mathematics made manifest in bark and leaf.

He remembered the feeling from yesterday. Standing at its base, looking up, something had stirred in the air around him. Or in him. He still couldn't tell which.

Not today. He wasn't ready to test anything today.

He closed the shutter quietly and turned back to the room. In the growing light, details emerged that he hadn't noticed the night before: the grain of the wooden ceiling beams, worn smooth by centuries; the faint pattern on the fusuma door, cranes and clouds rendered in pale ink; the small alcove in the corner where a simple scroll hung, characters he could read but didn't yet understand.

*Patience*, the scroll said. Or perhaps *endurance*. The character could mean either.

Movement somewhere in the house. A soft footfall, the whisper of fabric, the distant sound of water running. Someone else was awake.

Sheldon gathered his few belongings and moved toward the door. His hand found the edge of the fusuma, and he slid it open as quietly as he could manage.

The door announced him anyway.

The squeak was exactly as he remembered from the night before—a high, sustained note that seemed designed to carry through the entire building. He winced, freezing in place, but there was nothing to be done about it now. If he'd hoped to move through the morning unobserved, that hope had just died.

The hallway stretched in both directions, the same dark wood and tatami that characterized his room. To the left, he remembered, lay the main living areas—the kitchen, the room where they had eaten dinner. To the right, the hallway turned toward what he assumed were other sleeping quarters.

The sounds were coming from the left. Kitchen sounds: the soft clatter of a pot being placed on a burner, the hiss of a flame catching, the rhythmic scrape of something being stirred.

He moved toward them, his feet finding the path along the edge of the hallway where the floor was most solid and least likely to creak. Another of his grandmother's lessons: houses have their own languages, and a polite guest learns to move quietly.

The kitchen door was open, warm light spilling into the hallway. The smell of rice already cooking, the earthy scent of miso being prepared.

Sheldon paused at the threshold.

Rea stood at the counter with her back to him, her dark hair pulled up in a simple knot, her movements efficient and practiced. She wore a plain apron over clothes he hadn't seen yesterday—simpler, more suited to work. The kitchen around her was already organized for the morning's meal: ingredients laid out in precise arrangement, utensils within easy reach, everything in its proper place.

She had heard the door squeak. He was certain of it. Yet she didn't turn, didn't acknowledge his presence—just continued her work as though the morning were hers alone.

He cleared his throat softly.

"Good morning," he said.

Her hands paused for just a moment. Then she turned, and her expression was perfectly composed—polite, distant, giving nothing away.

"You're awake early, Tsukino-san."

"Habit," he said. "My grandmother believed in early mornings."

Something flickered across her face at that—interest, perhaps, or recognition. "The bathroom is at the end of the hall, on the right. There are towels in the cabinet beside the door." She turned back to her work. "Breakfast will be ready in forty minutes."

It was a dismissal, courteously phrased. She had her routine; he was not yet part of it.

"Thank you," Sheldon said. He lingered a moment longer, watching the precise way she measured miso into the pot, the economy of her movements. Then he turned and walked toward the bathroom.

Behind him, the sounds of breakfast preparation continued—the domestic symphony of a household waking to meet the day.

# Scene 2.2: Morning Routines

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 06:15 - 07:00
**Location:** Bathroom → Kitchen
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 1,500

The bathroom was small and immaculately clean.

Sheldon stood in the doorway for a moment, taking in the details. A deep wooden tub dominated one corner, currently empty and dry, clearly meant for evening soaking rather than morning ablutions. Beside it, a low stool sat before a hand-held showerhead mounted at knee height—the traditional arrangement for washing before entering the bath. A simple sink occupied the opposite wall, and a mirror hung above it, slightly fogged from the humidity that seemed to cling to everything in this climate.

He found the towels where Rea had indicated, neatly folded in a cabinet that smelled of cedar. He took one—pale blue, slightly worn but clean—and set it on the small shelf beside the sink.

The face in the mirror still surprised him.

Thirty years old. He kept forgetting that. His old face had carried the accumulated evidence of time—the deeper lines around his eyes that had arrived with his late thirties, the grey threading through his temples that had started appearing after his mother's death. This face was smoother, younger, belonging to a version of himself he remembered only in photographs.

The eyes were the same, though. Dark brown, almost black in certain lights, set beneath brows that had always been too heavy for his face. His grandmother had called them "thinking eyes"—said they looked like they were always calculating something, even when he was a child. *That boy's gonna be a professor or a preacher*, she'd told his mother. *Either way, he's gonna spend his life studying things most folks don't even see.*

She'd been half right.

He turned on the tap and splashed cold water on his face, letting the shock of it drive away the last traces of sleep. The toothbrush from Haruna's store was basic but functional, and the soap had a faint herbal scent that was already becoming familiar. He worked through the morning routine methodically, finding comfort in the small rituals that were the same regardless of which world he woke up in.

By the time he finished, the grey light seeping through the bathroom's small window had strengthened to pale gold. The sun was properly up now, and the sounds of the household had shifted—more movement in the kitchen, the distant clatter of dishes being set out.

He dressed in yesterday's clothes. There was no help for it; the supplies from Haruna had covered toiletries but not a full wardrobe. Katsuhito had mentioned something about spare clothing, items left by visitors over the years, but Sheldon hadn't wanted to impose further on his first night. Today, perhaps, he could address the practical matters of building a life from nothing.

The kitchen, when he returned to it, had transformed.

Where before Rea had worked alone in the pre-dawn quiet, now the room hummed with controlled activity. Steam rose from multiple pots, the rice cooker released its characteristic click as it shifted from cooking to warming mode, and the smell of miso had deepened and enriched. Small dishes were arranged on the counter in precise formation—pickled vegetables, what looked like grilled fish, a small bowl of something he didn't recognize.

Rea moved through this orchestrated chaos with the ease of long practice. She didn't look up when he entered, but she spoke without pausing in her work.

"Tea is on the table. Masaki-sama will be down shortly."

The table in question was low, set in the adjoining room that served as the dining area. A cushion had been placed on one side—his position from last night, apparently now assigned—and a steaming cup of green tea waited beside it.

Sheldon knelt and took the cup in both hands, letting the warmth seep into his palms. The tea was properly hot, steeped to a pale jade green, with that particular grassy sweetness that marked good sencha. His grandmother had drunk Lipton from a teabag; this was something else entirely.

"The tea is excellent," he said. "Thank you."

A pause in the kitchen sounds. Then: "Masaki-sama prefers it strong. If it's too bitter, there is hot water to add."

"It's perfect."

Another pause, longer this time. He heard her resume her work, but something in the quality of the silence had shifted. A small acknowledgment, perhaps. A point scored in whatever evaluation she was conducting.

Minutes passed. The tea warmed him from the inside, and the sounds of breakfast preparation settled into a comfortable rhythm. Through the window, he could see the courtyard brightening as the sun climbed higher, the mist burning away to reveal the clean lines of the shrine buildings.

Footsteps in the hallway—heavier than Rea's, measured and deliberate. Katsuhito appeared in the doorway, dressed in simple hakama and a plain work shirt, his white hair still slightly damp from his own morning ablutions.

"Tsukino-san." He inclined his head. "You slept well, I hope."

"Well enough. The room is very comfortable."

"It is simple, but adequate." Katsuhito moved to take his own position at the table, settling into seiza with the fluid ease of someone who had spent decades in that posture. "Rea tells me you were awake early."

"The door gave me away."

A slight smile creased Katsuhito's weathered face. "It has done so for many years. I have never fixed it." He accepted the tea that Rea brought him with a small nod of thanks. "Some sounds are worth keeping."

Sheldon considered that. A warning system, perhaps. Or simply a preference for knowing when the household was in motion. Either way, it was a small piece of data about the man across from him—someone who valued awareness, who preferred to know when things were moving.

"You mentioned clothing last night," Sheldon said. "I apologize for the imposition, but I find myself in need."

"There is no imposition. We keep things for guests. After breakfast, I will show you." Katsuhito sipped his tea, watching Sheldon over the rim of the cup. "You have plans for today?"

"I should see to the house. Assess what repairs are needed, what can wait and what cannot."

"The roof, certainly. Tanaka-san in the village does good work. I can arrange an introduction."

"I would appreciate that."

"There are other things as well. The garden will need attention before the growing season advances too far. The well should be tested—it has been some years since the house was occupied."

"You know the property well."

"I knew your aunt." Katsuhito's eyes were steady, revealing nothing. "Michiko-san was a good neighbor. She would want the house cared for."

The statement hung in the air between them, weighted with implications that Sheldon couldn't quite parse. Michiko—the aunt he had never met, whose existence was documented in the papers in his wallet, whose house he had supposedly inherited. In Katsuhito's telling, she was real, a person with history and presence and relationships. Not a convenient fiction created by whatever power had placed him here.

But then, perhaps she had been real. Perhaps the life documented in his wallet had actually happened, somewhere, to someone. Perhaps he was stepping into the space left by a real Sheldon Tsukino, one who had grown up with a mother named Yuki and a grandmother who made biscuits before dawn.

The thought was vertiginous. He set it aside for later examination.

"I hope to honor her memory," he said carefully.

Katsuhito nodded, something shifting in his expression—approval, perhaps, or simply acknowledgment. "That is a worthy goal."

From the kitchen, Rea's voice: "Breakfast is ready."

They rose together, and the morning meal began.

# Scene 2.3: First Breakfast

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 07:00 - 07:45
**Location:** Dining area
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon primary, Tenchi secondary)
**Word Target:** 2,000

---

### SHELDON

Breakfast was simple and precisely arranged.

Rice in individual bowls, still steaming. Miso soup in lacquered cups, the surface broken by cubes of tofu and ribbons of wakame. Grilled fish—small and whole, the kind meant to be eaten bones and all—laid out on rectangular plates. Pickled vegetables in small dishes: pale yellow takuan, pink-tinged ginger, something dark and fermented that Sheldon didn't recognize. A small dish of what appeared to be fermented soybeans occupied one corner of the arrangement, and Sheldon made a mental note to approach that one cautiously.

Katsuhito ate with the focused efficiency of someone for whom meals were fuel rather than occasion. His chopsticks moved in precise arcs, selecting bites with mathematical regularity, pausing only to sip tea or respond to conversation.

Rea did not join them at the table. She moved between kitchen and dining area, bringing additional items, refilling tea, anticipating needs before they were voiced. When Sheldon caught her eye and gestured toward the empty space at the table, she shook her head almost imperceptibly and continued her work.

The silence was not uncomfortable, but it was weighty. Sheldon had the sense of being observed, measured, slotted into categories he couldn't see. Every bite he took, every choice of which dish to address next, was being noted and filed away.

He was halfway through his rice when the sound came.

Rapid footsteps in the hallway, lighter than either Katsuhito's or Rea's measured tread. A small voice calling out something indistinct. Then the shoji slid open with more force than precision, and Tenchi burst into the room like a small contained explosion.

---

### TENCHI

Tenchi had been awake for *ages*.

He'd woken up when it was still dark, which was terrible and wrong because mornings weren't supposed to be dark, but then he'd remembered: the man was here. The tall man with the strange name and the sad eyes who had held his hand yesterday and hadn't let go even when Tenchi had squeezed too hard.

Sleep after that had been impossible.

He'd lain in his futon and stared at the ceiling and thought about all the questions he wanted to ask. Where did the man come from? Why did he talk funny? Not bad-funny, just different-funny, like the words came from somewhere far away even though they were the right words. Did he really live in America? Was America as big as Grandpa said? Did they really have buildings that touched the sky?

And most importantly: was he going to stay?

The waiting had been awful. He'd heard Rea-nee-san moving around, which meant it was almost time, but "almost" took *forever* when you were four and there were questions that needed asking. He'd counted the wooden slats in his ceiling. He'd counted his fingers. He'd counted his toes, which was harder because they were under the blanket and he kept losing track.

Finally—*finally*—the light outside had turned the right color and he could hear voices in the other room, and Tenchi had scrambled out of his futon so fast that he'd gotten tangled in the blanket and nearly fallen over.

But he hadn't fallen over. He'd gotten dressed all by himself (mostly by himself; the buttons were tricky) and he'd run down the hallway and he'd opened the door and—

There he was.

The man. Still here. Not a dream.

Tenchi's face split into a grin so wide it made his cheeks hurt.

---

### SHELDON

"You're still here!"

The declaration came with the force of absolute certainty, as though Tenchi had personally confirmed a universal constant. The boy stood in the doorway, slightly disheveled, his dark hair sticking up at angles that defied geometry. He was dressed in what appeared to be yesterday's clothes, the buttons of his shirt misaligned by one position, giving him a lopsided look that was somehow endearing.

"Good morning, Tenchi," Sheldon said.

"Good morning!" Tenchi crossed the room in three rapid strides and dropped to his knees at the table, claiming the space beside Sheldon as though it had always been his. "I woke up really early. Before the birds. Did you wake up before the birds? Rea-nee-san says only farmers and shrine keepers wake up before the birds but you're not a farmer, are you? Are you a shrine keeper? Grandpa is a shrine keeper. That's why we live at the shrine."

The torrent of words washed over Sheldon like a wave. He found himself smiling despite the early hour and the weight of unprocessed strangeness that still clung to everything.

"I woke up early," he confirmed. "Before the birds."

"See?" Tenchi turned to Katsuhito with a triumphant expression. "I told you not everyone waits for birds."

"You did tell me that," Katsuhito agreed mildly. "Approximately seventeen times."

"Because it's important." Tenchi turned back to Sheldon, his expression suddenly serious. "Do they have birds in America?"

"They do. Different birds, mostly, but yes."

"What kind of different?"

"Well." Sheldon considered how to explain avian biogeography to a four-year-old. "There are birds called cardinals—they're bright red, very beautiful. And blue jays, which are blue with white markings. And mockingbirds, which can copy the songs of other birds."

Tenchi's eyes went wide. "They can *copy* songs? Like... like a person?"

"A little bit. They hear other birds singing and then they sing the same song. Sometimes they even copy sounds that aren't birds—car alarms, or dogs barking."

"That's amazing." The word came out hushed, reverent. "I want to hear a mockingbird."

"They don't live in Japan, I'm afraid."

"Oh." A moment of disappointment, quickly overcome. "But you've heard them? In America?"

"Many times. They used to wake me up in the mornings."

Rea appeared beside the table, setting a bowl of rice and a cup of miso in front of Tenchi with practiced efficiency. "Eat your breakfast. You'll be late for school."

"I'm not going to be late. I'm always on time. Grandpa says I'm the most on-time person he knows."

"Grandpa is being generous," Katsuhito said. "Eat."

Tenchi made a face but picked up his chopsticks, attacking his rice with enthusiasm. Between bites, he continued his interrogation.

"What else is different in America? Is the rice different? Grandpa says rice is the most important food. Is American rice the same as our rice?"

"The rice is different," Sheldon admitted. "Longer grains, usually. And people don't eat it for breakfast as often."

This information was apparently shocking. Tenchi's chopsticks paused mid-bite. "What do they eat for breakfast then?"

"Eggs, often. Toast—that's grilled bread. Sometimes a kind of cake made in flat circles, with sweet syrup poured over it."

"Cake for *breakfast*?" The concept seemed to short-circuit something in Tenchi's understanding. "Every day?"

"Not every day. But sometimes."

"I want to go to America." The declaration was absolute. "I want to eat breakfast cake and hear mockingbirds."

"Perhaps someday," Katsuhito said. "But today, you have school. Finish your breakfast."

Tenchi resumed eating, but his eyes kept drifting back to Sheldon, filled with questions that were clearly queuing up for later deployment. Sheldon found himself cataloging the boy's features—the round face that would sharpen with age, the dark eyes so like his grandfather's yet somehow softer, more open. There was something familiar about him, though Sheldon couldn't place what. Not physical resemblance; more like... recognition. As though some part of him had been waiting to meet this child.

The thought was strange. He filed it away with all the other strange things.

"Do you have children?" Tenchi asked suddenly. "In America?"

The question caught Sheldon off-guard. "No."

"Why not?"

"Tenchi." Katsuhito's voice carried a gentle warning. "Some questions are too personal for breakfast."

"But I want to know." Tenchi turned back to Sheldon, undeterred. "Don't you like children?"

"I like children," Sheldon said carefully. "I just... haven't had any."

"You could have one here." The solution was presented as though it were obvious. "Then I would have someone to play with who isn't old."

"Tenchi." This time Katsuhito's tone brooked no argument. "Apologize."

"Sorry," Tenchi said, not sounding particularly sorry. "But it's true. You *are* old, Grandpa. And Rea-nee-san doesn't play the same way. She plays quiet games. I like loud games."

"I've noticed," Katsuhito said dryly.

Sheldon watched the exchange, something warming in his chest despite himself. This—the easy bickering, the casual intimacy of family, the way Tenchi's questions were deflected but never dismissed—this was something he recognized. Something he had lost when his grandmother died and his parents' house grew quiet and then quieter still.

He hadn't known he missed it until now.

"I'll be here for a while," he heard himself say. "While my house is being fixed. Perhaps we can find time for some loud games."

Tenchi's face lit up like sunrise. "Really? You promise?"

"I don't make promises lightly. But yes—I would like that."

"Then it's a deal." Tenchi stuck out his hand, small and slightly sticky from rice. "Grandpa says deals should be shaken on."

Sheldon took the offered hand and shook it gravely. "Then it's a deal."

From across the table, Katsuhito watched them both, his expression unreadable. But when Sheldon met his eyes, the old man gave a slight nod—acknowledgment, perhaps, or approval.

Or warning.

With Katsuhito, it was difficult to tell.

# Scene 2.4: Tenchi's Departure

The transformation of Tenchi from breakfast interrogator to schoolboy happened with remarkable speed.

Rea appeared with his school bag—a hard-sided leather randoseru in deep red, sized small for his frame—and began the process of making him presentable. The misaligned buttons were corrected with quick, efficient fingers. His hair was dampened and combed into something approaching order, though Sheldon suspected the improvement would last only until the boy moved his head. A yellow cap was produced from somewhere and placed firmly on his head, its brim shading his eyes.

"The cap marks him for the walking group," Katsuhito explained, watching the proceedings from his position at the table. "Children walk to school together. The older ones watch the younger."

"A sensible system."

"It keeps them safe. And teaches responsibility." Katsuhito rose smoothly, gathering his own outerwear. "I walk him to the bottom of the steps. The group gathers at the village shrine, and they proceed together from there."

Tenchi endured Rea's ministrations with visible impatience, bouncing slightly on his heels. When she finally pronounced him acceptable, he shot toward the door with the same explosive energy he'd brought to breakfast.

"Come on, Grandpa! We're going to be late!"

"We are not going to be late. We have never been late."

"There's always a first time! That's what you say!"

Sheldon followed them out onto the engawa, drawn by something he couldn't quite name. The morning air was cool and clean, washed fresh by the night's passage, and the shrine grounds lay golden in the early sun. Birds had finally begun their morning chorus—not mockingbirds, but something local and sweet-voiced, filling the air with liquid sound.

Tenchi paused at the edge of the veranda, looking back at Sheldon with sudden uncertainty. The boundless confidence of breakfast had flickered, replaced by something more vulnerable.

"You'll still be here when I get back?"

The question was quiet, meant for Sheldon alone.

"I'll be here."

"Promise?"

"I told you—I don't make promises lightly. But yes. I'll be here."

Tenchi's face relaxed. He reached up and touched the brim of his yellow cap, a gesture that seemed like a salute or a wave or both. "Okay. I'll tell you everything about school when I get back. *Everything*. Even the boring parts."

"I look forward to it."

"No you don't. The boring parts are really boring. But I'll tell you anyway because that's what friends do."

Friends. The word landed strangely, carrying weight that Sheldon hadn't expected. He had colleagues, acquaintances, professional connections spanning three continents. He had Maria, who was something close to friendship though neither of them had ever named it that. But a four-year-old declaring them friends, as simply and certainly as stating that the sky was blue—that was new.

"Then I'll listen to all of it," Sheldon said. "Even the boring parts."

Tenchi grinned and jumped off the veranda, landing on the stone path with a small thud. "Come *on*, Grandpa!"

Katsuhito moved past Sheldon, pausing briefly at his shoulder. "The house assessment," he said quietly. "After I return, we can discuss the village resources. Tanaka-san is the man for the roof. There are others for other work."

"Thank you."

A slight nod. Then Katsuhito was descending the steps, matching his pace to Tenchi's eager scramble. Sheldon watched them go—the old man moving with that strange fluid grace, the boy bouncing beside him like a satellite held in orbit by invisible forces.

At the first bend in the path, Tenchi turned and waved. The yellow cap was already slightly askew.

Sheldon raised his hand in response.

They disappeared around the corner, swallowed by the green of the forest and the steep descent of the three hundred and twenty steps. The bird song continued, indifferent to their passage, and the great tree's branches stirred in a breath of wind that Sheldon couldn't feel.

He stood on the engawa for a long moment, watching the empty path.

Behind him, the sounds of Rea clearing breakfast drifted through the open shoji—dishes being gathered, water being run, the small domestic noises of a household returning to its routine. The rhythm of it was strange and familiar at once: different details, same underlying structure. A home finding its shape around the people who lived in it.

Sheldon had lived alone for years. His apartment in Fairbanks had been functional and sparse, organized around the demands of work rather than the needs of a life. He hadn't realized how silent it had become until now, standing in a place filled with the sounds of other people existing.

The great tree caught his attention again. Its branches were still now, but he could have sworn they had moved a moment ago—not with the wind but *against* it, reaching toward the path where Tenchi had disappeared.

He filed that observation away with all the others.

There was work to do. A house to assess, a life to build, a thousand questions with no answers. Standing here watching an empty path wouldn't move any of that forward.

Sheldon turned and went back inside.

# Scene 2.5: Conversation with Katsuhito

**POV:** Multi (Sheldon primary, Katsuhito secondary)

### SHELDON

The thirty minutes of Katsuhito's absence passed quickly.

Sheldon helped Rea clear the breakfast dishes—a contribution she accepted with apparent reluctance but no overt objection. He learned the locations of things: the cabinet where bowls were stored, the shelf for the lacquerware, the particular way the kitchen was organized that spoke of years of habit. Rea answered his questions with minimal words and maximum efficiency, but she did answer them, which felt like progress.

When the dishes were done, she had looked at him for a long moment, something calculating in her gaze.

"Masaki-sama will return soon. Tea on the engawa is his custom in the mornings. I will bring it."

So Sheldon had come out to the wooden veranda that wrapped around the residence, and found himself a position near the corner where he could see both the courtyard and the forest path. A cushion appeared beside him a few minutes later—Rea's doing, though he hadn't seen her deliver it—and shortly after that, a tray with two cups and a steaming pot.

He waited.

Katsuhito emerged from the tree line with no apparent effort, despite having just climbed three hundred and twenty steps. His breathing was even, his pace unchanged from when he'd descended. Sheldon noted this and added it to his growing file of observations about the old priest.

"Tea," Katsuhito said, settling onto the engawa beside him. "Good. Rea knows the rhythms of this household better than anyone."

"She is very capable."

"She is." Katsuhito poured for both of them, the gesture familiar and precise. "She came to us three years ago, after Kiyone died. To help with Tenchi. She stayed."

The mention of Kiyone—Tenchi's mother, from what Sheldon had gathered—opened questions he wasn't sure how to ask. He took his tea instead and let the silence stretch.

"You have questions," Katsuhito said. It wasn't a question.

"Many."

"Ask the ones that matter most. The morning is short and there is work to do."

Sheldon considered. There were so many things he wanted to know—about this place, about his apparent family history, about the nature of whatever power had brought him here. But Katsuhito couldn't answer most of those questions. What he could answer was more practical.

"The house," Sheldon said. "My aunt's house. You offered to help me find craftsmen for repairs. I'd like to understand what I'm facing."

"A reasonable place to start." Katsuhito sipped his tea, eyes on the distant mountains. "The house has been empty for two years. I arranged for basic maintenance—aired the rooms, checked for pests, kept the worst of the decay at bay. But it needs work. The roof most urgently. There is damage on the northeast corner that will worsen with the summer rains."

"The roof I noticed. What else?"

"The garden has gone to seed. The well needs testing—the water may be good or may need treatment. The shop building in front is structurally sound but has not been used for its purpose in many years." Katsuhito paused. "Your aunt was a pharmacist. Traditional medicine. The shop was where she saw patients and prepared treatments. After she became ill, that work stopped."

New information. Sheldon filed it carefully. "A pharmacist."

"Licensed and trained. She studied in Osaka before returning here. The village relied on her for many things." Another pause. "They will be curious about you. Whether you intend to continue her work."

"I'm not a pharmacist."

"No. You are something else." Katsuhito's eyes found his, sharp and assessing. "A scholar, I think. The way you hold yourself, the way you observe and catalogue. What do you study?"

The question was simple on its surface and treacherous beneath. Sheldon could answer truthfully—physics, theoretical physics, the mathematics of reality itself—but that answer would raise more questions than it resolved. What was a theoretical physicist doing inheriting a traditional pharmacist's house in rural Japan?

"I'm on sabbatical," he said carefully. "Taking time away from my work to... reconsider."

"Reconsider what?"

"Everything."

### KATSUHITO

The young man was hiding something. That much had been clear from the moment he arrived—the careful way he chose his words, the gaps between what he said and what he meant, the distant look that came over him when he thought no one was watching.

Katsuhito had lived a very long time. He had learned to recognize when someone was carrying weight they couldn't speak of.

This one carried more than most.

"Sabbatical," he repeated, testing the word. "A time of rest and reflection. The scriptures speak of such things."

"You're familiar with western religious traditions?"

"I am familiar with many traditions. Truth wears different clothes in different places, but underneath, the shape is often the same." He refilled their cups, using the gesture to consider his next words. "You came here seeking something. Rest, perhaps. Or distance from whatever drove you to need rest."

"I came here because I inherited a house."

"Did you?"

The question landed like a stone in still water. Katsuhito watched the young man's face, seeing the flicker of something—surprise, calculation, wariness—before it was smoothed away.

"The documents are clear," Sheldon said. "My aunt's house, left to me in her will."

"Documents are often clear. That does not make them complete." Katsuhito turned his gaze to the great tree, letting its presence settle into his awareness. "I knew Michiko-san for forty years. She spoke of family in America—a sister who married a foreigner, a nephew she had never met. But she also spoke of other things. Hopes. Fears. The feeling that her time was running short and her work was not complete."

"What work?"

"I do not know. She did not say, and I did not ask. Some things are meant to be carried privately." He looked back at the young man beside him. "You carry something too. I will not ask what. But if you need help with the carrying, the mountain has room."

---

### SHELDON

The offer was genuine. Sheldon could hear it in Katsuhito's voice, see it in the steady way he met Sheldon's eyes. Not pity, not obligation—something simpler and older than either. The hospitality of a place that had been accepting strangers for a very long time.

"I don't know how long I'll be here," Sheldon said. "Weeks, certainly. Perhaps longer."

"Time is flexible. The house will take time to repair. The garden will take longer. And Tenchi..." A slight smile creased Katsuhito's weathered face. "Tenchi has claimed you. That will take longest of all."

"He is... enthusiastic."

"He is lonely." The smile faded. "He lost his mother three years ago. His father works in the city and can only visit on weekends. He has Rea, but she is quiet and careful, not built for the games he wants to play. He has me, but I am—as he correctly observes—old."

"He's attached quickly."

"He has good instincts for people. Better than most adults I have known." Katsuhito finished his tea and set the cup down with a soft click. "I will not tell you what to do, Tsukino-san. But I will say this: if you stay, stay properly. Do not make promises you cannot keep. Children remember promises, and they remember when those promises are broken."

The warning was delivered gently, but it was a warning nonetheless.

"I understand."

"Good." Katsuhito rose, the motion smooth and effortless. "Now. We should tour the shrine grounds properly. You are a guest here, but guests should know the shape of the place where they are staying. There are rules. Not many, but important."

Sheldon stood as well, leaving his empty cup on the tray. "Rules?"

"The cave on the north path. You will see it today. You will notice the markers that indicate where visitors should not go." Katsuhito's voice had changed—still warm, but with something harder underneath. "Respect those markers. Do not pass them. Do not enter the cave."

"May I ask why?"

"You may ask. I will not answer fully. Only this: there are some things in this world that are better left sleeping. The cave contains one of them."

The words sent a chill down Sheldon's spine that had nothing to do with the morning air. Katsuhito spoke with absolute certainty, the voice of someone who knew exactly what he was talking about.

"I understand," Sheldon said again. And this time, he meant it differently.

"Good." The hardness faded as quickly as it had appeared, replaced by the mild warmth of the priest who had welcomed him the day before. "Come. I will show you the grounds. And then we will discuss Tanaka-san and the roof."

They walked together toward the main courtyard, their footsteps soft on the ancient stone.

# Scene 2.6: Exploring the Shrine Grounds

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 09:00 - 10:30
**Location:** Shrine complex - courtyard, buildings, paths
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 2,500

---

The shrine revealed itself in layers.

Katsuhito led him first to the main courtyard, the open space Sheldon had glimpsed from various angles since his arrival. By daylight, with time to observe properly, the details emerged: the torii gate's vermillion paint faded to a dignified rust by decades of sun; the stone lanterns placed at precise intervals along the path, their openings dark and cold; the offering box before the main hall, weathered wood worn smooth by generations of hands.

"The shrine is called Masaki Jinja," Katsuhito said. "It has stood here for seven hundred years, though the buildings themselves are newer. Fire and weather take their toll. We rebuild as needed."

"What does it enshrine?"

"Officially? The spirits of this mountain. The kami of the forest and the water and the stone." Katsuhito's voice was even, but Sheldon caught something beneath the surface—amusement, perhaps, or the particular tone of someone telling a truth wrapped in a lie. "Unofficially, it is simply old. Some places gather power by existing. This is one of them."

They moved past the main hall to the subsidiary buildings that clustered behind it. A small storehouse with thick walls and a heavy lock. A workshop where tools hung in neat rows—carpentry implements, gardening equipment, things for repair and maintenance. A covered walkway connecting the various structures, allowing passage in all weather.

"The shrine receives few formal visitors," Katsuhito continued. "Festivals bring the village, and certain ceremonies draw people from farther away. But day to day, it is quiet. Rea and I handle the maintenance. Tenchi helps when he is not at school." A slight pause. "If you wish to help during your stay, the work is simple but endless."

"I would welcome something to do with my hands."

"Then we will find you tasks. Sweeping, tending the lanterns, checking the paths for damage. Nothing complicated, but necessary."

They emerged from behind the main hall onto a path Sheldon hadn't seen before. It wound away from the formal shrine area, climbing gently through increasingly dense forest. The trees here were old—massive cedars whose trunks required three men to span, their branches creating a canopy that filtered the morning light to green-gold fragments.

"This path leads to the cave," Katsuhito said. "I will show you the boundary markers."

They walked in silence for several minutes. The forest sounds seemed to deepen as they climbed—bird calls more distant, the rustle of undergrowth more present, the air itself thicker and older. Sheldon found himself breathing more carefully, as though excessive noise might disturb something that was listening.

Then the great tree came into view.

He had seen it from the courtyard, glimpsed it from his window, observed its presence dominating the shrine grounds. But he hadn't realized—hadn't understood—how *vast* it truly was. Standing at its base, looking up, the scale became impossible to process. The trunk rose like a column supporting heaven itself, its surface not bark but something smoother, more organic, rippling with patterns that almost resembled text. The branches spread in geometric precision, each major limb dividing into smaller limbs dividing into smaller still, the fractal mathematics of growth made manifest.

Sheldon's breath caught.

He had spent his career studying the underlying mathematics of reality—the equations that described how particles behaved, how forces propagated, how space-time itself could be described in terms of numbers and relationships. He had seen beauty in equations, elegance in proofs, the crystalline perfection of theories that fit together like puzzle pieces.

This was different.

This was mathematics made *alive*. Not described by numbers but embodying them, every angle and proportion speaking of ratios that shouldn't exist in nature. The tree was beautiful the way a proof was beautiful—not aesthetically, not emotionally, but fundamentally. True in a way that transcended opinion.

"You feel it," Katsuhito said.

It wasn't a question. Sheldon turned to find the old man watching him with an expression that was almost pleased.

"What is it?"

"A tree. Very old. Sacred to this place." Katsuhito moved to stand beside him, both of them looking up at the impossible canopy. "Some say it was planted when the shrine was founded. Others say it was already old when the first stones were laid. I do not know the truth. I only know that it has been here longer than any record remembers, and that it will be here long after we are gone."

"It's..." Sheldon searched for words and found them inadequate. "Remarkable."

"Yes." Katsuhito's voice was soft. "It has many names. The locals call it the sacred tree, or simply the great tree. I call it Funaho."

The name landed strangely, carrying resonance that Sheldon couldn't explain. He wanted to ask more—why that name, what it meant, whether Katsuhito understood what he was standing before—but the questions tangled in his throat.

Something shifted in the canopy above. Not wind—the air was still—but movement nonetheless. A rustling, a settling, as though the branches were adjusting their position. Sheldon looked up and could have sworn that a limb closer to him had bent slightly, like a person turning their head to get a better look.

"She likes you," Katsuhito said mildly.

"She?"

"A manner of speaking. Trees do not have gender as humans understand it. But Funaho has always felt feminine to me. Watchful. Protective. Like a mother keeping eye on her children." He began walking again, following the path past the tree's massive base. "Come. The markers are just ahead."

Sheldon followed, but his eyes kept returning to the tree. The branches hadn't moved again—or if they had, the motion was too subtle to catch directly. But he couldn't shake the feeling of being observed, assessed, measured against some standard he didn't understand.

The path narrowed as they continued, the forest pressing closer on either side. Then, abruptly, they emerged into a small clearing. On the far side, the mountain rose in a sheer face of dark stone, and in that stone—

A cave.

The entrance was perhaps three meters wide and two tall, a dark mouth in the rock that seemed to swallow light. Before it, driven into the ground at regular intervals, were wooden posts marked with rope and paper streamers—shimenawa, Sheldon's new linguistic knowledge supplied. The sacred boundary markers of Shinto practice, indicating that what lay beyond was forbidden or holy or both.

The markers formed a clear line. Beyond that line, nothing living grew. The ground was bare stone and dry earth, as though the soil itself had been drained of vitality.

"You feel it," Katsuhito said again.

Sheldon did. Standing here, facing that dark opening, every instinct he possessed was screaming at him to turn around and walk away. The cave *wanted* something. Or contained something that wanted. The boundary markers weren't symbolic—they were a warning as real as any danger sign he had ever seen.

"What's in there?"

"I will not answer that question fully." Katsuhito's voice had taken on that harder quality again, the steel beneath the silk. "I will say this: seven hundred years ago, something was sealed in that cave. Something powerful and dangerous. The seal has held for all that time. It will continue to hold, as long as the markers are respected."

"And if they're not respected?"

"Then what sleeps will wake. And many people will die."

The words were delivered without drama, without emphasis. Simple statement of fact. Sheldon believed them absolutely.

"I understand."

"Good. Then we will not speak of it again unless necessary." Katsuhito turned away from the cave, his posture relaxing as they put distance between themselves and that dark mouth. "There are lighter things to show you. The well. The garden. The paths that lead to the village. Come."

They walked back through the forest, past the great tree—whose branches Sheldon could have sworn rustled in greeting as they passed—and down toward the more familiar territory of the shrine grounds. The weight of the cave's presence faded with distance, but didn't disappear entirely. Sheldon suspected it never would, now that he knew it was there.

Katsuhito showed him the well behind the main hall, its water clear and cold and sweet. He showed him the garden where vegetables grew in neat rows, tended by Rea's careful hands. He showed him the storage buildings and their contents, the tools and supplies that kept the shrine functioning.

Through it all, Sheldon observed and catalogued and filed away. The layout of the grounds, the location of resources, the thousand small details that made a place function. His mind worked automatically, building mental maps and noting relationships, the habit of a lifetime of academic precision.

But beneath that automatic process, something else was working too.

The cave. The tree. The feeling of being watched, assessed, measured. Katsuhito's warnings, delivered with the certainty of someone who knew exactly what he was talking about.

This place was not what it seemed. There were layers here that Sheldon hadn't begun to understand.

And somewhere in that cave, something was sleeping.

He would respect the markers. He would stay away from the forbidden ground. But he would also watch, and listen, and try to understand what kind of world he had landed in.

Because the answers mattered. Perhaps more than anything else.

# Scene 2.7: The Tsukino House (Second Visit)

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 10:30 - 12:00
**Location:** Tsukino property
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 2,500

---

The path from the shrine to the Tsukino property took fifteen minutes at an easy pace.

Katsuhito had pointed him in the right direction—down the secondary path rather than the main steps, through a stretch of forest where the trees grew closer together and the undergrowth was thicker. The trail was narrow but well-maintained, worn smooth by years of foot traffic between the two properties.

Sheldon walked it alone, his thoughts churning with everything he had learned that morning.

The cave. The tree. The weight of seven hundred years of history pressing down on this small patch of mountain. He had come here expecting... what? A quiet place to recover, to figure out what had happened to him, to build some kind of life from the pieces he'd been given. He hadn't expected ancient seals and watchful trees and warnings delivered with deadly seriousness.

But then, he hadn't expected any of this. Not the field of flowers, not the body that wasn't quite his, not the wallet full of documents describing a life he'd never lived. Compared to those impossibilities, what was one more mystery?

The forest opened onto the Tsukino property with sudden clarity. One moment he was surrounded by trees; the next, he stood at the edge of an overgrown garden, looking at the house that was apparently his.

It looked different in daylight.

The structure was larger than he'd realized the day before—a traditional farmhouse with a deep roof and wide eaves, its wooden walls weathered to silver-grey. The roof damage he'd noted was more visible now: a section on the northeast corner where tiles were missing and the underlying structure was exposed. Water stains ran down that side of the building, marking where rain had found its way inside.

Beyond the main house, the shop building sat slightly forward and to the side, positioned to face the path that would once have brought customers from the village. Its doors were closed, its windows dark, but the structure itself looked solid. A pharmacist's shop, Katsuhito had said. Traditional medicine. The village had relied on Michiko for many things.

Sheldon approached the main house first.

The door was unlocked—Katsuhito had mentioned arranging basic maintenance, which apparently included ensuring access. The hinges protested slightly as he pushed it open, releasing a breath of stale air that carried the scent of cedar and old tatami and something faintly herbal.

Inside, dust motes danced in the light that filtered through dirty windows. The entryway was small, the traditional *genkan* with its lower area for removing shoes. Sheldon stepped up onto the main floor and began his assessment.

The first room was clearly the main living space—what would have been the *ima* in traditional terminology. A low table occupied the center, surrounded by worn cushions. A *tokonoma* alcove held a scroll and a ceramic vase, both covered in a fine layer of dust. The tatami underfoot was old but intact, giving slightly under his weight.

He moved through the house systematically, room by room. Kitchen with its wood-fired stove and array of ceramic vessels. A storage room packed with boxes and bundles wrapped in cloth. Two sleeping rooms with futons rolled and stored in closets. A small bathroom with a wooden tub and a solar water heater that might or might not still function.

The roof damage was confined to one corner, as he'd hoped. Water had found its way through the missing tiles and stained the ceiling of one of the sleeping rooms, but the structural beams seemed sound. Repair rather than replacement. Tanaka, whoever he was, would be able to assess properly.

The well was in the back garden, a traditional stone-lined shaft with a wooden cover. Sheldon removed the cover and peered down into the darkness. He could smell water—clean, with no hint of contamination. He would need to test it properly, but his first impression was positive.

The pump at the kitchen sink confirmed his assessment from the day before. Three primes and water flowed, clear and cold and sweet. The plumbing was simple but functional, drawing directly from the well. He let it run for several minutes, watching for discoloration or debris, and saw none.

The garden was a different story.

What had once been productive land was now a wilderness of overgrowth. He could see the bones of it—raised beds outlined in stone, the remnants of trellises, a cold frame for starting seedlings in early spring. But weeds had claimed everything, binding the old plants in their embrace, transforming order into chaos.

It would take weeks to clear. Months to restore. But the soil looked good—dark and rich, the accumulation of years of careful tending. Someone had loved this garden once. Had put their hands in this earth and coaxed life from it.

Sheldon stood in the overgrown space and felt the weight of inheritance pressing down on him.

Not his inheritance, really. He was an imposter here, wearing a dead woman's nephew like a mask. Whatever entity had placed him in this world had created documentation and backstory and even a convenient property, but none of it was *his*. None of it was earned.

Yet the house was real. The garden was real. The need for repairs and restoration was real. Whether he deserved any of it was almost beside the point. He was here. The work existed. Someone had to do it.

He turned back toward the house and noticed the shop building's rear entrance, partially hidden by overgrown bamboo. On impulse, he pushed through the vegetation and tried the door.

Unlocked, like the main house.

The interior was dim and dusty and smelled of herbs. As his eyes adjusted, shapes emerged from the shadows: shelves lining every wall, stocked with hundreds of small drawers and ceramic jars. A workbench in the center, its surface stained with years of preparation work. A scale, its brass pans tarnished but intact. Books stacked in one corner, their spines marked with characters he could read but didn't yet understand.

A pharmacist's shop. A healer's workplace. Everything arranged with the precision of someone who knew exactly what they were doing.

Sheldon moved along the shelves, reading labels. *Cinnamon bark. Astragalus root. Ginseng. Licorice. Angelica.* The names triggered something in his new linguistic knowledge—not just words but context. Uses. Preparations. The underlying theory of traditional medicine that saw the body as a system of balance and flow, treating illness by restoring harmony rather than attacking symptoms.

He had never studied any of this. His body had never learned it. Yet the knowledge was *there*, embedded in the language that had been given to him, waiting to be accessed.

The realization was unsettling. What else had been given to him that he hadn't discovered yet? What other knowledge lay dormant in this reset brain, waiting for the right trigger to emerge?

He was reaching for one of the ceramic jars when something else caught his attention. A frame, hanging on the wall near the entrance. Behind the dusty glass, a photograph.

Sheldon lifted it down and wiped the glass with his sleeve.

Three people looked back at him from another era. A woman in her fifties, perhaps, with a kind face and silver-streaked hair—Michiko, he assumed. A younger woman beside her, features similar enough to mark them as relations—the sister? His supposed mother? And between them, a boy of perhaps seven or eight, dark-haired and serious-faced, standing stiff in formal clothing.

The boy had his eyes.

Sheldon stared at the photograph for a long moment. The details were wrong—he had never worn such clothing, never stood in this shop, never looked up at this woman with that particular expression of dutiful patience. Yet the face was undeniably his. Younger, unfamiliar, belonging to a childhood he had never lived.

Somewhere, somehow, Sheldon Tsukino had existed. Or was made to have existed. The documentation in his wallet wasn't forgery—it was history, created whole-cloth and inserted into the fabric of reality.

He didn't know what to do with that realization. It was too large, too fundamental, to process standing in a dusty shop surrounded by herbs he hadn't learned to identify.

He hung the photograph back on its nail and walked outside.

The sun was climbing toward noon, burning off the last of the morning mist. From the garden, he could see the shrine's torii gate in the distance, just visible above the tree line. The great tree's branches spread against the sky, unmistakable even at this distance.

This would be his home. This garden, this house, this property that came with a history and expectations and the weight of a woman's life work. He didn't deserve it—that much was clear—but he could *earn* it. Could put his hands in this soil and his sweat into these walls and make it his through labor rather than documentation.

It was something to hold onto. A purpose, where before there had only been questions.

He began walking back toward the shrine. There was lunch to attend, and work to discuss, and a four-year-old who had been promised stories about mockingbirds.

The roof could wait until tomorrow. The garden could wait longer. But the living—the actual living of this new life—couldn't wait at all.

# Scene 2.8: Lunch at the Shrine

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 12:00 - 13:00
**Location:** Shrine residence - kitchen/dining area
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 1,800

Rea had lunch waiting when Sheldon returned.

The table was set for two—Katsuhito, she explained, was handling a visitor at the shrine itself. Someone from the village council about a summer festival matter. He would eat later, if he ate at all; administrative conversations often ran long.

This left Sheldon alone with Rea for the first time since his arrival.

The meal was simple: rice, pickled vegetables, a clear soup with mushrooms, cold fish arranged on small plates. Rea served it with the same efficiency she brought to everything, her movements precise and economical, wasting nothing.

They ate in silence for several minutes. Sheldon was comfortable with silence—years of solitary work had trained him for it—but this silence had a texture he couldn't quite read. Not hostile, certainly. Not exactly welcoming either. Something between observation and assessment, the quiet of someone gathering data.

"The house," Rea said finally. "How did you find it?"

"Livable, with work. The roof needs repair—there's damage on the northeast corner. The well seems good. The pump functions." He paused. "The garden will take longer."

"Michiko-san loved that garden." Rea's eyes were on her bowl, her chopsticks moving in small precise bites. "She grew herbs there. For the shop. And vegetables for herself, though she often gave them away."

"You knew her?"

"I came after she died. But the village talks." A slight shrug. "They talk about everything."

"Including me, I imagine."

"The American nephew." There was no inflection in Rea's voice—simple statement of fact. "They have been curious since the will was read. Who would inherit. Whether you would come."

"And now that I have?"

"Now they are curious about other things." She set down her chopsticks and looked at him directly. "Why you came. Whether you will stay. What you intend to do with the shop."

"I'm not a pharmacist."

"They know. They wonder anyway." Her gaze was steady, assessing. "The village is small. It needs certain things. A doctor visits from Kamogata twice a month. The nearest hospital is forty minutes away by car. Michiko-san filled a gap. Without her, that gap remains."

Sheldon absorbed this. The weight of expectation, pressing down before he had even properly arrived. Not just a house to repair, but a role to fill. A function in a community he didn't know.

"I can't practice medicine," he said carefully. "I don't have the training. Or the license."

"Traditional medicine is different from western medicine. The regulations are... flexible, in rural areas. If someone knows the herbs. If they have studied." Rea's eyes flickered to his hands, then back to his face. "If they were willing to learn."

The implication hung in the air between them.

"You're suggesting I could become what Michiko was?"

"I am suggesting that the village needs someone. And that her books are still in the shop. Her supplies. Her records of what she made and for whom." Rea resumed eating, her tone returning to neutrality. "It is only information. What you do with it is your decision."

Sheldon thought about the shop building. The shelves full of herbs. The knowledge embedded in his language download that had identified those herbs without conscious effort. The books Rea mentioned, presumably containing years of accumulated wisdom.

It was impossible. He was a physicist, not a healer. His training was in mathematics and theory, not flesh and plant and the subtle art of restoring balance.

But then, his training was also in a body that was dead, in a world that was gone, in a life that had ended in a cascade failure beneath the Alaskan tundra. Everything he had been was gone. What he would become was still being written.

"I'll think about it," he said.

Rea nodded, apparently satisfied with that answer. They returned to their meal.

The silence was different now. Not observation but something closer to acceptance. Sheldon had the sense of having passed some kind of test—not fully, perhaps, but enough to shift his category from "stranger" to something slightly more.

"You came here after Kiyone died," he said. It wasn't a question.

Rea's chopsticks paused for just a moment. "Yes."

"To help with Tenchi."

"Yes."

"But you stayed."

The pause was longer this time. Rea set down her chopsticks and folded her hands in her lap. Her expression remained composed, but something shifted in her eyes.

"I stayed because I was needed. The shrine requires maintenance. Tenchi requires care. Masaki-sama is..." She searched for words. "Capable. But he is also old, and tired, and grieving in his own way. I could help. So I stayed."

"And your own family?"

"I have none." The words came flat, without emotion. "I was raised in an institution. When I came of age, I needed work. Masaki-sama's advertisement was... fortuitous."

Sheldon absorbed this information. An orphan, then. Or something like it. Someone who had come to this place with nothing and found a home in the service of others.

They had that much in common, at least.

"The shrine is fortunate to have you," he said.

Something flickered across Rea's face—surprise, perhaps, or the brief disorientation of an unexpected kindness. Then her expression smoothed back to its careful neutrality.

"Thank you, Tsukino-san." She rose and began gathering dishes. "More tea?"

"Please."

She moved to the kitchen, and Sheldon watched her go. There were layers to Rea that he hadn't begun to understand. She was young—his mental estimate put her somewhere between fifteen and seventeen—but she moved through this household with the competence of someone much older. An old soul, his grandmother would have said. Someone who had seen too much too young.

Or perhaps not seen at all. Perhaps that was the price of being raised without a family—growing up quickly because there was no one to grow up slowly for.

He filed the information away with everything else. The day was accumulating data faster than he could process it.

When Rea returned with fresh tea, she sat down across from him instead of retreating to the kitchen. Another small shift. Another barrier lowered.

"Tenchi will be home at three," she said. "He will want to show you things. Tell you things. He has been..." A pause. "Excited. Since yesterday."

"He mentioned wanting to build a fort."

"He has mentioned it every day for two weeks. Masaki-sama was... not available for such projects." The faintest hint of a smile touched her lips. "I am not built for forts either."

"I promised loud games."

"I heard." The smile grew slightly. "You may regret that promise."

"Perhaps. But I'll keep it anyway."

Rea studied him for a long moment, that assessing gaze returning. Then she nodded once, as though confirming something to herself.

"I think you will," she said. And returned to her tea.

# Scene 2.9: Afternoon Work

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 13:00 - 15:00
**Location:** Shrine grounds
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 2,000

Katsuhito found him in the garden behind the residence, watching Rea hang laundry on lines strung between wooden posts.

"The council meeting has concluded," the old man said. "The summer festival will proceed as planned. There was much discussion of lantern placement."

"Important matters."

"To the village council, all matters are important. That is both their strength and their weakness." Katsuhito moved to stand beside him, observing the same scene of domestic normalcy. "You have eaten?"

"Rea was kind enough to provide lunch."

"She is kind to everyone. It is her nature." A slight pause. "She does not always show it in obvious ways."

"I noticed."

Katsuhito turned to study him directly. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy something, because he nodded once and gestured toward the main courtyard.

"You offered to help with shrine duties. I would begin your education now, if you are willing."

"I'm willing."

They walked together through the residence and out into the courtyard proper. The sun was high now, burning off the last of the morning's coolness, and the stone pathways radiated warmth. Katsuhito led him to a small storage building near the workshop and produced a broom—not the stiff-bristled type Sheldon might have expected, but something softer, bound with hemp cord.

"Sweeping," Katsuhito said. "The foundation of all shrine maintenance. It seems simple. It is not."

He demonstrated. The motion was different from ordinary sweeping—not pushing the debris but lifting it, guiding it, working with the grain of the stone rather than against. The broom's soft bristles barely touched the surface, yet leaves and dirt gathered in its wake as though magnetized.

"The goal is not to move debris," Katsuhito explained. "The goal is to restore the stone to its proper state. Debris is a symptom. Cleanliness is the cure."

Sheldon took the broom and attempted to replicate the motion. His first few strokes were clumsy—too hard, too fast, fighting the material rather than working with it. But his body responded to correction with unusual grace, adjusting his grip and angle until the motion began to flow more naturally.

"Better," Katsuhito said. "You have a good foundation. Your body wants to move efficiently."

"I was a runner in my youth. Track and field." The lie came easily—it was even partially true, in the life he remembered. "The training stays with you."

"Physical discipline transfers. One learns the body, and the body remembers." Katsuhito watched him work for several minutes, offering occasional corrections. "Slower. Let the broom find its rhythm. You are not attacking the stone; you are caring for it."

The philosophy beneath the practical instruction was evident. Sheldon had encountered similar approaches in other contexts—the Japanese concepts of *kaizen* and *shokunin*, the idea that even simple tasks contained depths worth exploring. His academic career had been built on a version of the same principle: that understanding the fundamentals deeply led to insights that skipping them never could.

He swept for nearly an hour, methodically working his way across the main courtyard. His arms ached by the end—not from effort but from unfamiliarity, muscles being asked to work in ways they hadn't before. His body might be younger and stronger than it had been, but it still needed training.

When the courtyard was clear, Katsuhito nodded approval and moved to the next lesson.

The stone lanterns required a different kind of attention. Each one needed to be checked for damage—cracks in the stone, degradation of the mortar, accumulation of debris in the openings. Some held candles, others were purely decorative, but all required the same careful inspection.

"Fire is sacred," Katsuhito said, demonstrating how to replace a spent candle with a fresh one. "We do not light the lanterns often—only for festivals and certain ceremonies—but we maintain them always. Readiness is its own form of respect."

Sheldon learned to read the signs of weathering, to identify hairline cracks before they became structural problems, to understand which types of lichen should be left to grow and which should be carefully removed. The work was precise and meditative, demanding attention without requiring thought—exactly the kind of task that let his mind process everything else.

And there was much to process.

The morning's revelations circled through his thoughts as his hands moved through the careful work. The cave and its sleeping occupant. The tree that felt like mathematics made alive. Rea's suggestion that he might become the village healer, filling a role that belonged to a woman he had never met. The photograph of a boy with his face, evidence of a history that had been created rather than lived.

None of it made sense. All of it was real.

Katsuhito let him work in silence, offering guidance only when needed. It was a teaching style Sheldon recognized—his own doctoral advisor had been similar, trusting his students to find their own insights rather than forcing conclusions. The patience required for such an approach was rare. The results were usually worth the investment.

The afternoon shadows were lengthening when Katsuhito called a halt.

"Enough for today. You have done well."

Sheldon straightened, rolling his shoulders to release the tension that had accumulated. His body felt pleasantly tired—the honest fatigue of physical work rather than the hollow exhaustion of magic depletion.

"I have more to learn."

"Always. That is the nature of learning." Katsuhito gestured toward the engawa, where Rea had at some point appeared with tea. "Rest now. Tenchi will return soon, and you will need your energy."

They walked together toward the residence. Sheldon found himself cataloguing the day's lessons automatically—the angle of the broom stroke, the signs of lantern damage, the rhythm of maintenance work. His hands held the memory of new skills, rough and imprecise but real.

"Thank you for teaching me," he said.

Katsuhito glanced at him sideways. "You learn quickly. Most people require many lessons before they stop fighting the broom."

"I'm used to learning new systems."

"Yes." The old man's voice was thoughtful. "I can see that. What you study in your other life—your sabbatical work—it involves systems?"

The question was carefully phrased, leaving room for either truth or deflection. Sheldon chose something between the two.

"I study the rules that govern how things work. The underlying mathematics of reality."

"Ah." Katsuhito nodded slowly. "A physicist, then. Or something like it."

"Something like it."

"Interesting." They reached the engawa and settled onto the cushions Rea had laid out. "Physics looks for the laws beneath the surface. The patterns that explain what we observe. It is not so different from shrine keeping, in its way."

"How so?"

"Both require patience. Both involve looking at what is visible and inferring what is not. Both seek harmony—physics seeks the harmony of equations, shrine keeping seeks the harmony of place and spirit." Katsuhito accepted the tea Rea offered with a small nod. "The tools are different. The goal is the same."

Sheldon turned this over in his mind. It was an unexpected parallel, but not an inaccurate one. His life's work had been seeking the elegant equations that described reality—and what was elegance but a kind of harmony? A feeling that things fit together properly, that the universe was not arbitrary but designed?

"Perhaps you're right," he said.

"Perhaps." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "Or perhaps I am simply an old man who enjoys finding connections where none exist. Age brings either wisdom or the convincing appearance of it. I have never been certain which."

From the forest path came the sound of rapid footsteps and a young voice calling out something indistinct.

Katsuhito's smile widened.

"Ah. The small tornado returns. Prepare yourself, Tsukino-san."

# Scene 2.10: Tenchi Returns

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 15:00 - 16:00
**Location:** Shrine steps → residence
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon primary, Tenchi secondary)

### TENCHI

The walk home from school was the *longest*.

Tenchi had tried to count the steps—all three hundred and twenty of them—but he kept losing track because his feet wanted to go faster than his counting brain. Today was worse than usual because he knew what was waiting at the top.

The man. The tall man with the strange name. Sheldon-san, who had promised to be there when Tenchi got home.

What if he wasn't there?

What if he had left while Tenchi was at school, gone back to America or wherever people like him went? What if the morning had been the last time, and Tenchi wouldn't get to ask his questions or hear about mockingbirds or show him the drawings he'd made during free time?

The worry made his feet move faster. He scrambled up the last section of steps, ignoring the burning in his legs, and burst onto the shrine grounds with his heart pounding and his breath coming in gasps.

There.

Sitting on the engawa with Grandpa, holding a cup of tea, looking exactly like he had that morning—

The relief was so strong it made Tenchi want to cry, but he didn't cry because crying was for babies and he was four and a half now, which was practically grown up.

Instead he ran.

---

### SHELDON

The boy appeared at the top of the steps like a small projectile launched from below.

Sheldon had approximately two seconds to register the yellow cap, the bouncing school bag, the expression of desperate joy—and then Tenchi was crossing the courtyard at full speed, heading directly for the engawa.

"You stayed!"

The declaration came with the same force as this morning's. Tenchi skidded to a halt at the edge of the veranda, breathing hard, his face flushed with exertion.

"I said I would."

"I know but—" Tenchi climbed onto the engawa and collapsed beside Sheldon, his small body radiating heat from the climb. "Sometimes people say things and then they don't do them. But you did the thing you said. That's good."

"That's how promises work."

"Not always." Tenchi's voice was matter-of-fact, carrying the weight of experience that shouldn't have fit in such a small person. "Daddy promised to come for my birthday but then his work said no. It wasn't his fault but the promise still broke."

Sheldon absorbed this information. Nobuyuki, working in the city. The weekend visits that were all he could manage. The promises that external circumstances could shatter regardless of intention.

"I'll try to keep my promises," he said carefully. "And if I can't keep one, I'll tell you why."

"That's fair." Tenchi had already moved on, reaching into his school bag with renewed energy. "I drew pictures. Do you want to see? I drew a mockingbird even though I don't know what one looks like, so I had to guess. Sensei said it was very creative."

The drawing that emerged was a riot of colors—a bird-shaped entity rendered in every crayon the school provided, with wings that seemed too large and a beak that curved at an improbable angle. It looked nothing like any mockingbird Sheldon had ever seen, but it had a chaotic joy that made him smile.

"It's wonderful."

"It's *creative*," Tenchi corrected. "That's what Sensei said. Creative means you do it different than everyone else."

"That's exactly what it means."

"I know." Tenchi produced another drawing—this one showing stick figures in front of a house. "This is you and me and Grandpa and Rea-nee-san. That's the shrine. See the big tree? I made it really big because it *is* really big."

The tree in the drawing was indeed enormous, taking up nearly half the page. Its branches spread in wild spirals, rendered in green and brown and something that might have been purple.

"Why purple?" Sheldon asked.

"Because sometimes when I look at it, I feel purple. Not sad-purple. Different-purple. Like—" Tenchi scrunched his face in concentration. "Like the tree is looking back."

Sheldon felt a chill that had nothing to do with the afternoon breeze. *The tree is looking back.* From the mouth of a four-year-old, it sounded like the simple imagination of childhood. But Sheldon had stood beneath that tree and felt its attention. Had watched its branches move against the wind.

Tenchi sensed things. Perhaps more than the adults around him realized.

"It's a very special tree," Sheldon said carefully.

"I know. Grandpa says it's sacred. That means important and old." Tenchi stuffed the drawings back into his bag. "Can we do the loud game now? You promised loud games."

"After your snack," Katsuhito interjected mildly. "Rea has something prepared."

"But—"

"Snack first. Then games. The order matters."

Tenchi made a face but didn't argue further. He climbed down from the engawa and headed toward the kitchen, his school bag bouncing against his back.

Sheldon watched him go, the drawing of the purple-feeling tree lingering in his mind.

"He draws what he sees," Katsuhito said quietly. "Or what he feels. The distinction is not always clear, with him."

"You've noticed."

"I have noticed many things about my grandson." Katsuhito's voice was carefully neutral. "He has good instincts. Unusual perceptions. Whether those will develop into something more, only time will tell."

"The tree. He said it looks back."

"He says many things. Some are imagination. Some are not." Katsuhito finished his tea and set the cup aside. "I tell you this so you understand: this household is not ordinary. The people in it are not ordinary. If you are going to stay, you should know that."

It was a warning, Sheldon realized. Or perhaps an invitation—a door being held open rather than closed.

"I'm not ordinary either," he said.

"No." Katsuhito's eyes met his, steady and assessing. "I did not think you were."

From the kitchen came the sound of Tenchi negotiating with Rea about the quantity and composition of his snack. The ordinary sounds of domestic life, layered over extraordinary depths.

"He has latched onto you," Katsuhito continued. "It happens sometimes—children form connections that cannot be explained by logic or proximity. He decided you were important before he knew anything about you. Before you knew anything about yourself, perhaps."

"Is that a concern?"

"It is a responsibility. He will give you everything—his trust, his heart, his endless questions. What you do with those gifts will shape him in ways that neither of you can predict." Katsuhito rose, the motion fluid and effortless. "I do not say this to frighten you. Only to ensure you understand what you are accepting."

"I understand."

"Good." The old man walked toward the kitchen, pausing at the door. "Then come. Snack first. Then you will discover what 'loud games' means to a four-year-old."

# Scene 2.11: The Carving Lesson (Setup)

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 16:00 - 17:30
**Location:** Engawa, overlooking courtyard
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon primary, Katsuhito secondary)
**Word Target:** 2,500

---

### SHELDON

The loud game, as it turned out, was tag.

Not ordinary tag—a complicated variant that Tenchi had apparently invented, involving "safe zones" (the stone lanterns), "power-ups" (jumping off things), and rules that seemed to change moment by moment based on whoever was currently losing. Sheldon spent twenty minutes chasing and being chased across the shrine courtyard, his reset body responding with a speed and agility that continually surprised him.

By the end, he was breathing hard and Tenchi was declaring victory based on criteria that remained mysteriously undefined.

"That was loud," Katsuhito observed from his position on the engawa, where he had watched the entire proceeding with evident amusement.

"You said you wanted loud games." Tenchi dropped onto the wooden platform, exhausted and triumphant. "Was that loud enough?"

"More than enough."

"Good." Tenchi flopped onto his back, staring up at the eaves. "I'm tired now. My legs feel like water."

"That's what running does."

"I know. I run a lot." A pause. "Sheldon-san runs good for someone who's old."

Sheldon, still catching his breath, chose not to address the "old" designation. At thirty—or the thirty his body now claimed to be—he was hardly ancient, but to a four-year-old, anyone past childhood probably looked the same.

Katsuhito rose and disappeared into the residence, returning a moment later with a wooden box under one arm. He settled back onto the engawa and opened it, revealing a collection of carving tools: several knives of different sizes, whetstones, blocks of pale wood, and something that looked like a leather strop.

"You mentioned wanting to learn," Katsuhito said. "Yesterday. For the blocks."

"I did." Sheldon moved to sit beside him, still slightly breathless. "I didn't expect to start so soon."

"Sooner is better than later. The hands must learn separately from the mind, and the hands need more time." He selected a knife—medium-sized, with a straight blade and a handle worn smooth by decades of use—and offered it to Sheldon. "This was my father's knife. I learned on it. So did my daughter."

The mention of his daughter—Kiyone, presumably—passed without emphasis, but Sheldon felt the weight of it. This knife had been held by a dead woman, who had learned from this man, who was now offering the knowledge to a stranger who had appeared from nowhere.

"I'll treat it with respect."

"I know you will." Katsuhito selected a block of wood from the box—pale, close-grained, about the size of a deck of cards. "We begin with cypress. It is forgiving. It shows where you have gone wrong without punishing too severely."

---

### KATSUHITO

The young man held the knife like someone who had held precision instruments before—not carving implements, but something similar. Scientific equipment, perhaps. Tools that required careful handling and steady hands.

Katsuhito demonstrated the first cut: a long shallow stroke along the grain, peeling away a thin ribbon of wood. The motion came from the shoulder, not the wrist—power controlled by the larger muscles, directed by the smaller ones.

"Feel the grain before you cut," he said. "The wood will tell you which way it wants to go. Your job is to listen."

Tsukino Sheldon—if that was truly his name—listened. Not just heard, but listened, the way Kiyone had listened when she was learning. The way Katsuhito himself had listened to his father, seven hundred years ago on a planet so distant that its light hadn't yet reached this world.

The first cut was clumsy. Too deep, fighting the grain rather than following it. The second was better. By the fifth, the motion was beginning to flow—not smoothly, not yet, but with the potential for smoothness.

"Good instincts," Katsuhito said. "You find the rhythm quickly."

"I'm used to learning physical skills." The young man's eyes were on the wood, watching how it responded to the blade. "The body learns faster than the mind sometimes."

"Always. The mind wants to understand before acting. The body simply acts, and understanding follows."

They worked in companionable silence for a while. Tenchi, recovered from his exhaustion, had moved to the courtyard to play with the wooden blocks that Kiyone had carved—the blocks that had prompted this whole exchange. He was building something elaborate and unsteady, muttering to himself about structural requirements.

"He speaks to himself when he builds," Tsukino said. Not a question; an observation.

"He narrates his thinking. Many children do. He has never stopped." Katsuhito watched his grandson with a mixture of pride and concern that he had long since learned to hide. "His mind works constantly. I sometimes wonder if he exhausts himself simply by thinking."

"There are worse faults."

"There are." Katsuhito adjusted Tsukino's grip on the knife—too tight, tension making the cuts jagged. "Relax the hand. Let the knife move. You are guiding, not forcing."

---

### SHELDON

The knife wanted to move in ways he hadn't expected.

Sheldon had spent his career working with abstractions—equations that described reality without ever touching it, symbols that stood in for forces and particles and the fundamental structure of existence. Even his experimental work had been mediated by instruments, data flowing through sensors and computers before reaching his understanding.

This was different. This was direct. The wood was here, solid and real, and his hands were changing it through immediate physical action. There was no distance between intention and result, no interface between his will and the world.

He found it terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure.

"You are thinking too much," Katsuhito said. "I can see it in your shoulders."

"I tend to think."

"This is not a thinking task. This is a feeling task." Katsuhito took the knife from his hands and made a series of quick cuts, transforming the rough block into something with the vague suggestion of shape. "See? I do not consider each stroke. The strokes come because the wood requires them. Your job is to see what the wood wants to become, and help it get there."

"How do you know what it wants to become?"

"You don't. Not at first. At first you make simple things—cubes, cylinders, basic shapes. As your hands learn, they begin to feel the possibilities. And eventually, you look at a piece of wood and you know what is hiding inside it, waiting to emerge."

The philosophy was familiar from other contexts. Michelangelo had supposedly said something similar about sculpture—freeing the figure trapped in the stone. Sheldon had always found such statements poetic but unhelpful. The marble didn't *want* to be David. The sculptor imposed that form through skill and vision.

But here, with the knife in his hands and the wood responding to his cuts, he began to understand what Katsuhito meant. The grain had a direction. The density varied in ways that affected how the blade moved. The wood *did* have preferences, patterns that emerged naturally when you stopped fighting and started listening.

"Try again," Katsuhito said, handing back the knife and a fresh block. "Make a cube. It sounds simple. It is not."

Sheldon began again. Cut, rotate, cut. The block's edges slowly becoming more defined, the surfaces more regular. His first attempt had been terrible—lopsided, gouged where the knife had slipped. His second was better. His third began to look like an actual geometric form.

Tenchi appeared at his elbow, watching the work with intense concentration.

"You're making a block!"

"Trying to."

"It doesn't look as good as Mom's blocks yet." The assessment was delivered without cruelty—simple honest observation. "But it's better than Grandpa's first block."

Katsuhito snorted. "Who told you about my first block?"

"Mom did. She said it looked like a potato."

"She was not wrong." The old man's voice was soft, touched with something that might have been grief or fondness or both. "My first block was terrible. My second was worse. My hundredth was almost acceptable."

"A hundred blocks?" Tenchi's eyes went wide. "That's so many."

"Learning takes time. Your mother carved hundreds of blocks before she made the ones you play with. Good work requires patience."

Tenchi considered this seriously. "I want to learn to carve too."

"When you are older."

"How much older?"

"Old enough to hold a knife safely."

"I can hold a knife safely now!"

"We will revisit this conversation when you are seven."

Tenchi made a face but subsided, returning to his own block construction in the courtyard. Sheldon watched him go, then looked down at the imperfect cube in his hands.

"You miss her," he said quietly. "Your daughter."

Katsuhito's hands stilled on the knife he'd been cleaning. A long moment passed before he answered.

"Every day. She was..." He paused, searching for words. "She was my second chance. After mistakes I had made earlier. She was proof that it was possible to do better." Another pause. "And now she is gone, and I am still here, and I do not know what that means."

"I'm sorry."

"Grief is not something to apologize for. It simply is." Katsuhito resumed cleaning the knife, his motions precise and unhurried. "She would have liked you, I think. She had a fondness for people who were more than they appeared."

The words landed with more weight than Katsuhito probably intended. *More than they appeared.* Did he know? Did he suspect? Or was it simply observation of the obvious—that Sheldon was hiding something, that his story didn't quite add up?

"I would have liked to meet her," Sheldon said.

"Perhaps you will. In a way." Katsuhito set the knife aside and looked at him directly. "Her spirit is in this place. In the blocks, the recipes, the way the household functions. In Tenchi, who has her stubbornness and her laughter. In Rea, who learned her duties from Kiyone's example. If you stay, you will come to know her through the marks she left behind."

It was a beautiful thought, and a sad one. The persistence of the dead through the living. The way presence could outlast the person who generated it.

Sheldon looked at the knife in his hand—the knife that had belonged to Katsuhito's father, that Kiyone had learned on, that now rested in his own unfamiliar fingers.

"I'll try to be worthy of that," he said.

"You already are. The trying is what makes it so."

# Scene 2.12: Evening Preparations

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 17:30 - 18:30
**Location:** Residence - kitchen
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 1,500

---

The kitchen transformed as evening approached.

Sheldon had offered to help, and Rea had accepted—not enthusiastically, but without the resistance he might have expected. She set him to work washing vegetables while she prepared the base for the evening's soup, their movements finding an awkward rhythm in the small space.

"The radish needs to be sliced thin," she said, not looking up from her own work. "For pickling. The barrel is in the corner—we add to it every few days."

Sheldon found the radish and the knife she indicated, setting to work with careful strokes. His hands were still adjusting from the afternoon's carving lesson, the muscles complaining at being asked to perform yet another unfamiliar task.

"You learned to cut today," Rea observed. "Masaki-sama's carving lesson."

"How did you know?"

"Your hands are favoring certain muscles. The carving grip is different from a kitchen grip." She glanced at his work and made a small adjustment to his technique. "Thinner. The brine doesn't penetrate thick slices properly."

He corrected his approach, and they worked in silence for several minutes. The kitchen sounds were homely and strange at once—the bubble of stock simmering, the scrape of knife against cutting board, the distant sound of Tenchi playing in another room.

"He was loud this afternoon," Rea said. "Tenchi. I could hear him from inside."

"Loud games. As requested."

"He will sleep well tonight." A pause. "He has not slept well since his mother died. The nights are difficult for him."

"He mentioned his mother. At breakfast. Casually."

"That is how he speaks of her. Casual mentions, as though she might walk through the door at any moment. The counselor says it is normal. That grief in children takes strange forms."

"There was a counselor?"

"Masaki-sama arranged it. After the funeral. Tenchi would not sleep, would not eat, would not play. He sat in his mother's room and waited for her to come back." Rea's voice remained level, but something moved beneath the surface. "The counselor helped him understand that she was not coming back. That missing someone was not the same as waiting for them."

Sheldon absorbed this. The small boy in the other room, so full of energy and questions, had sat in his dead mother's room and refused to eat. Had needed professional help to understand that death was final.

"He seems better now," Sheldon said carefully.

"He has good days and bad days. Today was good." Rea scraped her cutting board into a pot, efficient and precise. "You are part of that, I think. A new person to attach to. Someone who does not remind him of what he has lost."

"Is that healthy? Attaching to a stranger?"

Rea was quiet for a moment. Then: "I was a stranger once. He attached to me as well. Children love who they love. It is not always logical."

"And you? Did you attach to him?"

The question hung in the air. Sheldon watched Rea's profile—the careful composure, the slight tension in her shoulders. He had pushed past some invisible boundary, asked something too personal.

"I am not... good at attachment," she said finally. "I was not taught how. But Tenchi makes it easy. He gives so much that receiving feels natural." A pause. "If that makes sense."

"It does."

They returned to their work. The silence was different now—more comfortable, the air cleared by honesty.

"You are better at this than most guests," Rea said, watching him slice the radish. "Most guests want to be served. They do not offer to help."

"I prefer to be useful."

"That is unusual." She took the finished radish slices and began arranging them in the pickling barrel. "Most people prefer to be comfortable."

"Usefulness is its own comfort. Having something to do. Being needed for something."

Rea nodded slowly, something like recognition moving across her features. "Yes. That is true. I have found that as well."

Tenchi's voice drifted from the other room—a nonsense song he was singing to himself, something about a frog and a princess and a mountain made of rice. The words were barely coherent but the melody was surprisingly complex, rising and falling in patterns that seemed improvised but somehow right.

"He makes songs," Rea said. "All the time. About everything. Masaki-sama says his mother was the same."

"Musical family?"

"I do not know about music. But they both... see the world as something to be narrated. As though speaking it makes it more real." She finished with the radish and moved to the next task. "It is tiring sometimes. But also..."

"Also?"

She didn't finish the sentence. But her face softened slightly, and Sheldon understood: also, it was something she had learned to love.

The evening meal took shape around them. Rice steamed in the cooker. Soup bubbled on the stove. Fish waited to be grilled at the last minute. Sheldon learned the locations of things—the bowls stored here, the chopsticks there, the particular arrangement that made the small kitchen function efficiently.

By the time Katsuhito appeared to announce that the shrine's evening duties were complete, the table was nearly set. Tenchi was extracted from his game and subjected to a quick washing of hands and face. The household gathered, as it had the night before and presumably would again tomorrow, to share the evening meal.

Sheldon took his place at the low table and felt, for the first time, like he might actually belong there.

# Scene 2.13: Second Dinner

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 18:30 - 19:30
**Location:** Dining area
**POV:** Multi (Sheldon/Tenchi/Katsuhito)
**Word Target:** 2,000

### SHELDON

The second dinner was different from the first.

Not in the food—that was nearly identical, the same simple fare that seemed to define this household—but in the atmosphere. Last night, Sheldon had been a stranger at the table, an unknown quantity being cautiously assessed. Tonight, something had shifted. The silences were easier. The glances less evaluating.

He had worked alongside them for a day. Had swept their courtyard and helped prepare their meal and played loud games with their child. The work had purchased something that words alone could not: a place at the table that felt earned rather than granted.

"Sheldon-san made a cube," Tenchi announced, between bites of rice. "It's lumpy but he's getting better. Grandpa says everyone's first cube is lumpy."

"Mine was lumpy," Katsuhito confirmed. "Like a potato."

"You keep saying that." Tenchi grinned. "I like imagining Grandpa making potato blocks."

"It was a humbling experience. Humility is important."

"What's humility?"

"Knowing that you are not as skilled as you would like to be, and being willing to learn."

Tenchi processed this. "So Sheldon-san is humble? Because his cube is lumpy?"

"Sheldon-san is learning. That is what matters." Katsuhito's eyes found Sheldon's across the table, warmth in their depths. "The cube will improve. The willingness to learn will serve him longer than any single skill."

The conversation shifted, as conversations did, to other matters. Tenchi's school day, described in elaborate detail that Sheldon suspected was at least partially invented. The summer festival that Katsuhito had discussed with the village council. The weather, which someone had apparently predicted would turn rainy by the end of the week.

"The roof," Rea said quietly, the first words she had contributed since the meal began.

"Yes." Katsuhito nodded. "I will speak with Tanaka-san tomorrow. He should assess the damage before the rain arrives."

"I can meet with him," Sheldon offered. "It's my house. My responsibility."

"You know nothing about roofs."

"I know nothing about carving either. I'm learning."

A pause. Then Katsuhito smiled—the expression rare enough that Sheldon had begun to track its appearances.

"Very well. I will arrange the introduction. You will meet with Tanaka-san together, and he will explain what needs to be done."

"Thank you."

---

### TENCHI

The food was good, like always, but Tenchi was having trouble concentrating on eating.

His brain kept thinking about other things. The cube that Sheldon-san had made—lumpy, like Grandpa said, but *real*, an actual thing that hadn't existed before and now did. The loud game they had played, running all over the courtyard until his legs felt like water. The mockingbird that Sheldon-san had described, the bird that could copy other birds' songs.

And most importantly: Daddy was coming.

"Grandpa," he said, interrupting whatever the grown-ups were talking about. "Is Daddy coming this weekend?"

A small silence. Grandpa's face did that thing it did sometimes, where it got careful and still.

"Yes. Saturday morning. He will stay until Sunday evening."

"Can I tell him about Sheldon-san? About the loud games and the mockingbirds and the purple tree?"

"You may tell him whatever you like."

"Good." Tenchi returned to his rice, satisfied. "Daddy will like Sheldon-san. I'm sure of it."

"Oh?" Grandpa's voice had that tone—the one that meant he was curious but pretending not to be. "Why are you sure?"

"Because Sheldon-san is nice and he keeps his promises and he runs good for someone old." Tenchi considered. "Also he listens when I talk. Daddy sometimes doesn't listen because he's tired. But Sheldon-san listened about the mockingbirds even though they're just birds."

"Mockingbirds are not 'just birds,'" Sheldon-san said. "They're remarkable creatures."

"See?" Tenchi pointed at him with his chopsticks, earning a gentle correction from Rea-nee-san about table manners. "He thinks birds are important. Daddy thinks birds are just birds."

"Your father has many things on his mind," Grandpa said. "His work is demanding."

"I know." Tenchi didn't like thinking about Daddy's work. It was the thing that took Daddy away, that made him too tired to listen sometimes, that had kept him from coming for Tenchi's birthday. "But Sheldon-san will still be here when Daddy comes, right?"

"I'll be here," Sheldon-san said. "I'm staying at least until my house is fixed."

"And then you'll live in your house but you can visit every day because your house is close."

"That's the plan."

"Good." Tenchi returned to his rice, the world properly ordered. "Then Daddy can meet you and see that you're nice and maybe he'll be less tired because there's more people to help."

The grown-ups did that thing where they looked at each other over Tenchi's head, having a conversation without words. Tenchi ignored them. Grown-ups were always having silent conversations. It was one of the things they did instead of just saying things out loud like normal people.

---

### SHELDON

The meal concluded with tea and small pickled plums, the tart sweetness cutting through the heaviness of the rice. Tenchi had been sent to put away his school supplies—a task he was apparently supposed to have done hours ago—leaving the adults in momentary peace.

"Nobuyuki arrives Saturday morning," Katsuhito said. "He works in the city. Architecture. He can only visit on weekends."

"Tenchi mentioned him. His father."

"His father. My son-in-law. A good man, in his way, though not built for grief. He has... struggled, since Kiyone died."

Sheldon heard the careful phrasing, the weight of unspoken complications. "Struggled how?"

"He buries himself in work. It is his way of coping. Unfortunately, it means Tenchi sees less of him than either of them would like." Katsuhito finished his tea and set the cup aside. "I do not fault him. Grief takes many forms. But Tenchi is too young to understand why his father is absent, and too perceptive to believe comfortable lies."

"The broken birthday promise."

"Yes. That was... difficult. Nobuyuki wanted to come. A project deadline prevented it. Tenchi understood intellectually but felt abandoned nonetheless." Katsuhito's voice was heavy. "I have tried to fill the gaps, but I am old, and I am not his father."

"You're doing well. From what I can see."

"I am doing what I can. Which is different from doing well." The old man rose, his movements slightly less fluid than usual—tiredness, perhaps, or the accumulated weight of the day. "He has latched onto you. You saw how he asked whether you would still be here. The attachment is forming faster than I anticipated."

"Is that a problem?"

"It is a responsibility. As I said." Katsuhito moved toward the kitchen, pausing at the door. "Nobuyuki will have questions. About you, about your presence here. I have not yet decided what to tell him."

"The truth?"

"Which truth? The one in your documents, or the one in your eyes?" A slight smile softened the words. "I do not ask you to explain yourself, Tsukino-san. But Nobuyuki is perceptive in his own way, and he is protective of his son. Be prepared for scrutiny."

He disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Sheldon alone at the table with the remnants of the meal and the echoes of warning.

Another meeting approaching. Another set of questions to navigate. Another layer of this household to understand.

He began gathering dishes, carrying them toward the kitchen where Rea was already running water for washing.

The work helped. It always did.

# Scene 2.14: Evening on the Engawa

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 19:30 - 20:30
**Location:** Engawa
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 1,800

---

The sky softened to purple and gold as the sun descended behind the mountains.

Sheldon sat on the engawa with Katsuhito, their tea cups warm in their hands, watching the light change across the shrine grounds. Tenchi played in the courtyard below, building something elaborate with his wooden blocks, muttering the narrative of his construction to himself.

"This place is beautiful," Sheldon said. "I keep noticing it."

"Beauty is one of its qualities. Others are less obvious." Katsuhito sipped his tea, his eyes on the horizon. "The shrine has stood here for seven hundred years. In that time, many things have happened. Not all of them visible to casual observation."

"Like the cave."

"Like the cave. And other things." The old man's voice was contemplative. "Every place has its layers. History accumulates like sediment. What you see on the surface is only the beginning."

Stars were beginning to emerge, one by one, in the darkening sky. Sheldon found himself tracking them—familiar constellations, the same patterns he had known in Alaska and Georgia and everywhere else he had lived. The Milky Way was brighter here than in Fairbanks, away from even the modest light pollution of the university campus.

"The stars are the same," he said, the observation escaping before he could consider its implications.

Katsuhito glanced at him. "The same as what?"

"As... everywhere. I've traveled a fair amount. The stars are always the same, no matter where you go."

"Ah." The old man returned his gaze to the sky. "Yes. That is one of the comforts of existence. The sky above remains constant while the world below changes."

They sat in companionable silence, watching the stars emerge. In the courtyard, Tenchi had finished his construction and was now reenacting some kind of drama with the blocks as actors, providing voices for each character.

"He has an imagination," Sheldon observed.

"He has his mother's gift for narrative. Kiyone could spin stories from nothing—elaborate tales with beginnings and middles and ends, conjured out of thin air." Katsuhito's voice was soft with memory. "I would listen to her tell Tenchi his bedtime stories and wonder where she found them all. The answer, I think, was that she did not find them. She created them, moment by moment, as naturally as breathing."

"A valuable gift."

"All gifts are valuable. And all gifts have costs." The old man set down his tea and turned slightly, regarding Sheldon with that assessing gaze. "You have gifts as well. I have seen them today. The way you learn. The way you observe. The way you think in systems and patterns."

"Physics," Sheldon said. "That's what it's trained for."

"Physics is one application. But the underlying capability is older than physics. Older than science itself." Katsuhito paused. "Some people are born to see patterns that others miss. To understand connections that remain invisible to most. It is a rare thing, and a dangerous one."

"Dangerous?"

"Seeing too much can be a burden. Understanding too clearly can isolate you from others who do not understand." The old man's voice was gentle but weighted. "I have lived a long time, Tsukino-san. I have met many pattern-seers. Not all of them found happiness with their gifts."

Sheldon considered this. His career had been built on pattern-recognition—finding the mathematical structures beneath observed reality, tracing the invisible connections that governed how the universe behaved. It had brought him professional success and intellectual satisfaction.

It had also brought loneliness. Hours spent in his own head while the world continued without him. Relationships that foundered on his inability to engage with things that seemed trivial. A life that had been, in the end, more thought than lived.

"I understand what you're saying," he said.

"I thought you might." Katsuhito picked up his tea again, the conversation apparently complete. "The shrine has room for pattern-seers. This place has attracted them before. But balance matters. The mind must not consume the heart."

In the courtyard, Tenchi had abandoned his blocks and was now attempting to catch fireflies—the first few had emerged in the gathering dusk, their yellow-green lights blinking in the shadows beneath the trees.

"Uncle Sheldon! Look! Fireflies!"

The title landed unexpectedly. Uncle. The boy had promoted him without asking permission, assigning a familial role that had no basis in biology or documentation.

Sheldon looked at Katsuhito, uncertain how to respond.

"He has decided," the old man said simply. "Children's decisions are often wiser than adults'."

"Uncle," Sheldon repeated.

"It is what Nobuyuki is to him. Uncle is the category for trusted adult males who are not Grandpa and not Daddy." Katsuhito smiled slightly. "You could correct him. But I would advise against it."

Sheldon rose and walked to the edge of the engawa. In the courtyard, Tenchi was cupping something in his hands, peering at the soft light that glowed between his fingers.

"I caught one! Come see!"

Sheldon descended from the veranda and crossed to where the boy stood. The firefly in Tenchi's hands blinked patiently, apparently untroubled by its capture.

"Beautiful," Sheldon said.

"They make light from their *bodies*." Tenchi's voice was hushed with wonder. "How do they do that?"

"A chemical reaction. Something in their bodies creates light when it mixes together."

"Magic?"

"Chemistry. Which is a kind of magic, if you look at it the right way."

Tenchi considered this. Then he opened his hands, releasing the firefly into the evening air. They watched it rise, blinking, until it joined its companions in the shadows beneath the trees.

"I like chemistry-magic," Tenchi decided. "Better than regular magic. Because regular magic isn't real, but chemistry-magic is."

Sheldon thought of the flowers that had changed in his hands, the exhaustion that had followed something he couldn't explain. Regular magic might be more real than Tenchi knew.

But that was not a conversation for tonight.

"Ready for bed?" he asked instead.

"No." But Tenchi's yawn betrayed him. "Maybe. Soon."

They walked together back toward the engawa, where Katsuhito waited with patient eyes and tea growing cold.

Above them, the stars burned on, unchanging, while below them the world continued its endless work of change.

# Scene 2.15: Tenchi's Bedtime

**Time:** 20:30 - 21:00
**Location:** Residence hallway → Tenchi's room
**POV:** Sheldon (observing)
**Word Target:** 1,200

---

The bedtime routine had a choreography that Sheldon was beginning to recognize.

Rea appeared as if summoned, her timing precise—the moment the light dropped below a certain threshold, the moment Tenchi's yawns became too frequent to ignore. She collected the boy from the engawa with gentle efficiency, steering him toward the bathroom for the evening wash.

"I'm not tired," Tenchi protested, even as another yawn overtook him. "I could stay up longer. I could catch more fireflies."

"The fireflies will be there tomorrow," Rea said. "Sleep will not wait."

"Sleep should wait. I should be in charge of when I sleep."

"Perhaps when you are older."

"How much older?"

"Old enough to understand why sleep matters."

Their voices faded down the hallway, leaving Sheldon alone with Katsuhito on the veranda. The old man made no move to follow; apparently the bedtime routine was Rea's domain.

"She handles him well," Sheldon observed.

"She has learned his rhythms. It took time." Katsuhito rose and stretched, his joints making small sounds of protest. "He resisted her at first. She was not his mother, and he wanted his mother. But persistence and patience won out eventually."

"Three years."

"Three years of daily work. Small kindnesses accumulating until they became invisible. Now she is simply part of his world." A pause. "That is how family is built, sometimes. Not through blood but through presence."

From somewhere in the residence, the sound of water running. Tenchi's voice raised in some elaborate explanation of why he should be allowed to skip washing behind his ears. Rea's response, patient and unmoved.

"Go," Katsuhito said. "Say goodnight. He will want you to."

Sheldon hesitated. "I don't want to intrude."

"It is not intrusion when you are invited. And you are invited—by him, if not by anyone else." The old man smiled. "He has claimed you, Tsukino-san. Best to accept it gracefully."

Sheldon walked through the residence toward the sound of voices. The hallway was dimly lit, oil lamps casting warm shadows on the wooden walls. He found Tenchi's room—the shoji partially open, revealing Rea helping the boy into his sleeping clothes.

"Uncle Sheldon!" Tenchi spotted him immediately. "You came to say goodnight!"

"I did."

"Good. Because goodnight from people you like is better than goodnight from nobody." Tenchi struggled into his yukata, his arms tangling briefly before Rea smoothed them into the correct sleeves. "Rea-nee-san says goodnight every night and Grandpa says goodnight but now you can say goodnight too."

"Then goodnight."

"Not yet! I'm not in bed yet. You have to wait until I'm in bed and then say it properly." Tenchi scrambled across the room and dove into his futon, pulling the blanket up to his chin. "Okay. Now."

Sheldon approached the doorway. The room was small and neat—tatami floors, a low desk in one corner, shelves holding books and toys. A small shrine occupied an alcove, and on it sat a photograph in a simple frame. Even from the doorway, Sheldon could recognize Kiyone's features: Tenchi's mother, watching over her son's sleep.

"Goodnight, Tenchi."

"Goodnight, Uncle Sheldon." The boy's eyes were already heavy, the day's activities finally catching up with him. "Will you be here tomorrow?"

"I'll be here tomorrow."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

"Okay." Tenchi's eyes closed, then struggled open again. "Will you tell me more about America tomorrow? About the mockingbirds and the breakfast cake?"

"If you want."

"I want." Another yawn, enormous, consuming half his face. "I want to know everything about everywhere. That's what Grandpa says. That I want to know too much."

"There's no such thing as wanting to know too much."

Tenchi smiled at that, pleased by the validation. His eyes closed again, and this time they didn't reopen. His breathing was already slowing, deepening, the transition to sleep happening with the speed that only children could manage.

Rea straightened his blanket and adjusted the pillow, small movements that spoke of long practice. Then she rose and moved past Sheldon into the hallway, sliding the shoji most of the way closed behind her.

"He likes you," she said quietly.

"He likes everyone."

"No." Rea's eyes met his in the dim light. "He is friendly with everyone. Liking is different. You he *likes*."

"How can you tell?"

"The way he talks to you. The questions he asks. The way he watches when you're not looking." She began walking toward the kitchen, expecting him to follow. "Children are honest in ways adults forget how to be. When Tenchi likes someone, it is obvious. When he does not, that is also obvious."

"And me?"

"You are obvious." A slight pause. "In a good way."

They reached the kitchen, where dishes from the evening meal still waited to be put away. Rea began the work automatically, her movements precise and efficient.

"I'll help," Sheldon said.

"You helped before dinner."

"I can help after, too."

She handed him a cloth without comment, and they worked together in companionable silence, putting the kitchen to rights while the household settled toward sleep.

# Scene 2.16: Night Reflections

**Day:** 2 (April 4, 1989)
**Time:** 21:00 - 21:30
**Location:** Guest room
**POV:** Sheldon
**Word Target:** 1,500

---

The guest room was as he had left it that morning.

Sheldon stood in the doorway for a moment, taking in the details: the futon laid out in the same position, the small bag of supplies from Haruna's store in the corner, the scroll on the wall that could mean patience or endurance. The window shutter was closed, but thin lines of moonlight leaked through the gaps, painting silver stripes across the tatami.

He had survived his first full day in this new existence.

The thought arrived without fanfare, a simple acknowledgment of fact. Twenty-four hours ago, he had been sitting in this same room, exhausted and overwhelmed and uncertain whether any of this was real. Now he was tired from physical work, full from a shared meal, and carrying the weight of a four-year-old's trust in his hands.

Progress, of a kind.

He changed into the sleeping clothes Rea had provided—simple cotton, worn soft by many washings—and knelt beside his bag to retrieve his toothbrush. The motions were automatic, the small rituals of ending a day that remained the same regardless of which world he woke up in.

Tomorrow there would be more. The meeting with Tanaka about the roof. Another lesson in carving, perhaps. More questions from Tenchi, more quiet conversations with Katsuhito, more of the careful dance of integration into a household that was slowly making room for him.

And Saturday, Nobuyuki would arrive.

The thought brought a knot of something—anxiety, perhaps, or simply the awareness of an approaching challenge. Nobuyuki was Tenchi's father. His judgment mattered in ways that Katsuhito's and Rea's did not. If Nobuyuki decided that Sheldon was a threat, or a bad influence, or simply unwelcome, the careful place Sheldon was building could collapse.

But that was Saturday's problem. Tonight's problem was simpler: sleep, and then another day.

He finished his preparations and crossed to the futon, settling into its familiar-unfamiliar embrace. The tatami smelled of dry grass and old wood. The blanket held the scent of cedar from its storage. His body, tired from the day's work, welcomed the horizontal position with palpable relief.

He should meditate on what he had learned. Catalogue the information he had gathered. Plan his approach to the challenges ahead.

Instead, he lay in the darkness and listened to the shrine settling around him.

Small sounds, barely audible. The creak of wooden beams adjusting to the cooling night air. The distant call of an owl in the forest. The soft rhythm of the household breathing—not literally, but metaphorically, the collective pulse of a place where people lived and slept and dreamed.

He had lived alone for so long. The silence of his Fairbanks apartment had been absolute, broken only by mechanical sounds: the heating system, the refrigerator, the hum of electronics. There had been no other breathing, no small sounds of other lives unfolding nearby.

This was different. This was fullness where before there had been emptiness.

The guest room door squeaked slightly, shifting in its frame—not opening, just settling—and Sheldon smiled in the darkness. The door that announced all comings and goings. Katsuhito's early warning system, deliberately unmaintained.

He was learning the language of this place. The patterns beneath the surface. The systems that made it function.

Perhaps that was all he could do, for now. Learn, and help, and try to be worthy of the trust that was being extended to him. The larger questions—why he was here, what power had placed him, what purpose he was meant to serve—those could wait. They would have to wait, because he had no way to answer them.

But the immediate tasks were clear. Fix the roof. Restore the garden. Learn to carve blocks for a boy who had lost his mother. Build a life from the materials available, and see what emerged.

Sleep was pulling at him, a tide he no longer had strength to resist. His eyes closed, and the darkness behind his eyelids was the same as the darkness around him.

His last coherent thought was of the great tree, standing patient in the moonlight, its branches reaching toward the stars.

Then sleep took him, and the second day ended.

---

Somewhere outside, the tree rustled in a wind that touched nothing else. Its branches shifted, adjusted, resettled—subtle movements that would have been invisible to any observer, but were no less real for their invisibility.

It was watching.

It would continue to watch.

And in the guest room, a man who was not quite the man he had been slept peacefully, dreaming of patterns and stars and the simple pleasure of belonging somewhere, finally, after a very long time alone.
