---

# OVERVIEW

The eight years between the revelations (Year 4-5) and canon (Year 13) are the quiet heart of the story. Training deepens. Tenchi grows. Relationships mature. The foundation built in Years 1-3 becomes unshakeable.

**Timeline Context:**
- Year 5 = April 1993 - March 1994 (Tenchi age 8-9, Elementary 3rd grade)
- Year 12 = April 2000 - March 2001 (Tenchi age 15-16, High School 1st year)
- Phase II abilities throughout (subtle supernatural, controlled)
- Key revelations: Year 4 (to Yosho), Year 5 (to Tenchi), Year 9-10 (Yosho's true form to Sheldon)

---

# PART 1: YEAR 5 (1993) — THE SECOND REVELATION

## 1.1 — The Tenchi Revelation

**Timing:** Early Summer 1993 (detailed in separate document)

**Summary:**
- Sheldon caught in dark kitchen
- Chooses honesty over continued deception
- Tells Tenchi age-appropriate truth
- "I'm different. I can do things others can't."
- Tenchi accepts; feels included, not frightened

## 1.2 — Post-Revelation Changes

**Immediate:**
- Tenchi can watch some morning training
- Sheldon relaxes ability suppression at home
- Shared secret creates deeper bond
- Three people now know: Yosho, Sheldon, Tenchi

**Training Inclusion:**

Tenchi begins observing training sessions:
- Not participating — too young physically
- Learning what discipline looks like
- Understanding that Grandpa and Sheru-ji share something special
- This lays groundwork for his own sword training

---

# PART 2: YEAR 6 (1994) — THE CHOICE YEAR

## 2.1 — Nobuyuki's Offer

Nobuyuki's company offers a Tokyo position. Better money. Career advancement. But it would mean Tenchi leaving the shrine.

**The Offer:**

> "Tenchi, what if you came to live with me in Tokyo?"

**Tenchi's Response (age 9-10):**

> "Dad... I love you. But the shrine is my home. Grandpa and Sheru-ji are there."

**The Decision:**

> "I want to stay at the shrine."

Nobuyuki is heartbroken but understanding. Sheldon stays neutral throughout — this is their decision.

## 2.2 — Sword Training Intensifies

After Tenchi chooses the shrine, Katsuhito formalizes his training:

> "If you are to be a child of this shrine, you will learn its ways properly."

**What This Means:**
- Regular kendo practice (not just observation)
- Shrine ritual instruction
- Physical conditioning
- Discipline and patience training

---

# PART 3: YEAR 7 (1995) — THE MOTHER QUESTION

## 3.1 — The Question

A quiet evening. Tenchi has been pensive.

> "Sheru-ji... what was my mom like?"

**The Problem:** Sheldon never met Kiyone Masaki.

**Sheldon's Response:**

Honesty about his limitations:

> "I never met her, Tenchi. I wish I had. But I can tell you what I know."

He shares what he's learned from others, then redirects:

> "But you know who could tell you more? Your dad. And your grandpa."

This prompts Tenchi to finally have those conversations — with Nobuyuki (tearful, healing) and Katsuhito (measured, some truth shared).

## 3.2 — Historical Context

**1995 Events:**
- Great Hanshin Earthquake (January 17) — 6,400+ deaths
- Aum Shinrikyo sarin attack (March 20)
- National trauma year for Japan

The household helps Tenchi process news coverage of disaster.

---

# PART 4: YEARS 8-9 (1996-1997) — EARLY ADOLESCENCE

## 4.1 — Year 8 (1996): Pre-Adolescence

**Tenchi's Age:** 11-12 (Elementary 6th grade — final year)

**Physical Changes:**
- Growth spurt beginning
- Voice changes approaching
- Pre-teen moodiness emerging

**Key Moment:**

Tenchi, frustrated after a training session:
> "Why do I have to keep doing this? It's hard!"

Sheldon:
> "Because hard things build strong people. And because one day, you might need to protect someone you love."

## 4.2 — Year 9 (1997): Middle School Transition

**Tenchi's Age:** 12-13 (Middle School 1st year)

**The Change:**
- New school (town, not village)
- Longer commute
- More demanding academics
- Less time at home

**Natural Growing Apart:**

Tenchi spends more time at school, with school friends, on homework. Less time following Sheldon around.

This is developmentally appropriate. Sheldon reminds himself of this constantly.

> (Sheldon to Yosho) "He doesn't need me as much."

> (Yosho) "He will always need you. The form of need changes. That is growth."

# PART 5: YEAR 9-10 — YOSHO'S TRUE FORM REVEAL

## 5.1 — The Buildup

By Year 9-10, Sheldon has suspected for years that Katsuhito is more than he appears. The imbalance is uncomfortable — Sheldon has shared his truth, but Katsuhito maintains his mask.

## 5.2 — The Moment

**Setting:** A quiet evening. Tenchi is staying overnight at a friend's house. They are alone.

During a training session, Katsuhito moves — really moves. A strike that no elderly human could execute.

Sheldon doesn't pretend he didn't see.

> "You don't have to hide from me. I've known for years that you're not what you appear."

Long silence.

> "Would you like to see who I really am?"

> "Yes."

## 5.3 — The Transformation

The illusion drops.

Katsuhito — hunched, weathered, careful — becomes Yosho — young, powerful, beautiful.

Purple hair. Sharp features. Eyes that have seen seven centuries.

Sheldon's response:
> "...You're younger than I expected."

Yosho laughs. First genuine laugh Sheldon has heard from him.

## 5.4 — What Yosho Shares

- His true name (Yosho Masaki Jurai)
- His origin (Crown Prince of Jurai)
- His age (~700 years)
- Why he came to Earth (pursued Ryoko)
- Why he stayed (chose Earth over Jurai)

**What He Doesn't Share Yet:**
- Full details about Ryoko
- The cave's contents
- Tenchi's heritage specifically

## 5.5 — The New Dynamic

Sheldon is now the only person on Earth who sees Yosho's true face. This creates a level of intimacy neither anticipated.

Not romantic. Not yet. But... something is shifting.

# PART 6: YEARS 10-12 (1998-2000) — FINAL QUIET YEARS

## 6.1 — Year 10 (1998): Deepening

**Tenchi's Age:** 13-14 (Middle School 2nd year)

Adolescence is in full swing. Tenchi is curious about grandfather's past, asks pointed questions. Katsuhito deflects; Sheldon supports the deflection.

**Key Conversation:**

Tenchi:
> "Grandpa, how old are you really?"

Katsuhito:
> "Old enough to know that some questions answer themselves in time."

## 6.2 — Year 11 (1999): Calm Before Storm

**Tenchi's Age:** 14-15 (Middle School 3rd year)

**High School Entrance Exams:**
- Major stress
- Sheldon helps with studying
- Tenchi accepted to local high school

**Yosho's Behavior:**

Increasingly pensive. He knows what's coming.
- More training for Tenchi (subtle preparation)
- Occasional comments: "Soon things will change."

## 6.3 — Year 12 (2000): Final Year of Normal

**Tenchi's Age:** 15-16 (High School 1st year)

**Training Peak:**
- Tenchi at highest pre-canon level
- Could compete in kendo tournaments (doesn't — avoids attention)

**Atmosphere:**

Everyone can feel it. Something is coming.
- The lake seems more present
- The cave draws more attention
- Tension without source

**End of Year 12:**

The last "normal" spring. Cherry blossoms. High school continues.

Whatever comes next, they face it together.

The quiet years weren't filler. They were foundation.
