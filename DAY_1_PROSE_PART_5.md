# SON OF COSMOS — DAY 1 PROSE
## April 3, 1989 (Monday)
### Part 5: Scenes 201-250

**POV:** Sheldon (exclusive)  
**Timeline:** 16:16:32 JST — 18:30:00 JST  
**Coverage:** Meeting Tenchi continued → Shrine Tour → Tsukino House Introduction

---

## SCENE 201
**Time:** 16:16:49 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

He returned the greeting with a slight bow from his seated position.

"Thank you, Tenchi-kun. It's nice to meet you."

The boy's eyes narrowed slightly—not suspicion, but evaluation. A four-year-old's assessment of whether an adult was worth his time.

Whatever criteria Tenchi used, Sheldon apparently passed.

---

## SCENE 202
**Time:** 16:17:06 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"You talk funny," Tenchi announced.

Katsuhito made a small sound—not quite a laugh, not quite a cough. The old man's eyes glittered with amusement behind his glasses.

"My Japanese comes from Kyoto," Sheldon explained. "It sounds different from how people speak here."

---

## SCENE 203
**Time:** 16:17:23 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Kyoto is far away," Tenchi said, processing this information. "Ojii-chan showed me on a map. You have to take a train."

"That's right."

"Did you take a train?"

"Today I took a bus." The simpler answer, the true one for this day at least.

---

## SCENE 204
**Time:** 16:17:40 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

Tenchi crossed the room with the confident stride of someone who owned the space.

He stopped beside the table, close enough that Sheldon could smell the particular combination of child—grass stains and chalk dust and the faint sweetness of whatever snack he'd had at school.

"Can I see your hands?"

---

## SCENE 205
**Time:** 16:17:57 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The request was unexpected.

He held out his hands, palms up, unsure what the boy was looking for. Tenchi studied them with the intensity of a scientist examining specimens.

"They're big," Tenchi concluded. "Bigger than Ojii-chan's."

"I suppose they are."

---

## SCENE 206
**Time:** 16:18:14 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Can you catch bugs with hands that big?"

The question came from genuine curiosity. Not testing, not mocking. A child wanting to know the capabilities of this new person in his world.

"I've never tried," Sheldon admitted. "What kind of bugs?"

---

## SCENE 207
**Time:** 16:18:31 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Beetles." Tenchi's face brightened at the topic. "There are rhinoceros beetles on the mountain in summer. Ojii-chan helps me catch them. You need fast hands."

"I'll have to practice," Sheldon said gravely.

The gravity earned him a small smile from the boy. First success of the day.

---

## SCENE 208
**Time:** 16:18:48 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Tenchi," Katsuhito interjected gently, "Tsukino-san has had a long journey. Perhaps save the beetle questions for another day."

The boy's attention shifted to his grandfather, then back to Sheldon.

"Will you be here tomorrow?"

---

## SCENE 209
**Time:** 16:19:05 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

Would he be here tomorrow?

The question assumed permanence. Continuity. The kind of daily existence he couldn't promise because he didn't understand the terms of his new life.

"I plan to be," he said carefully.

"Good." Tenchi nodded with satisfaction. "Tomorrow I'll show you where the beetles live."

---

## SCENE 210
**Time:** 16:19:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The boy collected a cushion from the stack and placed it beside his grandfather.

His movements were practiced—this was his spot, his routine, his place in the afternoon rhythm of shrine life. He settled into seiza without apparent discomfort, the flexibility of youth making the position easy.

---

## SCENE 211
**Time:** 16:19:39 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"How was school?" Katsuhito asked, pouring a small cup of tea for his grandson.

"Takeshi-kun brought a snake." Tenchi accepted the tea with both hands, mimicking adult formality. "A small one. The teacher screamed."

"Did she?" Katsuhito's voice remained level, but amusement lurked beneath.

"Very loud."

---

## SCENE 212
**Time:** 16:19:56 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

The domestic exchange continued—small reports of the day, minor adventures, the details that constituted a four-year-old's universe.

He listened without intruding, watching the relationship unfold. Grandfather and grandson. The only family Tenchi had, apparently—no mention of parents, no photos visible in this room.

He wondered but didn't ask.

---

## SCENE 213
**Time:** 16:22:13 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Tsukino-san," Katsuhito said eventually, "would you like to see the grounds before we walk to the house? The light will fade soon, but there's time."

A tour. An opportunity to understand this place that had claimed him.

"I would appreciate that."

---

## SCENE 214
**Time:** 16:22:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, tea room

"Tenchi, would you like to show our guest around?"

The boy's face lit with importance. A task. Responsibility. The chance to be the one who knew things.

"Yes! Come on, I'll show you everything."

He was already moving toward the door before Sheldon could stand.

---

## SCENE 215
**Time:** 16:22:47 JST  
**Location:** Shrine main building, exiting

He rose from the cushion, his legs protesting the shift from kneeling to standing.

The body handled it better than his old one would have—no sharp pain, no extended recovery time—but the movement still registered. He'd been sitting for nearly half an hour.

Tenchi waited at the door with visible impatience.

---

## SCENE 216
**Time:** 16:23:04 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, beginning tour

The afternoon had deepened while they talked.

Shadows stretched longer now, the sun descending toward the western hills. The quality of light had shifted from bright to golden, softening edges, warming colors. Perhaps two hours until sunset.

Tenchi led the way across the shrine grounds.

---

## SCENE 217
**Time:** 16:23:21 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main hall

"This is where Ojii-chan does his work," Tenchi announced, gesturing at the main hall. "People come to pray and he helps them."

"What kind of help?"

"I don't know." The admission came without embarrassment. "Grown-up stuff."

---

## SCENE 218
**Time:** 16:23:38 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, main hall exterior

The main hall's architecture revealed itself more clearly in the late light.

Traditional construction, yes, but meticulously maintained. The wood showed no rot, no weathering beyond the acceptable patina of age. Someone—Katsuhito, presumably—had invested decades in preserving this building.

---

## SCENE 219
**Time:** 16:23:55 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approaching smaller building

"That's where we live." Tenchi pointed to a building set back from the main hall, connected by a covered walkway. "Ojii-chan and me. There's a kitchen and a room with the TV."

A residence. Attached to the shrine but separate from its sacred functions.

---

## SCENE 220
**Time:** 16:24:12 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, viewing residence

"Just the two of you?" he asked carefully.

"Mm." Tenchi's voice carried no weight of loss. "Papa lives in the city. He works."

Nobuyuki. The father Katsuhito hadn't mentioned. Working in the city while his son lived at a mountain shrine.

He didn't pursue the topic.

---

## SCENE 221
**Time:** 16:24:29 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, moving toward forest edge

"This way," Tenchi commanded, veering toward the forest edge.

Katsuhito followed at a distance, his pace unhurried, allowing the boy to lead while maintaining quiet supervision. A practiced dynamic—independence within boundaries.

---

## SCENE 222
**Time:** 16:24:46 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, forest edge

The great tree loomed larger as they approached.

He'd noticed it before, glimpsed from the tea room, but proximity revealed its true scale. The trunk was massive—not the widest he'd ever seen, but carrying a presence that exceeded mere measurement.

---

## SCENE 223
**Time:** 16:25:03 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near the great tree

"That's the big tree," Tenchi said, his voice dropping slightly. "We're not supposed to climb it."

"Why not?"

"Ojii-chan says it's special." The word carried weight, the particular emphasis children gave to concepts they didn't fully understand but knew were important.

---

## SCENE 224
**Time:** 16:25:20 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near the great tree

He looked up at the canopy.

The tree's branches spread wider than any cedar should manage, creating a secondary canopy above the surrounding forest. The leaves—if they were leaves—caught the sunset light in ways that didn't quite match the physics he expected.

Something about this tree was wrong. Or perhaps wrongness wasn't the right concept.

---

## SCENE 225
**Time:** 16:25:37 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, near the great tree

"It watches," Tenchi added quietly.

The statement carried no fear. A simple observation, offered with the matter-of-factness of someone describing the weather.

The tree watches.

He filed the information away, adding it to the growing collection of things about this place that defied easy explanation.

---

## SCENE 226
**Time:** 16:25:54 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, moving on from tree

Katsuhito appeared beside them, his arrival soundless.

"The tree is very old," the old man said, his voice carrying the same measured quality it had held all afternoon. "It remembers things the rest of us have forgotten."

Another statement that should have sounded like superstition and didn't.

---

## SCENE 227
**Time:** 16:26:11 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, viewpoint

Tenchi tugged his sleeve. "This way. You can see the lake."

He allowed himself to be led to a gap in the trees—a natural viewpoint, perhaps deliberately maintained. Below and to the south, the lake he'd glimpsed from the bus spread across the valley floor.

---

## SCENE 228
**Time:** 16:26:28 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, viewpoint

The view was startling in its beauty.

The lake reflected the sunset sky—oranges and pinks and the deep blue of approaching evening. The water was still, mirror-perfect, capturing an inverted world in its surface.

"Masaki Lake," Katsuhito said from behind him. "It's been here as long as the mountain."

---

## SCENE 229
**Time:** 16:26:45 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, viewpoint

"Is it deep?"

"In places." Katsuhito moved to stand beside him. "The mountain people tell stories about what lives in the depths. Most are probably exaggerations."

Probably. Not definitely. The qualifier hung in the air.

---

## SCENE 230
**Time:** 16:27:02 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, viewpoint

Tenchi pressed against the viewpoint's edge, familiar enough with the spot to know exactly how far he could lean.

"There are fish," he reported. "Ojii-chan catches them sometimes. But not the big ones. The big ones stay deep."

"How big are the big ones?"

"Big." The word encompassed everything Tenchi couldn't measure.

---

## SCENE 231
**Time:** 16:27:19 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, continuing tour

They circled back toward the shrine buildings.

The tour had been brief but informative—main hall, residence, the great tree, the lake view. The shrine's world in miniature. His world now, presumably.

The path led past another building he hadn't noticed before.

---

## SCENE 232
**Time:** 16:27:36 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, passing storage building

"Storage," Katsuhito supplied before he could ask. "Old records. Ceremonial items not in use. The accumulated belongings of seven centuries."

Seven centuries of history, housed in a building smaller than his graduate school apartment.

---

## SCENE 233
**Time:** 16:27:53 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, approaching path to Tsukino house

A stone path departed the shrine grounds to the north.

The path was narrower than the main approach, less formal, leading into the forest with the casual certainty of routes walked daily for generations.

"Your house is this way," Katsuhito said. "Fifteen minutes on foot. Perhaps ten for someone young."

---

## SCENE 234
**Time:** 16:28:10 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, regarding path

He looked down the path into the trees.

Somewhere along that route, a house waited. His house, according to documents that claimed him as someone he didn't remember being.

"Will you come?" he asked.

---

## SCENE 235
**Time:** 16:28:27 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, regarding path

Katsuhito shook his head.

"Tenchi and I will prepare dinner. You'll want time alone in the house first. Time to... settle in."

The pause before "settle in" carried weight. Katsuhito understood something about new arrivals, about the need for solitude when confronting strange inheritances.

---

## SCENE 236
**Time:** 16:28:44 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, discussing plans

"Come back in an hour," Katsuhito continued. "We'll eat together. If you're comfortable with that."

An invitation. A choice offered rather than demanded.

"I'd like that. Thank you."

---

## SCENE 237
**Time:** 16:29:01 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, departure imminent

Tenchi appeared at his elbow.

"Can I come with you? To see the house?"

The request was directed at Sheldon, but the boy's eyes flicked to his grandfather for permission. Still learning which authorities governed which domains.

---

## SCENE 238
**Time:** 16:29:18 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, addressing Tenchi's request

"Another time," Katsuhito said gently. "Let Tsukino-san have this evening alone."

Disappointment flickered across Tenchi's face—there and gone, managed with a maturity beyond his years.

"Okay." He looked up at Sheldon. "But tomorrow you'll show me?"

---

## SCENE 239
**Time:** 16:29:35 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, promising tomorrow

"Tomorrow," he agreed.

The promise cost nothing and gained something—a thread of connection, a reason for the child to look forward to his continued presence. Small stakes, but real.

---

## SCENE 240
**Time:** 16:29:52 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds, beginning walk to house

He stepped onto the northward path.

The stone gave way to packed earth after a few meters, the formal shrine grounds transitioning to the forest trail. Cedar branches arched overhead, filtering the last direct sunlight into scattered gold.

Behind him, Tenchi called: "Remember—one hour!"

---

## SCENE 241
**Time:** 16:30:09 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

The path wound through the forest without apparent plan.

Not a straight line but a gentle meandering, following the contours of the land. Generations of feet had established this route, had worn it into the earth through accumulated passage.

He walked in their footsteps now.

---

## SCENE 242
**Time:** 16:32:26 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

The forest sounds enclosed him.

Bird calls—different from the uguisu of the lower field, variations he couldn't name. Wind in the branches, the soft creak of wood moving. His own footsteps, muffled by the earth underfoot.

No human sounds except his breathing.

---

## SCENE 243
**Time:** 16:34:43 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

A stream crossed the path.

Small, barely a meter wide, bridged by flat stones placed deliberately. He crossed without breaking stride, the stones solid beneath his shoes.

The stream continued down the slope, presumably joining other waters on its way to the lake below.

---

## SCENE 244
**Time:** 16:37:00 JST  
**Location:** Path to Tsukino house

The forest thinned ahead.

Through the gaps in the trees, he could see open sky, the beginning of a clearing. Something built—a roofline visible, the particular geometry of human construction.

The house. His house.

---

## SCENE 245
**Time:** 16:39:17 JST  
**Location:** Approaching Tsukino house

He emerged from the forest into a small clearing.

The house stood at its center—traditional construction, single story with an elevated foundation, the roof tiles showing the gray patina of age. A garden surrounded it, overgrown but not abandoned. Someone had cut back the worst of the vegetation recently.

---

## SCENE 246
**Time:** 16:39:34 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house exterior

The house was modest in size.

Not large by any standard—perhaps four rooms, maybe five. A well stood to one side, covered with a wooden cap. A stone path led from the forest trail to the genkan entrance.

This was what his mother—the mother he'd been given—had left him.

---

## SCENE 247
**Time:** 16:39:51 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house exterior

He approached slowly.

Not caution exactly—nothing about the house suggested danger. More a sense of occasion. Of approaching something that would matter. Whatever happened next would shape his understanding of this new existence.

---

## SCENE 248
**Time:** 16:40:08 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, genkan

The entrance was unlocked.

The sliding door moved easily on its track, well-maintained despite the house's vacancy. Beyond it, the genkan waited—stone step, wooden floor, the traditional boundary between outside and in.

He stepped out of his shoes and placed them pointing outward.

---

## SCENE 249
**Time:** 16:40:25 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, entering main room

The interior smelled of tatami and absence.

Old straw matting, aired recently but carrying years of compressed time. Dust motes drifted in the late light from the windows. The air was still, undisturbed by habitation.

A house waiting, as Katsuhito had said.

---

## SCENE 250
**Time:** 16:40:42 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino house, main room

He stood in the center of the room and let the house settle around him.

Low table, cushions stacked in one corner, tokonoma alcove empty of decoration. The simplicity of a space prepared for living but not yet lived in. A canvas waiting for paint.

He was home.

The word arrived without permission, claiming him as he claimed the space.

Home.
