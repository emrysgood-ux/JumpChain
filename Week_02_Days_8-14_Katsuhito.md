### Notable Scenes

## SCENE 289 | 21:38 | Shrine Grounds - Engawa

Two weeks. Fourteen days of observation had produced conclusions that, two weeks ago, would have seemed premature.

The stranger belonged here now. Not by right of history or blood, but by demonstrated commitment and contribution.

The stranger's nature remained unknown. The origins remained opaque.

But the what had become clear: a helper, a contributor, a presence that strengthened rather than threatened.

The watching would continue. But the intensity could moderate.

Who was this man? What purpose had brought him here?

The questions remained. The danger had passed.
