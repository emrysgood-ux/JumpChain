## PART II: INTENT DOCUMENTATION LEVELS

### 2.1 Story-Level Intent

```markdown
## SON OF COSMOS — CORE INTENT

**One-Sentence Summary:**
A found family story where a reincarnated man learns to live again through cooking, caring, and cosmic connection.

**Why This Story:**
- To explore healing through chosen family rather than romantic relationship
- To portray nurturing masculinity as strength
- To tell a slow-burn slice-of-life in a universe usually focused on action
- To give Tenchi Muyo characters the domestic depth they deserve

**Core Emotional Promise:**
The reader should feel *warm* — like coming home to a place that accepts them.

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Readers cry from joy, not just sadness
- Slice-of-life moments feel meaningful, not filler
- Canon events feel earned after 13 years of buildup
- Sheldon feels like a real person, not a wish-fulfillment insert
```

## PART III: CURRENT INTENT REGISTRY

### 3.1 Son of Cosmos — Story Intent

**Why I'm Writing This:**
- The Tenchi Muyo universe has emotional depth that fanfiction often ignores
- Found family stories resonate deeply with me
- I want to explore what "hero" means in domestic contexts
- The 1000-year timeline allows exploration of change and permanence

**Core Commitments:**
1. Sheldon is not a power fantasy — he's a healing fantasy
2. The domestic life IS the story, not interruption from "real" plot
3. Canon characters are enhanced, not replaced
4. Every scene earns its length

**What I Will Not Compromise:**
- Sheldon's gay identity (acknowledged, not eroticized)
- The mother-son bond with Cosmos (strange but genuine)
- The found family structure (romantic subplots are minimal)
- The slow pace (12 years before canon events)

### 3.2 Phase I Intent (Years 1-3)

**Arc Purpose:** Establish Sheldon's healing and integration

**Why 12 Years Before Canon:**
- Gives Sheldon time to become family, not visitor
- Creates emotional stakes when canon disrupts normalcy
- Allows Tenchi to grow up with Sheldon present
- Earns the "found family" designation through time

**Key Emotional Beats to Preserve:**
1. Day 1: Lost → Found trajectory
2. First cooking scene: Love as action established
3. First Cosmos dream: Connection confirmed
4. Year 1 end: Belonging cemented

### 3.3 Chapter 1 Intent (Days 1-28)

**Purpose:** First month as microcosm of first year

**Why Start In Media Res:**
- Avoid origin story drag
- Sheldon's confusion mirrors reader's learning curve
- Mystery of arrival sustains through mundane content

**Must Preserve:**
- Sensory richness of awakening scene
- Warmth in chest as recurring element
- Katsuhito's testing disguised as hospitality
- Tenchi's immediate trust as catalyst

### 4.2 Key Decisions Logged

**DECISION: Sheldon's Sexuality**
- Date: Project inception
- Choice: Gay, closeted in previous life, accepted in new life
- Rationale: Adds depth without becoming focus; explains isolation; avoids harem participation
- Revisit: Never — core identity choice

**DECISION: 12-Year Gap Before Canon**
- Date: Project inception
- Choice: Begin 1989, canon begins 2001
- Rationale: Earning found family through time investment
- Revisit: Never — structural foundation

**DECISION: Lambda Powers Through Cooking**
- Date: Project inception
- Choice: Powers manifest as nurturing enhancement, not combat
- Rationale: Subverts power fantasy; emphasizes care as action
- Revisit: Never — thematic core

**DECISION: Rea Masaki Addition**
- Date: 2026-01-24
- Choice: Add Rea from Geminar as household member
- Rationale: Third caretaker figure; mysterious origins parallel Sheldon; gives Tenchi sibling dynamic
- Revisit: If Geminar crossover becomes problematic
