## ACCESS NOTES

The prose files are too large (~100K words) for the Google Drive API to extract content. To work with Chapter 1 prose:

1. Open the canonical link directly in your browser
2. Download as .docx or .md from Google Docs
3. Use the local copy for editing

The governance, planning, and registry files in this package contain all the structural documentation needed to understand and navigate Chapter 1.
