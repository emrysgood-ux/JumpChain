# Royal Trees of Jurai

## Overview
The Royal Trees are sentient, sapient beings created by the goddess Tsunami. They serve as the foundation of Juraian civilization, providing power, extended lifespans, and starship capabilities to their bonded partners.

## Origin

### Creation by Tsunami
Approximately 150,000 years ago, Tsunami blessed House Masaki with the Royal Trees:
- Created as descendants of her own power
- Meant to protect and empower the Juraian people
- Each tree is an individual being with its own personality

### Tsunami-no-ki (The First Tree)
The original tree from which all Royal Trees descend:
- Located at the heart of the Royal Palace on Jurai
- Direct manifestation of Tsunami's power
- Connected to all other Royal Trees through subspace

---

## Nature of Royal Trees

### Sentience
Royal Trees are fully sapient beings:
- Have their own personalities
- Can communicate with bonded partners
- Make independent decisions
- Experience emotions

### Reluctance to Fight
Despite their immense power:
- Royal Trees fundamentally oppose violence
- Combat causes them emotional distress
- They fight to protect, not to attack
- This can cause psychological feedback to their partners

### The Mikagami Example
When Seto first used the "Triple Z" attack:
- The Mikagami was forced to destroy numerous enemies
- This caused such severe psychological feedback
- Seto fell into a coma for months
- Illustrates the emotional cost of forcing trees into combat

## Bonding

### The Partnership
Royal Trees bond with individuals in a deep, lifelong connection:
- Tree chooses its partner
- Partnership cannot be forced
- Bond transcends simple ownership
- Partners share consciousness to some degree

### Requirements
- Trees select partners based on unknown criteria
- Juraian heritage helps but isn't required (Seto was adopted)
- Character and potential matter
- First-generation tree partnerships are especially rare

### Benefits of Bonding
| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Extended Lifespan | Potentially thousands of years |
| Enhanced Abilities | Superhuman strength, speed, etc. |
| Ship Command | Direct control of tree-ship |
| Political Status | Succession ranking tied to tree generation |
| Light Hawk Wings | Access to ultimate defensive power |

## As Starships

### Ship Configuration
Royal Trees serve as "the central core of Juraian ships, acting as their 'heart' and computer unit":
- The tree IS the ship in a fundamental sense
- Controls all ship functions
- Provides power through subspace connection
- Pilot and tree work as partners

### Capabilities
- Faster-than-light travel
- Light Hawk Wing generation (by generation)
- Self-repair and regeneration
- Long-term sustainability
- Subspace manipulation

### The Subspace Network
All tree-ships draw power "from a subspace network" connected to Tsunami-no-ki:
- This provides their energy
- Allows communication between trees
- Creates hierarchy based on connection strength
- Tsunami can theoretically control all ships

---

## Reproduction

### Seed Production
Royal Trees produce seeds that become new trees:
- First-generation seeds are extremely rare
- Each generation's seeds become more common
- Seeds carry generational status

### Growth
- Seeds can remain dormant for immense periods
- Billion-year-old seeds remain viable (Idol example)
- Growth requires proper conditions
- New trees develop their own personalities
