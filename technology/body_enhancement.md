## Earthling Enhancement

### Standard Procedure
When Earthlings receive enhancement:
- Lifespans extended to approximately 2,000 years
- Physical capabilities improved
- Allows participation in galactic society
- Queen Funaho is the prime example

### Requirements
- Marriage to enhanced individual (political)
- Special circumstances (GP recruitment)
- Juraian heritage (Masaki family exception)
- Research subjects (rare)

### Implications
Earthlings can:
- Join the Galaxy Police
- Participate in Juraian society
- Live thousands of years
- Have enhanced children

---

## Cultural Impact

### Galaxy Police
- Enhancement is standard issue
- Creates uniformly capable force
- Officers expect long careers
- Builds institutional knowledge

### Jurai
- Enhancement maintains noble class
- Long-lived rulers create stability
- Knowledge accumulates over millennia
- Political relationships span centuries

### Personal Relationships
- Partners may have vastly different lifespans
- Enhancement can equalize this
- Long-term bonds become possible
- Family structures span generations

---

## Limitations

### Not Universal
Enhancement is not available to everyone:
- Requires Federation citizenship or GP membership
- "Underdeveloped" planets excluded
- Cost and access limitations
- Political restrictions

### Not Immortality
Even enhanced individuals:
- Can be killed
- May eventually age (at extreme timescales)
- Face psychological challenges of long life
- Are not invulnerable

### Cannot Grant Powers
Enhancement alone cannot:
- Create Light Hawk Wing capability
- Match Royal Tree bonding
- Provide gem-level abilities
- Transcend natural limitations

---

## Story Significance

Body Enhancement represents:
- The technology gap between Earth and the galaxy
- How "ordinary" people can participate in galactic affairs
- The long-term thinking of galactic civilization
- The potential for Earthlings to integrate

---

## For Story Use

### When Characters Receive Enhancement
Consider:
- The adjustment period
- Changed relationship dynamics
- New capabilities and responsibilities
- The psychological impact of extended lifespan

### Power Scale Reference
Enhancement places characters:
- Above normal humans
- Below supernatural beings (Ryoko, Tenchi)
- On par with standard galactic citizens
- Subject to further enhancement via tree bonding
