## Strategic Considerations

### Patent Strategy

#### Japanese vs. US Patents
- **Japan**: Good for electronics, materials
- **US**: Broader protection, larger market
- **PCT**: International protection for key innovations
- **Strategy**: File in Japan first (residency), expand internationally

#### Licensing vs. Manufacturing
- **Licensing**: Less capital, steady income, lower risk
- **Manufacturing**: More control, higher upside, needs partners
- **Hybrid**: License commoditized tech, manufacture breakthrough items

#### Stealth Innovations
Some patents should be filed through shell companies:
- Prevents pattern recognition
- Avoids "where did THIS come from" questions
- Allows multiple "inventors" to share credit

### Business Structures

#### Phase 1: Consulting/Licensing (1989-1995)
- Low profile
- Build capital
- Establish credentials
- Partner with established companies

#### Phase 2: Research Company (1995-2005)
- "Tsukino Labs" or similar
- Legitimate R&D operation
- Employs talented researchers
- Produces innovations "organically"

#### Phase 3: Conglomerate (2005+)
- Multiple subsidiaries
- International operations
- Foundation for charitable giving
- Political/economic influence

## Risks & Mitigation

### Being Too Successful
**Risk**: Pattern recognition—too many breakthroughs from one source
**Mitigation**:
- Spread patents across entities
- Share credit with collaborators
- Let some discoveries "happen naturally"
- Focus on enabling technologies, not end products

### Butterfly Effects
**Risk**: Changes to timeline affect canon events
**Mitigation**:
- Keep major changes after 2003 (OVA 3 events)
- Avoid military applications
- Don't prevent things that need to happen

### Attracting Wrong Attention
**Risk**: Governments, corporations, criminals notice
**Mitigation**:
- Stay in Japan initially (familiar legal system)
- Build legitimate business infrastructure
- Have powerful friends (eventually, literally)
- Avoid weapons-applicable research

### Washu Finding Out
**Risk**: She realizes he's working from future/alien knowledge
**Mitigation**:
- She already knows more than he does
- Be honest if asked directly
- She might find it amusing
- She's more likely to help than hinder

## Notes for Story Use

### Pacing
- Early phases: Subtle, background wealth building
- Middle phases: Some visible success, questions about source
- Later phases: Established enough not to question

### Drama Opportunities
- Patent disputes
- Corporate espionage
- Explaining success to household
- Washu's reaction to his methods
- Moral choices about technology release

### What NOT to Include
- Detailed technical specifications (boring)
- Patent filing procedures (tedious)
- Business meeting scenes (unless character-relevant)
- Success montages (skip to results)

Focus on: Character growth, relationships, moral choices, humor about mundane vs. cosmic contrast
