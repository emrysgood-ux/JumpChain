## **Pre-Dawn - Morning Observation - Initial Assessment**

## SCENE 001 | 04:03 | Main House - Katsuhito's Quarters
**Type:** Main Plot

Seven hundred thirty-two years of watching. Seven hundred thirty-two years of waiting for threats that might never materialize, for the seal to fail, for Jurai to remember this backwater planet existed.

And now a stranger had appeared from nowhere, speaking perfect Japanese, claiming amnesia, radiating something that defied easy categorization.

Katsuhito rose before dawn as he had for centuries. The stranger slept in the guest room—or perhaps didn't sleep at all. The night had been quiet, but quiet meant nothing.

## SCENE 002 | 04:07 | Main House - Katsuhito's Quarters
**Type:** Internal/Reflection

The man called himself Tsukino Sheldon. American given name, Japanese family name, no documentation, no history, no explanation that satisfied even minimal scrutiny.

And yet.

The energy signature was wrong for a threat. Wrong for Jurai, wrong for the Galaxy Police, wrong for anything he'd catalogued in seven centuries of careful observation. The man felt... constructed. Placed. As if reality had made room for him rather than him forcing his way through.

## SCENE 003 | 04:11 | Main House - Hallway
**Type:** Character Development

The hallway held its pre-dawn darkness. Katsuhito moved through it without need for light—the path memorized across decades of identical mornings.

The guest room's door remained closed. The breathing within suggested actual sleep, though that proved nothing. Advanced infiltrators could simulate unconsciousness convincingly.

He was being paranoid. Probably.

Seven hundred years of paranoia had kept him alive. Had kept the seal intact. Had kept Tenchi safe from knowledge that would only burden a child who might never need to carry such weight.

## SCENE 004-025 | Morning Assessment

The morning unfolded through careful observation. The stranger rose early—earlier than expected. The cooking offer remained, and the execution exceeded any reasonable standard for amateur cuisine.

Katsuhito watched, catalogued, assessed. The knife work precise. The technique professional-grade. The results exceptional.

"You cook well for someone who cannot remember where they learned."

"The skills feel natural. The memories don't accompany them."

The response neither confirmed nor denied anything useful.

## SCENE 026-050 | Shrine Tour

The morning continued through shrine orientation. The stranger absorbed information with visible efficiency—questions minimal, understanding apparently immediate.

The cave received no mention. Some secrets remained unshared regardless of temporary housing arrangements.

### BATCH 2-6: Scenes 051-299 (08:00-22:00)

The day proceeded through observation and assessment. Tenchi's attachment grew visibly. The stranger's behavior remained consistent—helpful, competent, appropriate.

The seal checked twice. Intact both times.

Evening brought reflection. The stranger remained an anomaly, but the immediate threat profile had diminished.

Seven hundred thirty-two years had taught patience. The stranger's secrets would reveal themselves.

Until then: hospitality, observation, careful guardianship.
