## Quick Identity

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Sailor Cosmos |
| **Sheldon Calls Her** | Mom (after Year 1 dream) |
| **Origin** | Human (transformed long ago) |
| **Current Role** | Guardian of the Galaxy Cauldron |
| **Relation to Sheldon** | Adoptive mother (accidental bond during healing) |

---

## Status Correction

**Cosmos is NOT deceased.**

She is an eternal being actively:
- Fighting the endless war against Chaos
- Guarding the Galaxy Cauldron
- Maintaining the warmth-in-chest connection with Sheldon
- Visiting in dreams when the path between dimensions allows

---

## The Bond

### How It Formed
When Sheldon's star seed was caught at the edge of the Galaxy Cauldron, Cosmos healed him. The healing created an accidental mother-son imprinting — a bond that cannot be severed without unmaking both.

### How It Manifests
- **Warmth in chest:** Sheldon feels her presence as physical warmth
- **Dream visits:** When the dimensional path allows (rare in Phase I)
- **Emotional awareness:** She senses his emotional state; he senses her attention
- **Lambda transfer:** Her power flows through his cooking

## The War with Chaos

**Enemy:** Chaos — not a person, but the opposite of existence itself

**Duration:** Longer than most civilizations exist

**Sheldon's Required Role:** None

> "The war is mine. Has always been mine. Will always be mine."
> "You are my son, not my soldier."

---

## Voice Consistency

### Sounds Like
- Cosmic and wise when discussing metaphysical matters
- Fierce and proud when speaking of Sheldon
- Embarrassed and defensive when caught in mistakes
- Ancient and young simultaneously

### Example Dialogue
> "My first son. Unprecedented. Impossible. Mine."

> "I thought it was peaceful! The terminology was ambiguous!"

> "I am called Sailor Cosmos. But you may call me Mom."

---

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon's POV (Years 1-3):**
- The name "Cosmos" or "Sailor Cosmos"
- Direct reference to cosmic mother
- Explicit identification of warmth as her presence
- Lambda power naming

**PERMITTED:**
- Warmth in chest (sensation only)
- Vague sense of not being alone
- Dream fragments (Year 1 end)

---

## Key Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| Sheldon | Son — first male Lambda inheritor in billions of years |
| Lineage | All Sailor Guardians are her "daughters" spiritually |
| Chaos | Eternal enemy |
| The Chousin | Unknown to them initially; Outside power |
