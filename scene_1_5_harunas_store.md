## SCENE 1.5: HARUNA'S STORE

**April 3, 1989 — ~17:00 JST**
**Location:** Path to Haruna's store, near Masaki Shrine approach
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The path from the Tsukino house curved back toward the main road, but a smaller trail branched off to the left before reaching it—a packed-earth track that wound through trees toward what looked like a cluster of buildings. Sheldon followed it, trusting Yamamoto's directions. *Near the shrine path*, he'd said. *Run by Haruna-san.*

The trees thinned after a hundred meters, opening onto a small clearing where three buildings sat in comfortable proximity. A house with a vegetable garden. A storage shed with agricultural equipment visible through the open doors. And between them, facing the path with a faded awning and hand-painted signs, a shop.

Not a shop in any urban sense—no glass storefront, no illuminated signage, no carefully arranged displays. This was a converted section of someone's home, the front room opened up and filled with shelves, a sliding door standing open to catch the afternoon breeze. The sign above read 春菜商店—Haruna Shōten—in characters that had been repainted enough times to show their history.

A small bell chimed as Sheldon stepped onto the raised wooden floor of the entrance. The shop smelled of wood and incense and something floral—dried flowers, maybe, or soap. Shelves lined every wall, packed with the kind of inventory that accumulated over decades: canned goods, rice crackers, cleaning supplies, batteries, incense, candles, soap, towels, stationery, and dozens of items he couldn't immediately identify. A glass case near the back held what looked like local confections, and a small refrigerator hummed quietly beside it.

"Irasshaimase!"

The voice came from somewhere behind a curtain at the back, followed by the sound of movement. A moment later, a woman emerged—small, slightly stooped with age, white hair pulled back in a practical bun, wearing a faded blue apron over a simple housedress. Her face was a map of smile lines, the kind that came from decades of genuine warmth rather than polite performance.

She stopped when she saw him.

The pause lasted perhaps two seconds—long enough for her eyes to take in everything, short enough that someone less observant might have missed it entirely. Then the smile returned, wider than before, and she was moving toward the counter with a speed that belied her apparent age.

"Ah! You must be him. Yamamoto's wife called an hour ago—said there was a young man walking up from the paddies, heading toward the Tsukino place. Said you were tall and polite and spoke Japanese like you'd lived here." She reached the counter and rested her hands on it, studying him with frank curiosity. "She didn't mention how handsome you were, but Setsuko always did leave out the interesting details."

Sheldon felt something shift in his assessment of the situation. The village information network, Katsuhito had called it. Faster than any telephone. He was beginning to understand what that meant.

"Yamamoto-san gave me directions," he said. "He mentioned you might be able to help me get started."

"Takeshi-kun? Of course he did. Good boy, that one—well, he's sixty-four now, so perhaps 'boy' isn't quite right anymore, but I've known him since he was stealing persimmons from my trees, so." She waved a hand as if brushing away the decades. "What do you need? And don't say 'everything'—I've heard that before, and it never ends well for anyone's wallet."

---

What Sheldon needed, it turned out, was more than he'd initially calculated but less than he'd feared.

Haruna moved through her shop with the efficiency of someone who knew exactly where everything was and exactly what a person in his situation would require. She asked questions as she gathered items—practical questions, the kind that revealed information while appearing to simply solve problems.

"The house has been empty how long? Four years? Five? The Yamamoto boy checked on it last autumn, said the roof was holding but the garden had gone wild." She pulled candles from a shelf—thick ones, the kind that would burn for hours. "You'll want these. Power might be connected, might not. Takes the electric company a week to send someone out, and that's if they're feeling motivated."

"I have a pump in the kitchen that works," Sheldon offered.

"Ah! Good, good. Michiko-san always said that pump was the best thing about the house. Fed by the stream from the mountain—clean water, cold water, never fails even in summer droughts." She added matches to the growing pile. "You won't need to boil it, but do anyway, at least until you're sure the pipes are clear. Old houses hold surprises."

Rice. Pickled vegetables in glass jars. Dried fish. Instant noodles. Miso paste. A small bag of salt. A larger bag of rice crackers. Soap—hinoki cypress, she decided for him, because it was what her late husband had used and he had never smelled wrong a day in his life. A towel. A washcloth. A small broom and dustpan.

"You'll want futons," she said, pausing to consider. "I don't sell those, but I know who does. Kondo-san in the village has extras—her daughter moved to Osaka last year and left half her things behind. I'll call her tomorrow, have her bring some up."

"There are futons in the house already. In the closet."

"Michiko's futons?" Haruna's eyebrows rose. "They'll need airing. A full day in the sun, at least. You can use them tonight if you're desperate, but don't blame me if you wake up sneezing." She added a small packet of something to the pile. "Dried herbs. Put them between the layers. Helps with the must."

The total came to ¥3,400. More than he'd expected for basics, less than it might have been in a city. Sheldon paid in cash, watching Haruna's quick fingers sort the bills and coins with practiced ease.

"You're Kiyoshi's nephew," she said as she wrapped his purchases in a cloth bag. It wasn't a question. "The one from America. The physicist."

"Word travels fast."

"Word travels at the speed of concern." She handed him the bag, her eyes sharp despite the warmth in her voice. "People have been waiting for someone to come back to that house. Not just waiting—hoping. The Tsukinos were good people. Good neighbors. When Michiko passed and no one came..." She shrugged, a small gesture that carried years of accumulated disappointment. "We thought that was the end of it."

"I'm here now."

"Yes." She studied him for a moment longer, and Sheldon had the distinct impression of being measured against some internal standard. "You are. And you're staying?"

"I'm staying."

Whatever test that represented, he seemed to pass it. Haruna's face softened into something that looked almost like relief.

"Good. That's good." She reached under the counter and produced a small paper package—wrapped sweets, from the look of it. "For tonight. Don't argue, it's a gift. Michiko used to love these, and I still make them the same way her mother taught me."

---

He was almost to the door when Haruna spoke again.

"The shrine."

Sheldon turned. "Ma'am?"

"You'll need somewhere to stay while the house gets sorted. Masaki Shrine is just up the path—three hundred and twenty steps to the top, but the priest's residence is closer, maybe two hundred steps if you take the side path." She gestured vaguely toward the mountain. "Katsuhito-san is a good man. Quiet, but good. He takes in travelers sometimes, when there's need. And there's a child there—Tenchi, his grandson. Four years old, almost five. Lost his mother two years back, poor thing."

Yamamoto had mentioned the same details. The priest who knew his grandmother. The child who'd lost his mother. The shrine that sat above everything, watching over the village like it had for centuries.

"Yamamoto-san said the priest might know something about my family."

"Katsuhito-san knows something about everyone's family. He's been here longer than anyone can remember." She paused, something flickering behind her eyes—not suspicion, exactly, but something adjacent to it. Awareness, maybe. The kind of look that suggested she knew more than she was saying and had decided, for now, to say nothing. "You should go before it gets dark. The steps are tricky in low light, and you look like you've had a long day."

He had. Longer than she could possibly imagine.

"Thank you, Haruna-san. For everything."

"Come back when you need more. I'm here every day except Sundays, and even then I'm usually here anyway because old habits die harder than old women." She smiled, and the years fell away from her face for just a moment. "Welcome home, Tsukino-san. It's about time someone came back."

---

The path toward the shrine branched off the main road just past Haruna's shop, marked by a simple wooden sign and the first of what would apparently be three hundred and twenty stone steps. The light was golden now, the sun hanging low over the western mountains, and Sheldon could feel the weight of the day settling into his bones.

He had supplies. He had directions. He had a house that was technically habitable and a village that seemed cautiously willing to accept him.

What he didn't have was clarity.

The presence that had placed him here—the system, whatever it was—had given him a life. Documents, money, a family history, property. Everything he needed to exist in this time and place as a person with roots and connections and a future. But it hadn't given him instructions. Hadn't explained what he was supposed to do with any of it.

*Live well*, something whispered in his memory. The only guidance he'd received.

The shrine rose above him, invisible beyond the trees but present nonetheless—a weight on the edge of his awareness, like standing near something large in the dark. The priest there might have answers. Or he might just have hospitality and a spare room, which at this point would be almost as valuable.

Sheldon shifted the cloth bag to his other hand and began to climb.
