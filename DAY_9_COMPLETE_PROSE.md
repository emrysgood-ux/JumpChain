# DAY 9 — THE RHYTHM
## April 11, 1989 (Tuesday)
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain — Chapter 1

---

**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Shrine residence → Tsukino House (work site) → Village (errands) → Shrine residence  
**Weather:** Clear, 19°C high, 10°C low, light wind from the west  
**Sunrise:** 5:43 AM | **Sunset:** 6:31 PM

---

## SCENE 1: MORNING ROUTINE
**Time:** 05:25:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

The ninth morning arrived without announcement.

Sheldon woke before the uguisu, as had become habit. His body had synchronized to rhythms this life hadn't taught it—rising with first light, moving through morning routines with the efficiency of long practice. The futon folded away. The work clothes waited on their hook. The day's shape was already visible in his mind: construction site until noon, errands in the village, council preparation in the evening.

Nine days. The number felt significant in ways he couldn't articulate. Long enough for patterns to establish. Short enough that everything still carried the texture of novelty.

He dressed in the dim room, fingers finding the familiar fabric of Nobuyuki's old work clothes without needing light to guide them.

---

## SCENE 2: KITCHEN DUTY
**Time:** 05:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Katsuhito had assigned him breakfast preparation.

Not as guest labor—as household responsibility. The distinction mattered. Guests helped when they could; household members carried assigned duties. His duty was breakfast on Tuesdays and Fridays, freeing Katsuhito for morning prayers at the shrine proper.

Rice went into the cooker with the three-rinse method that had become automatic. Miso soup required dashi from the container in the refrigerator, wakame seaweed, cubed tofu, chopped green onion. The fish—salted salmon today—would grill while rice finished cooking.

His hands moved through the sequence without conscious direction. Each step followed the previous with the logic of practiced repetition. Katsuhito had shown him once, corrected him twice, and then left him to develop competence through execution.

The kitchen smelled of miso and warming rice. Outside, the mountain's birds began their morning negotiations.

---

## SCENE 3: BREAKFAST WITH TENCHI
**Time:** 06:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Tenchi appeared at the table with sleep still visible in his face.

The boy ate breakfast with the focused attention of someone who took food seriously. Rice disappeared in steady spoonfuls. Miso soup was drunk directly from the bowl. The salmon required careful navigation around bones—a skill Tenchi was still mastering, his small fingers working with concentration that Sheldon found unexpectedly touching.

"The rice is good today," Tenchi said.

"Thank you."

"Grandfather's rice is different. Yours is—" The boy searched for words. "—more sticky. In a good way."

Sheldon filed this away. He'd been measuring water by sight, approximating proportions based on the rice's appearance and the pot's capacity. The slight variation in water produced different textures. Tenchi, apparently, noticed.

"I can adjust it if you prefer less sticky."

"No." Tenchi's response was immediate. "I like how you make it."

---

## SCENE 4: WALK TO WORK SITE
**Time:** 07:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Path between shrine and Tsukino House

The cherry trees had finished their transformation.

Green leaves now filled the space where blossoms had been, creating a tunnel of filtered sunlight where pink confetti had fallen a week ago. The seasonal shift felt complete—spring in full residence, summer's approach visible in the warming air and the insects' increasing presence.

Sheldon walked the path he'd walked eight times before, each repetition adding depth to his understanding of its features. The stream crossing where stones required careful placement. The bend where the house first became visible through trees. The section near the property where Yamada had identified drainage issues that would need addressing before autumn rains.

His body knew this walk now. His feet found purchase without conscious attention. The familiarity felt earned rather than given—knowledge built from days of passage rather than implanted by whatever had brought him here.

---

## SCENE 5: WORK SITE ARRIVAL
**Time:** 07:28:17 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, exterior

Yamada and Takeshi had already begun.

The nephew worked on the scaffolding, preparing the next section of roofing boards for removal. Yamada stood below, reviewing his notebook with the attention of someone planning movements in advance. The day's work was already mapped in his mind—Sheldon recognized the look from his own experience in laboratories, the way a prepared researcher approached complex tasks.

"Good morning, Yamada-san. Takeshi-san."

Both acknowledged him with nods. Yamada pointed to the ladder. "Today we expose the ridge beam connection on the east side. We'll know by noon whether it matches the west."

"What do you expect to find?"

"The same damage, or less, or more. Expectations don't change what we find—they only change how we respond to finding it." The carpenter's philosophy emerged in fragments between practical instructions. "Bring the probe kit up when you come."

---

## SCENE 6: SCAFFOLDING WORK
**Time:** 08:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

The tiles came away with familiar resistance.

Sheldon had learned the technique over four days of practice: pry bar angled beneath the tile's edge, steady pressure to break the clay adhesive, controlled lift to prevent cracking. Each tile represented someone's labor—the original craftsmen who'd formed and fired them, the roofers who'd set them in place, the generations who'd walked beneath their protection.

He worked methodically through his assigned section, stacking removed tiles in patterns that would allow efficient reinstallation. Takeshi had taught him the numbering system: chalk marks indicating position, orientation, and sequence. The roof would be rebuilt using the same tiles wherever possible, the original materials preserved rather than replaced.

"Good," Takeshi said, observing his work. "You've stopped being careful."

"I haven't—"

"You've stopped thinking about being careful. You're just careful now. That's different."

---

## SCENE 7: RIDGE BEAM DISCOVERY
**Time:** 10:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof peak

The east side matched the west.

Yamada probed the ridge beam's connection point with his awl, the same careful technique he'd used on the first discovery. The tool sank into softened wood, finding the pocket decay that had weakened the structure's central spine.

"Consistent damage," he said. "The water found the same channels on both sides. The beam will need partial replacement—sections where it rests on the vertical posts."

"Is that better or worse than full replacement?"

"Better for cost. More complex for execution." Yamada withdrew his awl and cleaned it methodically. "We'll cut out the damaged sections and splice in new timber using traditional joinery. The technique is called *okkake daisen tsugi*—you've seen the preparation for the west side. The east follows the same pattern."

Sheldon had documented the joinery preparation in his notebook, sketching the interlocking cuts that allowed new wood to bond with old without metal fasteners. The technique required precision measured in millimeters, tolerances that left no room for approximation.

"How long will the splicing take?"

"Two days per side. The cuts must be perfect, and perfection requires patience."

---

## SCENE 8: LUNCH BREAK
**Time:** 12:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, engawa

The noon siren echoed from the village below.

They ate on the engawa, the repaired section of decking now solid enough to support their weight without complaint. Onigiri that Sheldon had prepared before leaving the shrine. Tea from a thermos Takeshi kept in his work bag. Pickled vegetables from Katsuhito's stores, the last of Etsuko's batch now supplemented with newer preparations.

"Thursday," Yamada said between bites.

"The village council."

"You've prepared?"

"Katsuhito-san has helped me prepare. He says they'll ask about my intentions—whether I plan to stay, what I'll contribute to the village."

Yamada nodded, his expression neutral. "The council assesses character as much as circumstance. They've seen outsiders promise permanence and disappear within a year. They've seen properties bought for investment and left to decay. Your answers matter, but your presence matters more."

"My presence?"

"You're here. You've worked on this house every day since the damage was found. You've eaten with us, sweated with us, learned what we could teach." The carpenter set down his onigiri. "The council will see that. Words confirm what presence has already demonstrated."

---

## SCENE 9: AFTERNOON WORK
**Time:** 13:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Tsukino House, roof

The roofing boards revealed their history in layers.

Each removed board showed growth rings, the tree's seasons recorded in wood grain that Sheldon was learning to read. Takeshi had explained the basics: tight rings indicated slow growth, dense wood suitable for structural use. Wide rings meant rapid growth, softer material better suited for interior applications. The original builders had selected materials with intention, matching wood properties to structural requirements.

"This board came from a tree that grew near water," Takeshi said, pointing to a pattern of alternating densities. "See how the rings vary? Dry years and wet years, recorded in the wood."

"How do you know it was near water?"

"The variation is too regular. Trees in stable environments show consistent growth. Trees near water sources experience more variation—floods, droughts, the river changing course. The wood remembers."

Sheldon added this to his growing understanding. Wood as archive. Trees as historians. Construction as the arrangement of recorded time into functional form.

---

## SCENE 10: VILLAGE ERRANDS
**Time:** 15:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Village center

The hardware store sat between the post office and the agricultural cooperative.

Sheldon had been sent to collect supplies: specific nails for the roofing work, a replacement blade for Takeshi's handsaw, copper wire for securing tiles during the replacement phase. The list existed in Yamada's handwriting, characters Sheldon could read but not have written himself.

The store owner—Tanaka Hiroshi's older brother, whose name Sheldon had learned was Tanaka Kenji—recognized him now. Not with warmth exactly, but with the acknowledgment of someone whose presence had become familiar.

"The carpenter's new assistant," Tanaka Kenji said. The description carried neither approval nor disapproval.

"Tsukino Sheldon. We've met before."

"Three times now. I remember." The store owner retrieved the requested items with the efficiency of long familiarity with his inventory. "The council meeting is Thursday."

"Yes."

"My wife sits on the council. She's curious about you." Tanaka Kenji set the supplies on the counter. "Curious isn't the same as suspicious, but it's closer to suspicious than to acceptance. You should know the difference."

---

## SCENE 11: SHRINE RETURN
**Time:** 17:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine grounds

The evening light caught the torii gate at the angle that made it glow.

Sheldon paused at the shrine's edge, watching the phenomenon he'd observed before—the way late afternoon sun found particular surfaces on the shrine buildings, illuminating them from within rather than without. The Funaho tree's leaves seemed especially responsive, their green deepening to something closer to blue under specific light conditions.

The tree watched him pass, or seemed to. He'd stopped questioning the sensation, accepting it as one of the mountain's peculiarities. Trees had no eyes. Trees didn't watch. But something about this tree's presence felt attentive in ways ordinary trees didn't.

Katsuhito stood on the main hall's steps, completing some evening ritual Sheldon couldn't identify. The priest's movements were precise without being rushed, purposeful without being mechanical. Whatever he was doing, he'd done it thousands of times before.

Sheldon waited until the ritual concluded before approaching.

"The east side matches the west," he reported. "Yamada-san says the splicing will take four days total—two per side."

"Good news, then. Consistent damage means consistent repair."

"That's what Yamada-san said."

"Yamada and I have known each other for fifty years. We often say the same things." Katsuhito descended the steps with the careful grace of someone who knew exactly how his body moved. "How are you feeling about Thursday?"

"Prepared. Nervous. Both."

"Appropriate responses. One without the other would be concerning."

---

## SCENE 12: DINNER PREPARATION
**Time:** 18:00:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

Tonight Katsuhito cooked.

Sheldon assisted where directed, washing vegetables and preparing rice while the priest managed the more complex preparations. The meal would be curry—not traditional Japanese cuisine, but a dish that had become standard in Japanese households since the Meiji era, adapted from British interpretations of Indian food.

"Tenchi requested it," Katsuhito explained. "He's developing strong opinions about food. This week, curry is his preference."

"Is that a problem?"

"Children should have preferences. The problem comes when preferences become demands." The priest began cutting onions with the same precision he brought to ritual movements. "Tenchi makes requests. I evaluate whether granting them serves his development. Usually, curry is acceptable."

The domestic exchange felt ordinary in ways that surprised Sheldon. He was cooking dinner with a Shinto priest, discussing a four-year-old's food preferences, as if this were the life he'd always lived rather than one that had begun nine days ago.

---

## SCENE 13: TENCHI'S EVENING
**Time:** 19:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, main room

The curry had been approved.

Tenchi ate with enthusiasm that approached reverence, his small body hunched over the bowl with focused attention. The rice-to-curry ratio required precise management—too much rice diluted the flavor; too much curry overwhelmed the palate. The boy had developed his own technique for maintaining balance.

"Sheldon-san," Tenchi said between bites, "why is your house broken?"

The question landed with childish directness. Sheldon considered his answer carefully.

"The house is old. Things that are old sometimes need repair."

"Grandfather is old. Does he need repair?"

"People and houses work differently." Sheldon found himself smiling despite the conversation's unexpected direction. "Houses can't heal themselves. People usually can, at least for a while. Your grandfather takes good care of himself, so he doesn't need the same kind of repair that houses do."

Tenchi processed this, his face showing the concentration of a child working through logical implications. "But eventually?"

"Eventually, everyone needs help. That's why we take care of each other."

The answer seemed to satisfy something in Tenchi's thinking. He returned to his curry with renewed focus, the philosophical inquiry concluded for the moment.

---

## SCENE 14: COUNCIL PREPARATION
**Time:** 20:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"Tell me about the council members," Sheldon said.

Evening had brought a chill that made the engawa's cover welcome. Katsuhito sat with tea, his posture relaxed in ways that working hours didn't permit. The stars were beginning to emerge through the darkening sky.

"Five members," the priest began. "Tanaka Kenji's wife, Tanaka Michiko—she represents the merchants and business owners. Yamamoto Goro, the senior farmer—he speaks for the agricultural interests. Kobayashi Hanae, the retired schoolteacher—she advocates for tradition and education. Suzuki Taro, the post office director—he handles administrative matters. And Mori Yoshio, the head of the neighborhood association—he coordinates between families."

"No one from the shrine?"

"The shrine is represented by my presence in the community, not by council membership. Religious institutions maintain separation from civil governance. It's been this way since the Meiji period."

Sheldon filed the names and roles away. "What should I know about each of them?"

Katsuhito considered. "Tanaka Michiko values practicality. She'll want to know if your presence benefits the village economically. Yamamoto Goro respects hard work—he's seen you at the construction site and will have formed opinions already. Kobayashi Hanae cares about continuity and proper behavior—she knew your great-aunt well. Suzuki Taro wants documentation in order, processes followed correctly. Mori Yoshio watches how people treat their neighbors—small courtesies matter to him."

"That's helpful."

"Understanding people is the beginning of relating to them. The council will understand you through your answers, your presence, your demonstrated commitment. Your job is to let them see who you actually are."

## SCENE 15: NIGHT
**Time:** 22:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

Sleep arrived more easily than it had early in his time here.

The futon felt familiar now, its contours matched to his body's preferences. The sounds of the shrine residence—Katsuhito's movements in the next room, the house settling into nighttime rest, the distant calls of nocturnal birds—formed a landscape of sound that no longer required conscious interpretation.

He lay in darkness, reviewing what he'd learned. The council meeting in two days. The construction progressing toward completion. The household rhythms that had absorbed him without his fully noticing the absorption.

Nine days. Longer than any temporary arrangement should feel permanent, and yet permanence had begun to seem possible. Not guaranteed—nothing here was guaranteed—but possible.

The presence he sometimes felt at the edge of sleep didn't manifest tonight. Perhaps it didn't need to. Perhaps the transformation it had begun was continuing without observation, the way trees grew whether watched or not.

He slept without dreams he would remember.
