# OVERVIEW

**Period:** Year 26 (2014) to Year 100 (2089)
**Focus:** 75 years of married life, children, family expansion, Earth's integration
**Gap Status:** Previously EMPTY — no documentation existed

This is the heart of the "Silver Millennium" — the long peaceful stretch where Sheldon and Yosho build their life together, raise children, watch generations grow, and see Earth slowly become part of the galactic community.

# PHASE 1: ESTABLISHMENT (Years 26-35 / 2014-2024)

## Year 25-26: The Wedding Era

### The Proposal (Year 24, Late 2013)

**Setting:** Funaho-no-ki, the First Generation tree ship, evening

**Context:** Yosho has been considering this for years. He's watched Sheldon integrate, grow, become family. After Sheldon's LHW stabilized (Year 24, 4-5 wings), Yosho knows this isn't temporary.

**The Tradition:** Juraian ship-bond proposals. Yosho brings Sheldon to Funaho for the first time. The tree acknowledges Sheldon — not fully (he can't bond with a Royal Tree) but recognizes him as *acceptable*.

**Yosho's Words:**
> "I have lived seven hundred years. I expected to live seven hundred more in solitude, watching over Tenchi until his destiny arrived and departed. I did not expect you."
> 
> "Juraian marriages are not temporary. They are declarations of intent to share a life — however long that life may be. I do not know how long you will live. I do not know what your goddess intends. But I know that I want to spend whatever time we have together."
> 
> "Will you?"

**Sheldon's Response:**
> "I died once. I woke up in a field with nothing. And somehow I ended up here, with you, and a family I didn't earn but can't imagine leaving."
> 
> "Yes."

### The Wedding (Year 25, Spring 2014)

**Two Ceremonies:**

**Ceremony 1: Private Juraian Rite**
- Location: Funaho-no-ki's internal space
- Attendees: Household only (Tenchi, aunts, Nobuyuki)
- Officiant: Ayeka (as Juraian royal, she has the authority)
- Elements: Tree-bond acknowledgment, exchange of energy signatures, formal declaration
- Significance: This is the "real" wedding in cosmic terms

**Ceremony 2: Public Japanese Ceremony**
- Location: Masaki Shrine
- Attendees: Village, extended family (Kiyoshi's family from Osaka)
- Style: Traditional Shinto
- Officiant: Yosho himself (as shrine priest) with Tenchi assisting
- Cover Story: "The American who's been helping at the shrine is marrying into the family"
- Village Response: "Finally! We've been waiting for this for years."

**Notable Moments:**
- Uncle Kiyoshi (age 92) attends. Weeps. Tells Sheldon his mother would be proud.
- Tenchi serves as best man for both ceremonies.
- Washu provides "wedding gift" — lifespan stabilization treatment for Sheldon (though he doesn't need it; Lambda handles that)
- Ryoko gets drunk and tearfully toasts "to weird families"
- Nobuyuki is genuinely happy for his father-in-law for the first time in years

### Post-Wedding Adjustments (Year 25-26)

**Living Arrangements:**
- Sheldon and Yosho share quarters (Yosho's rooms, expanded)
- The household has grown so large that room allocation is complex
- The Tsukino house in the village becomes overflow housing / Sheldon's workshop

**Village Awareness:**
The wedding forces the village to formally acknowledge what they've suspected:
- The American isn't leaving
- He and the old priest are... together
- 1989-2014 = 25 years and Sheldon hasn't aged visibly
- Rural Japan in 2014: More accepting than 1989, but still quiet about it

**The "We Know" Speech (Year 25)**
Village elder addresses Sheldon privately:
> "The American hasn't aged. The shrine protects this village. The priest's family does things we don't understand. We don't need to understand. We just need to know — are you staying?"
> 
> "Yes."
> 
> "Good. That's all we need."

# PHASE 2: CHILDREN (Years 36-50 / 2025-2039)

## The Decision

**Year 35-36:** Sheldon and Yosho discuss children seriously.

**Considerations:**
- Yosho already has descendants (Tenchi)
- Sheldon has never been a parent
- Biology is... complicated (both male)
- Washu offers technological solutions
- The birthing matrix concept emerges

**The Surprise:**
Sheldon builds the birthing matrix himself. Four PhDs. Genius-level intellect enhanced by grants. He studies everything Washu has published about Juraian biology, everything available about genetic recombination, spends two years in quiet development.

Year 38 (2027): Sheldon presents the completed matrix to Yosho as a gift.

Yosho's reaction: Stunned silence. Then tears. Then:
> "You built this... for me?"

## Achika (First Child)

**Born:** Year 39 (2028)
**Named for:** Tenchi's mother, Kiyone Masaki's daughter, who died young
**Genetic Parents:** Sheldon (primary), Yosho (secondary)

**Physical Traits:**
- Dark skin (Sheldon's genetics expressing)
- Yosho's facial structure
- Dark hair with subtle purple undertones
- Sheldon's build (tall, lean)

**Personality (Developing):**
- Curious from birth
- Calm temperament
- Shows early affinity for plants/trees (Juraian inheritance)
- Calls Tenchi "brother" from the moment she can speak

**Household Response:**
- Tenchi: Immediately protective older brother
- Ryoko: Surprisingly gentle; remembers her own creation
- Ayeka: Formal congratulations hiding genuine emotion
- Washu: Fascinated by the genetics; asks to observe (Sheldon: "Observe. Not experiment.")
- Nobuyuki: Cries. Holds the baby. Says nothing. Doesn't need to.

## Mamoru (Second Child)

**Born:** Year 41 (2030)
**Named for:** Protection, guardianship
**Genetic Parents:** Sheldon (primary), Yosho (secondary), with specific expression modifications

**Physical Traits:**
- Lighter skin than Achika
- **Pink hair** (Usagi's genetics expressing through Cosmos's gift)
- Yosho's eyes
- Sheldon's smile

**Personality (Developing):**
- More energetic than Achika
- Social, loves the household chaos
- Shows early interest in mechanical things (Sheldon's influence?)

**The Pink Hair:**
Washu's observation:
> "Interesting. The Lambda signature in Sheldon's genetic material is expressing phenotypically. Pink is... suggestive."

Sheldon knows what it suggests. Doesn't say.

## Additional Children

**Year 44 (2033):** Third child (details TBD — user decision pending)
**Year 47 (2036):** Fourth child possible
**Additional:** Several more confirmed over the decades

**Spacing:** Approximately 3 years between children, allowing each to establish before the next arrives.

## Nobuyuki's Death (Years 51-55 / 2040-2044)

### The Decline

**Year 50 (2039):** Nobuyuki is 74. Still healthy but slowing. Visits the shrine weekly.

**Year 52 (2041):** First serious health scare. Heart. Washu offers intervention; Nobuyuki declines.
> "I've had a good life. My son is happy. My father-in-law found love again. I have grandchildren I never expected. Let me go when it's time."

**Year 54 (2043):** Hospice period. Nobuyuki moves to the shrine full-time. Family gathers.

### The Death (Year 55 / 2044)

**Setting:** Shrine, summer, surrounded by family

**Present:** Yosho, Sheldon, Tenchi, Ryoko, Achika (16), Mamoru (14), other children, the aunts

**His Final Words:**
To Tenchi: "You became everything I hoped for. More."
To Yosho: "Thank you for letting me be part of this family."
To Sheldon: "Take care of them. All of them."

**Funeral:**
- Traditional Buddhist, per Nobuyuki's wishes
- Village attendance massive — he was born here, died here
- Tenchi officiates
- Yosho shows no public grief; private devastation

**Aftermath:**
- Yosho withdraws for several weeks
- Sheldon handles household, children, gives Yosho space
- First major loss since the household formed
- Marks the end of an era — Nobuyuki was their connection to "normal"

- 100 years since he woke up in a field

**Sheldon's Reflection:**
> "I died at thirty-eight. I've been alive again for a hundred years. I've been married for seventy-five of them. I've raised children, watched them grow, held their children."
> 
> "I still don't fully understand why I'm here. But I've stopped needing to."
