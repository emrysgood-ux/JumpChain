# PART 2: OUR VERSION — THE COMPLICATIONS

## 2.1 — What Changes

**Same Elements:**
- Ayeka's arrival sequence
- Space battle and crash
- Discovery of Yosho's survival

**NEW Complication:**
- Yosho is not just alive
- He is PARTNERED with someone
- That someone is Sheldon
- 12 years of established relationship

## 2.2 — The Discovery Sequence

**Step 1:** Crash Landing (Same as Canon)
- Both ships damaged
- Ayeka, Sasami, Azaka, Kamidake stranded
- Near Masaki shrine

**Step 2:** Meeting the Household
- Canon: Meets Tenchi, eventually Katsuhito
- Our Version: Meets Tenchi, Sheldon, THEN Katsuhito

**Step 3:** The First Complication
- Ayeka sees Sheldon
- Notes: Adult male, living at shrine, clearly belongs here
- Questions: Who is this person?

**Step 4:** Meeting "Katsuhito"
- Canon: Ayeka eventually recognizes him as Yosho
- Our Version: Same recognition, BUT...
- She sees how Katsuhito interacts with Sheldon
- Body language, familiarity, intimacy

**Step 5:** The Full Picture Emerges
- Yosho is alive ✓
- Yosho stayed on Earth by choice ✓
- Yosho married an Earth woman (past tense) ✓
- Yosho is NOW partnered with Sheldon ✓ ← NEW

## 2.3 — The Romantic Expectation Collapse

**What Ayeka Expected:**
- Yosho waiting for her (if alive)
- Yosho's love preserved across 700 years
- Reunion → Marriage → Return to Jurai

**What Ayeka Finds:**
- Yosho moved on (centuries ago)
- Yosho had a family (wife, son, grandson)
- Yosho is CURRENTLY in a relationship
- That relationship is with a man
- That man has been there 12 years
- That man is clearly beloved by her brother

**The Layers of Loss:**
1. **Lost the betrothal** — He was supposed to wait
2. **Lost the reunion** — He chose Earth over Jurai
3. **Lost the framework** — He's with someone else
4. **Lost the understanding** — She doesn't even know WHO Sheldon is

---

# PART 3: AYEKA'S EMOTIONAL ARC

## 3.1 — Stage One: Denial

**Initial Reaction:**
- "This cannot be correct"
- "There must be a misunderstanding"
- "Brother Yosho would never..."

**Behaviors:**
- Refuses to acknowledge Sheldon's role
- Treats Sheldon as servant/guest
- Demands private audience with Yosho

## 3.2 — Stage Two: Anger

**Directed At:**
- Yosho (for abandoning her/Jurai)
- Sheldon (for "taking" her betrothed)
- Herself (for waiting 700 years)
- The situation (for being unfair)

**Potential Outbursts:**
- "You let me believe you were DEAD!"
- "700 years I searched, and THIS is what I find?"
- "Who IS this person?!" (pointing at Sheldon)

## 3.3 — Stage Three: Grief

**What She Mourns:**
- The future she imagined
- The brother she remembered
- 700 years of hope
- Her sense of identity (defined by betrothal)

**Behaviors:**
- Withdrawal
- Tears (rare for proud Ayeka)
- Sasami comforting her
- Possibly leaves temporarily (walks, needs space)

## 3.4 — Stage Four: Processing

**Questions She Must Answer:**
- Did Yosho ever love me romantically?
- Was the betrothal only political?
- What do I do now?
- Where do I belong?

**Realizations:**
- She was a child when he left (relatively)
- 700 years have passed
- People change
- He found happiness
- She has to find her own

## 3.5 — Stage Five: Reframing

**Canon Path:** Redirects romantic feelings to Tenchi
**Our Path:** Something different must happen

**The "Aunt" Opportunity:**
- She cannot be Yosho's wife
- She IS still Tenchi's grand-aunt
- She IS still royalty
- She CAN still have purpose
- She CAN still have family

**The Reframe:**
- From: "Yosho's betrothed"
- To: "Tenchi's grand-aunt, princess of Jurai"

# PART 4: KEY SCENES REQUIRED

## 4.1 — The Crash/Arrival

**POV:** Ayeka or Omniscient
**Key Beats:**
- Ships crash near shrine
- Ayeka emerges, damaged dignity
- Sasami worried but curious
- First sight of Masaki property

**What She Sees:**
- Traditional Japanese shrine
- Well-maintained grounds
- Evidence of habitation
- A MAN approaching (Sheldon? Tenchi?)

## 4.2 — First Meeting with Sheldon

**POV:** Ayeka or Sheldon
**Key Beats:**
- Sheldon approaches crash site (concerned)
- Ayeka asserts princess authority
- Sheldon responds with calm helpfulness
- Not intimidated, not subservient, just... helpful

**Ayeka's Confusion:**
- He doesn't react like a servant
- He doesn't react like a noble
- He acts like he BELONGS here
- Who is this person?

**Possible Dialogue:**

> **AYEKA:** "You there! Identify yourself! This is the business of the Juraian Empire!"
> 
> **SHELDON:** "Ma'am, your ship is on fire. Let's handle that first."

## 4.3 — The Yosho Revelation

**POV:** Ayeka (her discovery)
**Key Beats:**
- Ayeka recognizes Katsuhito as Yosho
- The disguise is penetrated
- She calls him by name
- He does not deny it

**The Moment:**

> **AYEKA:** "...Brother?"
> 
> **KATSUHITO:** *[long pause]* "Hello, Ayeka."

**What Follows:**
- 700 years of questions
- Why didn't you come back?
- Why did you let us think you died?
- Why did you STAY?

## 4.4 — The Sheldon Revelation

**POV:** Ayeka
**Setting:** After initial Yosho conversation, perhaps private
**Trigger:** She asks about the household

**The Discovery:**

> **AYEKA:** "And the man? The one who approached us first?"
> 
> **YOSHO:** "Sheldon. He has been with us for twelve years now."
> 
> **AYEKA:** "With you? In what capacity?"
> 
> **YOSHO:** *[direct, not apologetic]* "In every capacity that matters."

**Ayeka's Processing:**
- The words don't immediately compute
- Then they do
- 700 years of waiting
- For THIS

## 4.5 — The Collapse Scene

**POV:** Ayeka (internal), possibly witnessed by Sasami
**Setting:** Private moment after revelation
**Content:** The emotional breakdown

**What This Scene Must Accomplish:**
- Show the depth of her loss
- Preserve her dignity (she's still a princess)
- Allow genuine grief
- NOT make her a villain
- NOT make Yosho a villain
- Show a woman whose entire life plan just evaporated

**Possible Approach:**
- Ayeka retreats to damaged Ryu-Oh
- Sits in captain's chair
- Replays Yosho's last message (700-year-old recording)
- Contrast: Young Yosho promising to return vs. Current reality
- Tears

## 4.6 — Sasami's Role

**Throughout Ayeka's Crisis:**
- Sasami is her anchor
- Little sister who loves her
- Doesn't fully understand but supports
- May bond with Sheldon separately (cooking connection)

**Important:** Sasami accepting Sheldon helps Ayeka process
- "Sister, he's actually quite kind."
- "He made me breakfast."
- "He reminds me of [positive trait]."

## 4.7 — The Reframe Scene

**POV:** Ayeka
**Timing:** Days after revelation
**Setting:** Conversation with someone (Yosho? Sheldon? Tenchi?)
**Purpose:** Find new framework

**Key Realization:**
- She spent 700 years chasing a betrothal
- The betrothal was political, not romantic (from Yosho's side)
- She was in love with an IDEA of Yosho
- The real Yosho is this elderly man who found peace

**The Turn:**
- What does she want NOW?
- Not the betrothal — that's gone
- Family? Purpose? Identity?
- She can have all of those... differently

**Possible Dialogue (with Yosho):**

> **AYEKA:** "Did you ever... love me? As I loved you?"
> 
> **YOSHO:** "I loved you as my sister. I am sorry I could not be what Jurai wanted me to be."
> 
> **AYEKA:** *[absorbing this]* "...Then what am I to you now?"
> 
> **YOSHO:** "Whatever you wish to be. You could be Tenchi's grand-aunt. Sasami's sister. Part of this family. If you choose."

# PART 5: THE "AUNT" ESTABLISHMENT

## 5.1 — Why Canon's Romantic Redirect Doesn't Work Here

**Canon Logic:**
- Ayeka loses Yosho → Ayeka finds Tenchi
- Tenchi is young, kind, Juraian-blooded
- Romantic transfer makes sense

**Our Version's Problem:**
- Tenchi has TWO stable father figures
- Tenchi doesn't need feminine attention for validation
- The household is ALREADY a family
- Romantic competition would feel out of place

## 5.2 — The Alternative Path

**Instead of Romantic Rival, Ayeka Becomes:**
- The "proper" aunt — etiquette, royal protocol, refinement
- Contrast to Ryoko's chaos
- Valued for her knowledge and dignity
- Protective of family honor

**Her Relationship with Tenchi:**
- Grand-aunt, not romantic interest
- Pride in his heritage
- Desire to teach him royal ways
- Eventual acceptance that he's BOTH Juraian and Earth

**Her Relationship with Ryoko:**
- Still rivalry, but different stakes
- Not "who gets Tenchi"
- Instead: "whose influence shapes the household"
- Proper vs. Chaos
- Eventually grudging respect

## 5.3 — Her Relationship with Sheldon

**Initial:** Resentment, confusion, dismissal
**Developing:** Forced proximity → observation → understanding
**Eventually:** Grudging acceptance → genuine family

**The Key Moment:**
Ayeka must see WHY Yosho chose Sheldon. Not just accept it, but UNDERSTAND it.

**What She Might Observe:**
- Sheldon caring for Yosho in small ways
- Sheldon's competence and calm
- How Yosho relaxes around Sheldon
- The genuine partnership between them

**Possible Scene:**
- Ayeka watching from a distance
- Yosho laughing at something Sheldon said
- She hasn't seen him laugh like that in... ever?
- Realization: He's happy. Actually happy.

# OUTSTANDING DECISIONS

## 6.1 — Who Approaches First?

**Options:**

- Tenchi approaches → First contact
- Yosho approaches → Immediate recognition

**RECOMMENDATION:** Sheldon approaches first

- Shows Sheldon's protective nature

## 6.2 — How Direct is Yosho?

**Options:**
- Immediately confirms partnership
- Lets Ayeka figure it out
- Avoids the topic initially

**RECOMMENDATION:** Direct when asked
- Yosho is 700+ years old; he's past evasion

## 6.3 — How Long is Ayeka's Processing?

**Options:**
- Days (quick acceptance)
- Weeks (gradual)
- Months (extended arc)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Weeks
