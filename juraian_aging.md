# JURAIAN AGING & LIFESPAN SYSTEM
## Canon Reference for Son of Cosmos
### Source: Kajishima Masaki (series creator) Q&A, True Tenchi Muyo novels, OVA materials

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Normal Juraians have the same lifespan as humans.**

This is confirmed directly by series creator Masaki Kajishima. Without enhancement or tree bonding, Juraians live ~80-100 years like humans. Extended lifespans come from three sources:

1. **Body Enhancement** (bio-engineering)
2. **Royal Tree Bonding** (symbiotic partnership)
3. **Washu's Technology** (goddess-level science)

---

## BODY ENHANCEMENT

### What It Is
- Nanotech alteration of genetics and physiology
- Available to military, Galaxy Police, Academy students
- Juraian techniques surpass all others in the galaxy

### Lifespan Effects
| Enhancement Level | Lifespan Extension |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Standard Galaxy Federation | ~2,000 years |
| Juraian techniques | Superior (unspecified, but greater) |
| Multiple enhancements | Cumulative effects |

### Who Has It
- Galaxy Police officers (standard issue)
- Military personnel
- Academy graduates
- Wealthy individuals
- NOT typical Earth-born humans

### Notes
- Detectable by advanced medical technology
- Different types: combat, mental acuity, longevity, etc.
- Can be layered for greater effect

## ROYAL TREE BONDING

### The Primary Source of Juraian Longevity

Royal Trees (descended from Tsunami) provide:
- Life extension treatments
- Body strengthening
- Water of Life (rapid healing)
- Backup power in combat

### Bonding Process
- Trees CHOOSE their partners (cannot be forced)
- Typically bonded for life
- Broken only by death or banishment from Jurai
- Selection ceremony in Royal Arboretum

### Tree Generations & Power

| Generation | Rarity | Light Hawk Wings | Examples |
|------------|--------|------------------|----------|
| 0th (Tsunami-no-ki) | Unique | 10 | Tsunami herself |
| 1st | Extremely rare | 3 | Funaho (Yosho), Kirito (Azusa) |
| 2nd | Rare | 3 (with override) | Ryu-Oh (Ayeka) |
| 3rd | Common (military) | 1 (paired) | Fleet ships |
| 4th+ | Abundant | None | Non-sentient, utility |

### Lifespan by Tree Generation

| Partner Type | Expected Lifespan |
|--------------|-------------------|
| No tree | Human normal (~80-100) |
| 3rd gen tree | Centuries |
| 2nd gen tree | Thousands of years |
| 1st gen tree | Thousands to tens of thousands |
| 1st gen + Washu tech | Hundreds of thousands of years |

**Only 5 individuals in Jurai's history have bonded with 1st generation trees** (not counting Seina Yamada's special case)

## SPECIFIC CHARACTER LIFESPANS

### Yosho/Katsuhito
- **Age at story start (1989):** ~1,500 years
  - ~800 years old when he left Jurai
  - ~700 years on Earth by canon (2001)
  - Story starts 12 years before canon
- **Tree:** Funaho (1st generation)
- **Special factors:** 
  - Ryoko's gems power Funaho (embedded in Tenchi-ken)
  - Extensive body enhancement
  - Uses barrier illusion to appear elderly
  - True form: young man with purple hair/eyes
- **Lifespan potential:** Thousands of years minimum
- **Note:** Could extend life to descendants via Funaho but chose not to (Kasumi's wish)

### Ayeka
- **Chronological age:** ~700+ years
- **Physical age:** ~21 (spent centuries in stasis)
- **Tree:** Ryu-Oh (2nd generation)
- **Lifespan potential:** Thousands of years

### Sasami
- **Chronological age:** ~700+ years
- **Physical age:** ~8-10 (spent centuries in stasis)
- **Tree:** Tsunami-no-ki bond (through assimilation)
- **Special factor:** Will eventually merge completely with Tsunami
- **Lifespan potential:** Effectively immortal (goddess merger)

### Tenchi
- **Starting age:** 17 (canon start)
- **Tree:** None initially, later connected to Tsunami
- **Special factors:**
  - Can generate Light Hawk Wings without tree
  - Culmination of Chousin experiment
  - Own powers sustain him
- **Lifespan potential:** "Hundreds of thousands of years" (per Kajishima)

### Misaki (Ayeka's mother)
- **Lifespan:** "Hundreds of thousands of years" with Washu's technology
- **Note:** Novel mentions she eventually goes insane from outliving loved ones

### Nobuyuki
- **Status:** Juraian blood (Yosho's descendant) but NOT tree-bonded
- **Enhancement:** None (Earth-raised, unaware of heritage initially)
- **Lifespan:** "Expanded" beyond normal human due to genetics
- **Estimate:** Possibly 150-300 years? (story inference)
- **Key point:** Will die within normal-ish timeframe

### Seina Yamada (GXP reference)
- **First enhancement:** Extended to 2,000+ years
- **With 1st gen tree seed:** Effectively immortal
- **Note:** Special case due to Tenchi's intervention

## AGING APPEARANCE

### Physical Aging vs. Chronological Age

Juraians with tree bonds and/or enhancement:
- Remain in physical prime for centuries
- Age extremely slowly once mature
- Can use illusions to appear older (like Yosho)

### Yosho's Illusion
- Uses barrier technique to appear as elderly priest
- True form: young man, purple hair and eyes
- Rarely reveals true appearance
- Illusion is convincing but not physical transformation

---

## WATER OF LIFE

### Function
- Produced by Royal Trees
- Rapidly heals bonded partner
- Used when advanced medical tech unavailable
- NOT the source of longevity (common misconception)

### Availability
- Each tree produces for its partner
- Can be stored/transported
- Effectiveness tied to tree-partner bond

---

## IMPLICATIONS FOR STORY

### Yosho's Projected Lifespan
Given his 1st generation tree bond, extensive enhancement, and Ryoko's gems powering Funaho:
- **Conservative estimate:** 2,000-3,000 years
- **Possible maximum:** 5,000+ years
- **Story uses:** ~2,500 years (dies ~Year 1000)

### Why Yosho Dies at ~2,500
Narrative reasons, but canonically supportable:
- Funaho is rooted, cannot fully function as ship
- Ryoko's gems eventually returned to her
- Accumulated spiritual/emotional fatigue
- Chooses natural end after Sheldon's arrival makes life complete
- Extraordinary lifespan even by Juraian standards

### Nobuyuki's Mortality
- Critical plot element: first major death Sheldon experiences
- Estimated death: Year 45-50 (~90 years old)
- Expanded but not dramatically extended lifespan
- Human-like mortality despite Juraian ancestry

### Tenchi's Longevity
- Will outlive everyone except goddesses
- Present for entire 1,000-year story
- Anchor character across millennia
