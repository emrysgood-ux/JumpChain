## RELATIONSHIPS

| Character | Relationship | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Tsukino Yuki | Childhood friend | Knew her before she left for America (~1958) |
| Masaki Katsuhito | Acquaintance | Sends messages through Sheldon; persimmon code |
| Sheldon Tsukino | First village contact | Recognized him as "Yuki's son" by his eyes |

---

## NARRATIVE FUNCTION

### Primary Role
- **Community welcomer**: First village resident to meet Sheldon
- **Memory keeper**: Connects Sheldon to his mother's pre-America life
- **Exposition vehicle**: Establishes that village expected Sheldon's return

### Plot Threads Connected
- `thread_village_integration`: Sheldon's acceptance by local community
- `thread_mother_grief`: Source of Yuki memories Sheldon doesn't have
- `thread_masaki_connection`: Persimmon message establishes pre-existing community network

### Seeds Planted (Day 1)
1. **"You have her eyes"** — Physical resemblance to Yuki confirmed by someone who knew her
2. **"Four years now"** — Village has been waiting; implicit judgment on delay
3. **Persimmon message** — Coded communication suggesting deeper community ties
4. **"The whole village has been expecting you"** — Sheldon's arrival is not private

---

## FUTURE POTENTIAL

### Possible Developments
- Source of childhood Yuki stories (before America)
- Village gossip network node
- Could notice changes in Sheldon over time (appearance, abilities)
- Persimmon harvest scene (autumn 1989)

### Constraints
- Limited mobility (uses walking stick)
- Unlikely to visit shrine frequently
- Role is local color, not plot-critical

---

## SCENE APPEARANCES

| Scene | Location | Function |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 84-89 | Bus stop | Introduction, recognition, exposition |
| 107 | Bus (final stop approach) | Alerts Sheldon to his stop |
| 110 | Bus exit | Persimmon message relay |
| 113 | After bus | Departs without ceremony |

## CANON NOTES
