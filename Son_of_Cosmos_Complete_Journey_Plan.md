### The Moment

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|

| **What went wrong** | Cascade failure / containment breach |

|-------|--------------|
| **Finding** | Cosmos perceives a damaged star seed drifting |

## 1.3 THE PLACEMENT (Creating Sheldon Tsukino)

**The JumpChain Mechanism**

Cosmos uses the JumpChain framework but modifies it:

|-------------------|------------------|
| Jumper chooses perks | Cosmos selects based on his needs |
| 10-year duration | 1,000 years (unlimited) |
| Multiple universes | Single destination (Tenchi) |
| Game interface | NO interface - abilities feel natural |
| Jumper aware of system | Sheldon has NO meta-knowledge |

### The Tsukino Identity

| **Parents** | Created as genuinely real, now deceased |
| **Extended Family** | Aunt who raised him (letter-writer), now deceased |
| **Birth Year** | 1987 (making him ~2 in this timeline's 1989) |
| **Education** | Four PhDs (genuine, not fabricated memories) |
| **Sabbatical Story** | UC Berkeley professor on leave |

### The Aunt's Letter

The letter Sheldon carries is from his aunt (Cosmos-created history):
- She was his last living relative
- She passed away, hence his trip to Japan
- The letter contains family history, property information
- It's his reason for being in Okayama Prefecture

### Questions to Answer

- [ ] What exactly is in the aunt's letter?
