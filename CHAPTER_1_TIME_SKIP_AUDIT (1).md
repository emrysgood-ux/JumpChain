---

### DAYS 3-21 (April 5-23, 1989)

**Format:** Hour-by-hour tracking tables only
**Scene Registries:** NOT PRESENT
**Status:** Requires scene registry creation from existing hour blocks

These days have 60-minute tracking blocks but no scene numbers or scene breakdowns. The hour-by-hour format provides WHERE everyone is, but not:
- POV assignments
- Word targets
- Scene purposes
- Minute-by-minute breakdowns

**Work Required:** Create scene registries for all 19 days

---

### DAY 22 (April 24, 1989 - Tenchi's Birthday)

| Scene | Time Block | Duration | Severity | Scenes Needed |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **22.1** | **05:30-07:30** | **120 min** | **SEVERE** | **3** |
| 22.2 | 07:30-08:30 | 60 min | BORDERLINE | 1-2 |
| **22.3** | **08:30-12:00** | **210 min** | **CRITICAL** | **5** |
| 22.4 | 12:00-13:00 | 60 min | BORDERLINE | 1 |
| **22.5** | **13:00-18:00** | **300 min** | **CRITICAL** | **8** |
| **22.6** | **18:00-20:30** | **150 min** | **SEVERE** | **4** |
| 22.7 | 20:30-21:30 | 60 min | BORDERLINE | 1 |
| 22.8 | 21:30-22:00 | 30 min | ACCEPTABLE | 1 |

**Day 22 Violations:** 2 CRITICAL, 2 SEVERE, 3 BORDERLINE
**Current Scenes:** 8
**Required Scenes:** ~25+

**NOTE:** Day 22 is Tenchi's 5th birthday. This is a MAJOR day that requires extensive coverage.

---

### DAYS 23-29 (April 25 - May 1, 1989)

These days use improved scene format with 60-90 minute blocks.

**Day 23:** 14 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)
**Day 24:** 14 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)
**Day 25:** 13 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)
**Day 26:** 14 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)
**Day 27:** 16 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)
**Day 28:** 14 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)
**Day 29:** 16 scenes, mostly 60-90 min blocks (BORDERLINE acceptable)

**Assessment:** Days 23-29 are structurally superior but still contain compressed blocks. For true "no time skip" compliance, 90-minute scenes should be subdivided.

## REMEDIATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1: CRITICAL Violations (Immediate)
1. Day 1 Scene 1.5 → Expand to 6-8 scenes
2. Day 2 Scene 2.3 → Expand to 4 scenes
3. Day 2 Scene 2.5 → Expand to 6 scenes
4. Day 2 GAPS → Create 5 scenes for unaccounted time
5. Day 22 Scene 22.3 → Expand to 5 scenes
6. Day 22 Scene 22.5 → Expand to 8 scenes

**Phase 1 Output:** ~35-40 new scene definitions

### Phase 2: SEVERE Violations
1. Day 2 Scene 2.1 → Expand to 2 scenes
2. Day 22 Scene 22.1 → Expand to 3 scenes
3. Day 22 Scene 22.6 → Expand to 4 scenes

**Phase 2 Output:** ~9 new scene definitions

### Phase 3: Scene Registry Creation (Days 3-21)
Convert hour-by-hour tracking into proper scene registries for 19 days.
Estimated: 12-16 scenes per day = 228-304 scene definitions

### Phase 4: BORDERLINE Review (Days 23-29)
Review all 90-minute blocks for subdivision opportunities.
Estimated: 20-40 additional scene subdivisions

---

## WORD COUNT IMPACT

### Current State
- 51 scenes across 22 documented days
- ~129,600 words written
- Average: ~2,500 words per scene

### After Full Remediation
- Estimated 350-400 scenes for Days 1-29
- At 2,500 words per scene: 875,000 - 1,000,000 words for Chapter 1
- At current pace (129,600 words / 22 days): Would need 7.5x more content

### Reality Check
If Chapter 1 = 29 days, and full project = 10,950 days:
- At 35,000 words/day: 383,250,000 words (exceeds 300M target)
- At 25,000 words/day: 273,750,000 words (under target)
- At 30,000 words/day: 328,500,000 words (near target)

**Target daily word count for 300M words: ~27,400 words per story day**

## EXECUTION PLAN

### Immediate Action: Day 1 Scene 1.5 Expansion
Apply the remediation document already created (DAY_001_GRANULARITY_REMEDIATION.md).

### Next: Day 2 Full Expansion
Create complete scene registry with:
- All gaps filled
- All compressed scenes expanded
- Proper minute-by-minute tracking for key scenes

### Systematic: Days 3-21 Scene Registry Creation
One day at a time, convert hour-by-hour tracking to scene format.

### Final: Days 22-29 Refinement
Expand remaining compressed blocks, ensure birthday episode (Day 22) receives full coverage.
