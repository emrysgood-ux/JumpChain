# THE CASCADE PRINCIPLE

Every change has consequences. Those consequences have consequences. This document maps the logical flow from our established changes through all canon events.

---

# TIER 1: HARD CHANGES (Source Events)

These are deliberate alterations. Everything else flows from these.

| # | Change | Timing | Direct Result |
|---|--------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Kiyone dies earlier (~1987-88) | Pre-story | Tenchi raised at shrine |
| 2 | Sheldon arrives (April 1989) | Day 1 | New household member |
| 3 | 12 years of changed upbringing | Years 1-12 | Different Tenchi |

---

# TIER 2: FIRST-ORDER CASCADES

These flow directly from Tier 1 changes.

## From Kiyone's Death:

| Cascade | Mechanism | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Tenchi lives at shrine | No mother at home | Daily Katsuhito influence |
| Nobuyuki absent more | Grief, work escape | Father-figure vacuum |
| Household needs help | Single grandfather, child | Integration opportunity |
| Tenchi emotionally vulnerable | Lost mother young | Open to attachment |

## From Sheldon's Arrival:

| Cascade | Mechanism | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Father-figure vacuum filled | Sheldon present | Stable two-parent dynamic |
| Household runs smoothly | Sheldon's skills | Less chaos |
| Yosho has partner | Companionship | Less isolation |
| Tenchi has role model | Daily interaction | Different development |
| Ryoko observes Sheldon | 12-year astral watch | She knows him pre-release |

## From Changed Upbringing:

| Cascade | Mechanism | Result |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Tenchi emotionally regulated | Stable household | Better crisis response |
| Tenchi trained consistently | Yosho + Sheldon | More skilled at 17 |
| Tenchi knows family secrets | Gradual revelation | Less shocked by supernatural |
| Tenchi models healthy relationships | Sheldon-Yosho dynamic | Different romantic framework |

# THE FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHT

**Canon events are PRESERVED. Canon responses are INFLUENCED.**

The Tenchi Muyo plot happens. The same villains attack. The same crises occur. The same cosmic revelations unfold.

What changes:
1. How the household absorbs each event
2. How quickly they integrate new members
3. What romantic dynamics develop
4. What "family" means by the end

What doesn't change:
1. Threat levels
2. Power dynamics
3. Cosmic hierarchy
4. Major plot beats
