**7.4 --- Kiyone Masaki (Deceased --- Tenchi's Mother)**

CANON STATUS: SOFT CANON (OVA) + AU DIVERGENCE (death date \~1986-1987
is ERROR CONSEQUENCE --- permanent, no retcon permitted)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is Kiyone MASAKI (Tenchi's mother), NOT Kiyone
MAKIBI (Galaxy Police officer who does NOT exist in OVA canon).**

**7.4.1 --- Core Identity**

Parents: - Father: Yosho Masaki Jurai / Katsuhito Masaki - Mother: Airi
Magma Masaki (Chairwoman, Galaxy Police Academy)

Siblings: Minaho Masaki (older sister)

Spouse: Nobuyuki Masaki (married \~early 20th century)

Children: - Tennyo Masaki (\~1910) - Tenchi Masaki (April 24, 1984)

Adopted: Rea (from Geminar, found \~1984)

**7.4.2 --- Why She Died Young (By Juraian Standards)**

At 248 years, Kiyone died of natural aging --- exceptionally young for
someone with Juraian heritage. This was deliberate choice:

No body enhancements: Developed aversion after learning of experiments
performed on her sister Minaho by their mother Airi

No Royal Tree: Never bonded with a tree that could extend her lifespan

Yosho's policy: He does not use Funaho-no-ki to extend his descendants'
lives

Precedent: Kasumi (Yosho's first wife) also refused life extension,
dying at 138

"She chose mortality. She made peace with it. She did not tell Nobuyuki
how little time she had left."

**7.4.3 --- Physical Description (From Photos & Memories)**

**7.4.4 --- Personality (CORRECTED --- Canon)**

⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION: Story Bible v9 described her as "patient,
nurturing." This was WRONG.

**Actual Personality (Per OVA/True Tenchi Novels):**

How She Showed Love: - If she was kind to you, she didn't care about
you - If she made your life difficult, you mattered - She tormented
Nobuyuki for decades before marrying him - "Those that only knew her
after her marriage would never guess" --- marriage mellowed her somewhat

What She HATED: - Sentimentality - Long goodbyes - Explaining her jokes

**7.4.5 --- Complete Biography (\~248 Years)**

\~1739: Born to Yosho and Airi (likely off-Earth, at Galaxy Academy or
Airai territory)

Childhood: Raised primarily by older sister Minaho. Inherited
mischievous streak from mother Airi. Developed aversion to
bio-enhancement after learning of experiments on Minaho.

\~1800-1869: Existed between cultures as daughter of exiled Juraian
prince and Airaian official. Visited Earth periodically. Learned shrine
traditions from Yosho. Met young Nobuyuki when he was a child.

\~1880s-1900s (The Courtship): Nobuyuki's parents died when he was a
boy. Kiyone --- already over 140 years old but appearing young ---
tormented him relentlessly for decades. "Villagers seriously questioned
if something was wrong with his head" when he proposed. She said yes.

\~Early 1900s: Married Nobuyuki. Changed hair color to grey.

\~1910: Daughter Tennyo born.

\~1910-1983: Lived at shrine. Tennyo eventually left Earth (unchanging
appearance made staying impossible). Kiyone managed household, helped
Yosho maintain shrine, became known as "Nobu's wife" rather than the
prankster of old. Drew on Seina Yamada's face while he slept (proving
she never fully mellowed).

April 24, 1984: Tenchi Masaki born.

\~1984 (before or after Tenchi): Discovered preteen Rea from Geminar in a
field. The girl was disoriented, with no memory of how she arrived. Kiyone
took her in as an adopted younger sister without revealing her true origins.

\~1985-1986: Raised both Tenchi and Rea. Rea (~11-13) helped care for infant
Tenchi. Kiyone secretly studied Rea's origins but found no answers.

\~1986-1987: Died of natural aging. Tenchi was 2-3 years old.

**7.4.6 --- The Death Script (CANON)**

⚠️ This is canon. Kiyone actually did this.

Kiyone wrote an "extremely morbidly-humorous script" for Yosho and
Nobuyuki to follow when explaining her death to Tenchi. Co-written with
her mother Airi.

The Script Contains: - Several stories where Kiyone gets hurt but
DOESN'T die (due to Juraian heritage) - None of these stories are
related to her actual death (natural old age) - The stories are designed
to make Tenchi laugh through grief - The entire thing is a prank --- her
final one

Why She Did This: - Control: She couldn't control dying; she could
control how it was told - Protection: "Your mother died of old age at
248" reveals family secrets Tenchi isn't ready for - Love: Her love
language was pranks --- this IS how she says "I love you" - Legacy: She
wanted to be remembered as herself, not as a tragedy

Story Implication: In April 1989, if Tenchi mentions how his mother
died, the story will be one of the fake versions. Sheldon will believe
it. Everyone will believe it. The truth comes much later.

**7.4.7 --- The Letter**

⚠️ This is the crown piece. The ONLY time readers hear Kiyone speak
directly in 300 million words.

Because Kiyone dies before the story begins (error consequence), readers
will never see her on-page. A letter exists --- written by Kiyone to
Tenchi, to be delivered when he is old enough to understand.

Letter Location: Stored with Yosho; to be given to Tenchi at specific
age or life event.

Letter Content: Full text documented in
KIYONE_MASAKI_COMPLETE_BIOGRAPHY.docx

Letter Characteristics: - Captures her voice perfectly (prankster,
direct, dark humor) - Contains her love WITHOUT being sentimental -
Acknowledges she's leaving Tenchi too young - Includes references to:
Yosho ("older than he looks"), Nobuyuki ("an idiot, but a good idiot"),
Rea ("a girl who probably helped raise you"), the cave ("don't go in
it"), the 320 shrine steps - Signed: "Your mother, who was probably
smiling when she wrote this (I was)"

**7.4.8 --- Kiyone's Rituals (Now Inherited)**

**7.4.9 --- Her Grave**

Location: Masaki family cemetery, behind shrine

Maintenance: Katsuhito keeps it immaculate

Visits: Nobuyuki visits alone. Tenchi visits with Katsuhito.

**7.4.10 --- Impact Cascade**

On Yosho/Katsuhito: - Has now buried first wife Kasumi (died at 138) AND
daughter Kiyone (died at 248) - His patience is grief made functional -
Guards the death script --- one of her last wishes

On Nobuyuki: - Hides grief behind comedy --- perverted jokes are armor -
Visits shrine more often since her death - Leaves Tenchi with Yosho
because he can't fill her role - Only Yosho sees through his mask

On Tenchi (April 1989, age 4): - Lost mother at age 2-3 --- fragmentary
memories at best - Memories of Kiyone mixed with memories of Rea -
Believes the death script stories are true - "Warm memory" of her
smiling was probably a joke at his expense - Attaches to caring adults
--- seeking what he lost

On The Household: - A house that feels incomplete --- her absence is
present - Rea has taken over cooking (Kiyone taught her) - The front
garden she wanted to restore --- never finished - Photos of her
throughout --- Tennyo's resemblance makes them strange

**7.4.11 --- What Sheldon Can/Cannot Know (Phase I)**

CAN Learn: - Tenchi's mother died - Her name was Kiyone - She was
Katsuhito's daughter - The fake death script stories (which he will
believe) - She was kind/mischievous (general memories from others)

CANNOT Learn (Phase I): - She was 248 years old - She was half-Juraian,
half-Airaian - The death script was fake - The real cause of death
(natural aging by choice) - Her mother was an alien official - Anything
about her connection to galactic politics
