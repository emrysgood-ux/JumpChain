We're going to explain on how to fully form a Digital Pun-Pun. This marvelous computer will be utilized in order to create a machine capable of scanning, analyzing, and turning magic into code in order to fully break into its source code and create/modify spells... maybe in time creating a new form of magic entirely. We're also going to make sure it's capable of bringing a person into cyberspace, and essentially alter their code to be able to make changes as needed... or even make the changes in the physical world.
 
We're going to need to start with the following:
 
-Mother Box (DC)
-Data Storage Chip (Digimon)
-Data Crystal Chip (Halo)
-Datatrax (Transformers)
-Calc. Assisted Choker (Raildex Science)
-Super Computer (Sailor Moon)
-Orgel of Origins (Ar Tonelico)
-Core (Bastion)
-Energy Conservation Policies (Zoids: Legacy)
-Supercomputer (Heist)
-Altar of Spellmaking (The Elder Scrolls)
-Digital Projection Helmet (Sword Art Online)
-NEMO Chair (Saint's Row)
-Alchemy Workshop (Endless Legend)
-Crucible of Eight Trigrams (Journey to the West)
-Quantum Computer Chip (Webmage)
-COMP (Soul Hackers)/(Devil Survivor)
-Sakuradite (Code Geass)
-Slayer Handbook (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)
-Memory Crystal (Five Star Stories)
-Union Core (Arpeggio of Blue Steel)
-Neural Plugs/VR Construct Hub (The Matrix)
-Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (Portal)
-An Arcane Chamber (Sword and Sorcery)
-Grimoire of Grimoires (Vampire Diaries)
-Tower (Dragonlance)
 
The Motherbox is going to be our base, for it is a highly advanced, LOYAL supercomputer that is capable of scanning information from just about everything, along with copying the information. We're going to be attaching it to other equipment as a result, such as the 'Super Computer' from Sailor Moon and Heist to give it some additional information, and the 'Calc. Assisted Choker' from Raildex. This little box may overheat in a half-hour, but we'll naturally work on that to FIX IT. We need the processing power. From there, we attach a 'Quantum Computer Chip' which will double any processing power it possesses... for what we're going to do, we're gonna need this. Especially since we're adding a 'Core' from Bastion along with 'Scanners' from Code Lyoko to likewise include another analysis/storage device. But a bit of additional processing power should help us... which is why the 'Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System' is going to get looked over with the correct code programmed in! And to store the personality, it would be nice to have a 'Union Core' with its delicious Quantum Transceiver in order to ensure it has optimal communication gear.
 
But we have to power this! An 'Orgel of Origins', being a white hole generator, should give us all the power we could ever need on this baby... at least on a normal basis. But just to be safe, we're going to use a stable supply of 'Sakuradite', a high-temperature superconductor that's also a nice power source along with 'Energy Conservation Policies' to further lower energy requirements. You need to be sure to handle its heat and the radioactive properties however, but that should be relatively easy to handle in comparison. Next is as many 'Data Crystal Chips', 'Data Storage Chips', and 'Datatraxes' as possible. We want enough data storage to handle ANYTHING POSSIBLE, and the 'Data Storage Chip' from Digimon will do wonders to actually storing the data of a PERSON and any modifications. Finally, a 'Digital Projection Helmet' and a 'NEMO Chair' mixed in with a 'VR Construct Hub' is capable of transferring someone fully into a cyberspace world. We can probably give someone some 'Neural Plugs' or some wireless version as well. For that extra touch.
 
But we have to go further. 'Alchemy Workshop' increases the ability the machine would have in studying esoteric items, while a 'Crucible of Eight Trigrams' allows you to place a magic item inside of it, and copy magical traits. This is DEMANDED to study some more esoteric items, and the 'Slayer Handbook' will always have a self-updating compendium to the laws of magic in whatever world we go to. When studying magic we need all the information we can get, and this means even the laws themselves. After all, if we do not know the laws, how can we manipulate them effectively? We'll also be putting in the 'Grimoire of Grimoires' which is pretty awesome in that not only does it self-update on every magic or spell we possess, but it can also be a digital medium! Which means installation!
 
But we have a problem. Where the hell do we PUT it? It can't just be out in the open, you know. That's why we have 'An Arcane Chamber' which is perfectly shaped and aspected towards your own individual essence... which is good because we're studying magic to learn how to use the damn thing. We'll also be transplanting pieces of the 'Tower' with all its laboratories and knowledge to place it in a good location.
 
Of course, we need to make sure all of this is in tip-top condition as a computer. We need some more things:
 
-Certified Tech (Fallout)
-Tech Expert (Starcraft)
-Machinist (Skies of Arcadia)
-Analysis (Red Alert 3)
-Whispered (Full Metal Panic)
-Machines, They Just Speak To Me (Firefly)
-Analysis (Adventure Time)
-Build That Wall (Bastion)
-Engineer/Erudition (Halo)
-Not A Stupid Grunt (Mass Effect)
-Technomage (Strike Witches)
-Ancient Knowledge (Mysterious Cities of Gold)
-Gadgeteering (Blazblue)
-Independent Innovation (Gundam AGE)
-upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!! (Red Faction)
-Hard Science (Raildex Science)
-Xenoarchaeologist (Stargate SG-1)
-Engineering Basics (Dead Space)
-The Divine Machines/Chosen of Death (Lord of Light)
-Skills (Star Trek: TNG)
-Demigod Atelier (Asura's Wrath)
-Grease Monkey (Bubblegum Crisis)
-The Plecian Tome (Light of Terra)
-The Maddest Science Yet! (Tenchi Muyo)
-Inventor (Futurama)
-Reverse Engineering (Sekirei)
-Xenospecialist (Gears of War)
-Valkyrian Science (Valkyria Chronicles)
-I Am Iron Man/Retro-Engineer (MCU)
-Etoria Disciple (Final Fantasy XII)
-Holy Forge (Hellgate London)
-Technician (Alpha Cenaturi)
-Engineering (Teen Titans)
-Orokin Tech (Warframe)
-An Order To Things (Gunnerkrigg Court)
-Arch-Magos (40k Redux)
-Feel It Out (F.E.A.R.)
-Damaged Microchip (Terminator)
-Item Construction A+++ (Fate/Extra)
-What's This Do? (Titanfall)
-Xenotechnology (STALKER)
-Technician/Core Competence (Spiral Knights)
-Fitting into a Mould: Scientist (Gravity Rush)
-Peak ADVENT Technology (XCOM 2)
-Hands of Icarus (Heaven's Lost Property)
 
I'm sure we all know the drill by now. Especially with 'Orokin Tech', 'Asgardian' Tech, and 'Demigod Atelier' to ensure that what we use is incredibly advanced, and incredibly EFFICIENT. We want nothing but the best for our little codebreaker. Throwing in 'Divine Machines/Chosen of Death' as well to further add to the incredible advancements we can make. 'Special Attention', 'Mechanical Master', and 'Maker's Prodigy'/'Maker' will also further improve the parts that we're shoving into this advanced computer in order to give it the best abilities and processing skills we can possibly give it. 'Build That Wall' is just so much more important because of the Core we dropped into this thing.
 
On top of that, in order to understand the magic we may encounter we must also gain a clear understanding of the technology we work with. 'An Order To Things', 'Xenospecialist', 'Certified Tech', 'Independent Innovation', 'upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!!', 'Tech Expert', 'Xenotechnology' and 'Xenoarchaeologist' will let us essentially understand about anything we find with enough time. Which is good, because to make sure this machine is completely up to date we have to upgrade it the second we find any advanced technology that could help us out. I do mean ANY advanced technology.
 
But doing all this is going to make for a lot of space problems very very soon. We need to crunch this thing down if we can help it, otherwise it's going to take everything over. Ergo, we need to be mindful of space and how to make things compact:
 
-Gadget Master (007)
-Tinkerer (RWBY)
-Transformium (Transformers)
-Specialty: Mechanics/Engineering (Transformers)
-Master Builder (Transformers)
-Miniaturization/Efficiency (Worm)
-Nano-technician/Nanoforge (Red Faction)
-Nanite Sciences/Nanite Removal and Control (Generator Rex)
-Sohon (Legacy of the Aldenata)
-Weapons Recombination Template (Final Fantasy XIII-2)
-Hybridization Theory (Zoids: Legacy)
-Nanotech Wizard (Ratchet & Clank)
-Reliable Invention (Kim Possible)
-Robust Engineering (Dune)
-Built to Last (Assassin's Creed)
-Panzerkampf (Sabaton)
-Prototyper (Polity)
-They're Like Legoes, Right?/This Is How I want It (Kerbal Space Program)
 
We also need to make sure it doesn't take up too much space... or that it's inefficient. Using a 'Nanoforge' to ensure a sufficient supply of nanotech will help us out, and 'Transformium' along with the 'Tinkerer' and 'Weapons Recombination Template' boons will allow the machine to rebuild itself as needed! Of course, tossing in 'Nanotech Wizard', 'Nano-technician', 'Nanite Sciences'/'Nanite Removal and Control', and 'Sohon' helps out as well to give us some more skill. But adding in 'Gadget Master' and 'Miniaturization/Efficiency' will ensure that when we work on it, we can make it much, MUCH more effective than a machine of its size would be. But let's help with that. 'Hybridization Theory' lets us COMBINE machines, so long as we can handle the power output. We can also use 'They're Like Legoes, Right?' and 'This Is How I Want It' to design some truly absurd modular technology, which will be in demand if we want to save space on this beast of a machine. We'll also throw in 'Prototyper' to ACTUALLY be able to mix and combine different technologies together, to ensure maximum efficiency.
 
Along with powerful technology and shrinking it down, we also need to make sure this stuff can handle the stress we're putting on it. 'Reliable Invention' and 'Panzerkampf' makes sure our equipment NEVER explodes or malfunctions on us on accident. That kind of reliability, that's golden. 'Robust Engineering' and 'Built To Last' will also ensure our materials LAST... like, 'thousands of years' last. We don't know how long we're going to live, so we need to give this thing the care we would reserve for our own bodies.
 
But now that we know of technology levels and how to shrink them down, why not improve them and make them better?
 
-Craftsman of the Gods (Viking Saga)
-Expert Smithing (Ragnarok Online)
-Daedalus' Student/Titan's Blood (God of War)
-Technical Expertise (Iji)
-Remodelling (Medaka Box)
-Glove of the East (Binbougami ga)
-Soul Smith (Dark Souls)
-Soulcraft/Sage (Demons' Souls)
-Feel It Out/Synchronicity Event (F.E.A.R.)
-Mythical Forge (Jade Empire)
-Architect's Eye (Legend of Spyro)
-Architect (Cortex Command)
-Forging (Bionicle)
-Superscale Skills (Evangelion)
-Master Craftsman (King Arthur)
-Special Attention (Gundam AGE)
-Maker's Prodigy/Maker (Darksiders)
-Mechanical Master (Borderlands)
-Chosen of Death (Lord of Light)
-Minor Blessings/Unnatural Skill/Divine Child (Percy Jackson)
-Deity's Weapon/Weapon Synthesis (Warrior's Orochi)
-Ambrosial Artificer (Macross)
-Fixer Upper (Dark Cloud 2)
-Lathe of Heaven (Chrono Trigger)
 
We won't settle for just ANY computer. 'Craftsman of the Gods', 'Master Craftsman', and the 'Mythical Forge' will guarantee any piece of machinery we upgrade or create will be absolutely MARVELOUS with properties and quality far beyond their original. With 'Expert Smithing' we can use a crap ton of Mana and Spiritual Energy to further 'affix' and boost it like crazy! But there's naturally more to do than merely that, for we will need to ensure it has a lot more energies. 'Soul Smith' and 'Glove of the East' will allow us to use spiritual energy to dump into and improve these machines even more to work with different forms of magic!
 
On top of that, 'Deity's Weapon' and 'Weapon Synthesis' both from Warriors Orochi can ensure that the more we use something or try to draw it out, the better enhanced it will become and the more its inherent properties will be magnified. Which is very very nice considering how much we'll be using it. As a bonus, 'Ambrosial Artificer' and 'Fixer Upper' will ensure we can discard unneeded parts while improving the ones we DO need! Combining those with the 'Lathe of Heaven' ability that lets us maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses... well. Let's just say we're really playing for keeps.
 
We'll also toss in 'Forging' from Bionicle to ensure we can use Protodermis for it. You cannot go wrong with Protodermis, especially when ensuring you have a machine that's built to last and needs to change on a whim. To boot, 'Architect's Eye' from LOSS with 'Architect' from Cortex Command with 'Superscale Skills' from Evangelion will ensure whatever we make will be guaranteed to work for the job... in purpose AND fortifications. We're dealing with fundamental forces, no expense can be spared.
 
By this point we'll have a machine that can do the impossible! But why stop there?
 
-Setup Wizard (Harry Potter)
-Doll Maker of Bucuresti (Touhou)
-Magitech (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Magitech (Thundercats)
-Technosorcery (Gargoyles)
-Moon Tech (Okami)
-Digitized Sorcery (Fate/Extra)
-Device Meister (Lyrical Nanoha)
-The Magic of Science (The Witcher)
-Manadrives/Antimatter Manipulation Principle (Final Fantasy 13)
-Antimatter Temporal Principle (Final Fantasy 13-2)
-Crystal Mechanics (Final Fantasy Type-0)
-Crimson Saint (Maoyuu Hero and Demon King)
-Mechanist/Magitek Mastery (Final Fantasy VI)
-Magitek/The Legionsx5/Garland Ironworks buff (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Ruins of the Last Age/Mythology/Azys Lla data (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Mega Bomb/Guru (Chrono Trigger)
-Tech Wizard (Devil Survivor)
-Technomage (Libriomancer)
-Technomancy (Mage: The Awakening)
 
'Technomage' and 'Magitech' of both kinds, and 'Technosorcery' will guarantee we can convert any technology to work with magic successfully, or at least enough for our purposes. 'Doll Maker of Bucuresti' ensures we can reverse engineer stuff, AND we can adequately create whatever magitech we need. Furthermore, the 'Manadrives' and 'Antimatter Manipulation Principle' from FF13 will allow us to effectively analyze and recreate a form of magitech at any time... maybe throw in 'Antimatter Temporal Principle' for good measure. But why stop there? 'Moon Tech' is yet another example of Magitech to assimilate and ensure we can do things well, and to boot we have the 'Crimson Saint' perk which lets us convert magic into tech... or tech into magic with a bit of help from 'Crystal Mechanics'. Provided we study it and provide the work, which will help us bridge the gap further.
 
To boot, 'Magitek Mastery' allows us to convert any technology we have into a partially magical creation while 'Device Meister' lets us convert any technological device to run on magic, which will help it out. Speaking of, 'Mega Bomb' not only lets us mix magic seamlessly into our technology, but 'Guru' lets us study and delve into magic as though we were an engineer applying science... no points for guessing what we can do there. We can also seamlessly blend magic and technology even further with 'Technomancy' to truly blur the lines into something we need.
 
We can buff it, too. 'Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th' along with 'Magitek', five ranks of 'The Legions', and a bit of help from 'Garland Ironworks' can ensure whatever magitech we make will be so ridiculously buffed up that it is SICK. Like, it's going to be crazy. Then we have 'Ruins of the Last Age', 'Mythology', and the data from 'Azys Lla'. This means we have a good understanding of Allagan technology, which... was more or less Magitech on crack. Since we know a bunch of this stuff, it means we're in ridiculous business.
 
But now that we have the base components, we need the means to actually scan the magic or magitech that we wish to study and break.
 
-Scanner (Iji)
-Variable Weapons System (Megaman X)
-Fractal Code Scanner (Digimon)
-Orb Design Plans (Swat Kats)
-Laboratorium (Light of Terra)
-Get Ability (Megaman Battle Network)
-Jakara-type Spyrer Armor (Light of Terra)
-Weapon Copy System (Megaman Classic)
-Scanner (Code Lyoko)
-Mysterious Code (Totally Spies)
-Card Slash (Digimon)
-Archive Magic (Fairy Tail)
-Sceptrum Virtuale (Negima)
-AGE System (Gundam AGE)
-Retribution (Night Angel)
-Sorcerer Savant (Young Justice)
-Alchemy Machines (SBURB)
 
We want to be able to scan anything that moves. Literally, ANYTHING that moves. 'Scanner' and 'Orb Design Plans' will guarantee that at least on a machine level, we can get the schematics of any magitech we scan, and the 'Variable Weapon System' along with the 'Weapon Copy System' can further boost our understanding of machine schematics. But we can throw in 'Laboratorium' to give us an even better idea of studying anything we find. 'Sceptrum Virtuale' and 'Retribution', with 'Get Ability', 'Mysterious Code', and 'Card Slash' will be expert data readers on whatever we scan and study in regards to actual data, and the 'Fractal Code Scanner' can even steal data from things provided we're okay with destroying the original.
 
'Archive Magic' is meant for straight up magic, but adding that in is absolutely CRUCIAL to our plans. We NEED a straight up magic scanner. Fortunately, 'Retribution' and 'Sorcerer Savant' will make it so we can 'scan' and copy the techniques/spells of other users, which is awfully nice. To further help us we're going to include the properties and technology of the 'Jakara-type Spyrer Armor', which is capable of absorbing different energies. If it can be adjusted enough to absorb different types of magic, it would give us further data than just regular scanning. Finally, the 'AGE System' will help us not only enhance and streamline our data mining as time goes on, but even provide the means to craft magitech and even study the self so it can determine what works for us! We can even feed the data and the various magitech samples into the 'Alchemy Machines' to scan, study, and figure out how to synthesize them together! Isn't that nice?
 
Now we get to the meat of it all... the manipulation of data and magic:
 
-Virus Creator (Megaman Battle Network)
-App Master (Soul Hackers)
-Got the Magic Touch: Data (Asura Cryin')
-Decker/Resonance (Shadowrun)
-Conjoined Conjures (Cardcaptor Sakura)
-Temple of Thought (Binbougami ga)
-Favor of Tashlan (Chronicles of Narnia)
-Super-Class-A (Ghost in the Shell)
-Programming Genius (Super Robot Wars OG)
-Foul Hacker!/Survive the Virus (TOME)
-Knowledge is Numbers/Similar Subsystems/Exploitation Now! (Generic Virtual World)
-Prodigal Composer (Unsounded)
-Spellmaker (The Elder Scrolls)
-Maker (Darksiders)
-Reality Hacker (Web Mage)
-Radical (Cowboy Bebop)
-Reprogram/Quantum Computing (Code Lyoko)
-Administrator Access/Will of the User (Kid Radd)
-Can't Stop the Signal (Firefly)
-Altocrystarium (Final Fantasy Type-0)
-Sufficiently Analyzed Magic (Final Fantasy 8)
-Hardened Cosmosphere (Ar Tonelico)
-Talisman Adept (Inukami)
-Grimnir’s Notes (Magicka)
-Spell Sense (Quest for Glory)
-Science Changes Everything (GATE: Thus the JSDF Fought There)
-Guru (Chrono Trigger)
-Cantrip Master (Young Justice)
-Mobius Double Reacharound (SBURB)
-Dark Wisdom (Overlord: Light Novel)
-Experienced Classes: Hedgemage (Dragonlance)
-Enlightened Casting (Mage: The Awakening)
-Hacking In/Brilliant (Person of Interest)
-Maniacal Magical Mixes (Kingdom Hearts)
 
We need every method possible to create our own magic. Or at least every method we can grab in order to sufficiently give the computer enough variety to craft spells. 'Virus Creator' with 'App Master' means we can make just about any 'virus' in order to edit the coding of a spell or program... or person. Point is, it's there to buff us up. 'Got the Magic Touch: Data' also grants us superb data manipulation, along with 'Radical', 'Mobius Double Reacharound', 'Hacking In'/'Brilliant', and 'Can't Stop the Signal' for expert hacking. 'Decker/Resonance' along with 'Super-Class-A', 'Foul Hacker!' and 'Survive the Virus' only further increases the sheer amount of data manipulation we are capable of, and thanks to 'Knowledge is Numbers/Similar Subsystems/Exploitation Now!', we can have further knowledge in cracking programs, writing/rewriting them, and even finding the flaw in each and every 'program' or spell that will allow us to crack it and understand it. Finally, 'Administrator Access'/'Will of the User' allows us a great deal of code analysis, securities, and the ability to manipulate the data of things. Of course we can do better, with 'Reprogram' mixing in with 'Quantum Computing' to REALLY fuck up whatever we want inside a digital system. After all, the more programming ability we have the more easily we can manipulate the magic once it's turned into code.
 
For the actual magic itself, 'Reality Hacker' steps up to the plate. It's magical spells as programs, and combined with the aforementioned 'App Master' we can essentially create spell programs at will. 'Prodigal Composer', 'Maker', 'Grimnir's Notes', 'Experienced Classes: Hedgemage' and 'Talisman Adept' allows us to create our own magical spells or magical effects, while 'Sufficiently Analyzed Magic' lets us study the magic in question before making our own. Combine this with 'Hardened Cosmosphere', 'Altocrystarium', and 'Cantrip Master' for our basic spells, we have even FURTHER customization on all our spells, magical effects, or even any enchantments we may want. Even better... 'Science Changes Everything' makes it so the more science we know, the more efficient our magic becomes. Combined with 'Guru' letting us approach and manipulate magic as though it were a science with 'Enlightened Casting' enhancing our magics according to the sciences we know... oh this will be a TREAT.
 
But this may not always play nice. After all, different magics have different rules. But that's why we have 'Conjoined Conjures'. It may take time, but it lets us combine the magical system of different worlds. With this, we FORCE magic to play nice. We can also use 'Temple of Thought' and 'Favor of Tashlan' in order to study and look up the more spiritually-inclined things as well, which can probably only help us. We also have 'Spell Sense' which lets us sense what kind of magic something is, along with a potential counterspell... which lets us know more than one might think. We can even use 'Dark Wisdom' to ensure any spell we could cast is studied, analyzed... and then transferred over to another system of our preference, should we so choose. On a more basic level we have 'Maniacal Magical Mixes' which can let us mix together spells and create a whole new spell with different effects, and while it's basic we can use the properties to apply it to other things.
 
With all this data crunching, we're going to need some serious mathematics and typing skills:
 
-Whispered (Full Metal Panic)
-Erudition (Halo)
-Human Calculator (NGNL)
-Polymath (Gundam SEED)
-Savant (Pokemon)
-Digital Work (Starcraft)
-Steady Hands (Generic Medical Drama)
-Steady Hands (Showa Kamen Rider)
-Micromanipulators (Raildex)
-Hyperkinesis (Pokemon Mystery Dungeon)
-Fastest Fingers (Evangelion)
-Hardcore Hacking Mode (Kung Fury)
 
'Whispered' guarantees some pretty crazy mathematical skills, to the point where it's literally able to let people make advanced technology. Adding on 'Erudition', 'Human Calculator', and 'Polymath' at the slightest, and we're looking at more and more of a living computer inside our own skulls. 'Savant' makes this even worse, improving our calculation skills with an eidetic memory to boot.
 
But we can't end it here. No, we need speed. 'Digital Work' allows us to process digital information MUCH faster and type with a great deal of speed, improving what we can do, while 'Hardcore Hacking Mode' lets us belt out a ton of code without even looking at the screen or keyboard, while 'Fastest Fingers' not only increases our typing speed to even more crazy levels, but also ensures we have zero coding errors. Let me repeat, ZERO CODING ERRORS. This alone is worth its weight in gold when a single character out of place could seriously wreck something. ...but just to be safe, we'll take 'Steady Hands' and 'Hyperkinesis' to guarantee our hands are perfectly safe and stable. If you want to double up, 'Micromanipulators' to seal the deal.
 
But we have all this data. All this stuff. We need to make SENSE of it all. To see the connections, the lines:
 
-Connections (Starcraft)
-Arcane (Smite)
-Overcoming Sample Bias (Tenchi Muyo)
-Putting It All Together (Tales of Vesparia)
-Tech Tree/The Enlightenment (Civilization)
-The Stone Remembers (Bastion)
-Missing Link (Jurassic Park)
-Cryptarch's Teaching (Destiny)
-Innovator (Codex Alera)
-Technician (Alpha Centauri)
-An Order To Things (Gunnerkrigg Court)
-Elementary My Dear/The Sherlock Scan/Pieces of a Puzzle (Sherlock Holmes)
-Font of Knowledge (Kamen Rider: Neo-Heisei)
 
'Connections', 'Missing Link', and 'Putting It All Together' allows us to see the varying connections between different items, and glean relevant facts as a result of that. 'Overcoming Sample Bias' not only does this as well, but if we have three pieces of related information we can PIECE TOGETHER THE REST. This is worth its weight in gold, and 'Cryptarch's Teaching' allows us to further glean relevant information on what we're looking up. 'An Order To Things' helps us see how things fit together (or how they would if we altered things), with 'Technician' letting us combine different theories to safely come up with something new... a requirement! And as if we needed to make it worse, 'The Stone Remembers' lets us collect Fragments of things, memories and knowledge of things long past... which gives us information. We'll also be using 'Font of Knowledge' which lets us pick out anything in a written or digital archive, using three 'Keywords' to sort through them and gain the information! Fun times.
 
But it gets worse. 'Innovator' lets us find whole new uses for things... important for data and spells, to see outside the box. Then we have 'Tech Tree/Enlightenment'... we designate a goal, it helps us figure out what to research to GET to that point. On top of this, it also ensures we see every possible variation when in the scientific stage, and our analytical theory goes WAY WAY UP. A great boon. Combined with 'Elementary My Dear' and 'Pieces of a Puzzle' which works with the prior perks of fitting things together, AND 'The Sherlock Scan' which lets us enter a hyper-state to review all the knowledge at once? Fucking GOLDEN. But 'Arcane'... it lets us glean facts we normally should not glean. It lets us know things, terrible things that we can pluck out of air. Combined with the rest, and this marvelous machine we will figure out EVERYTHING THERE IS TO FIGURE OUT ABOUT MAGIC ITSELF.
 
But what about the physical? We can't ignore matter:
 
-Simple/Advanced/Alkahestry/Truth (Full Metal Alchemist)
-Alchemy (Gothic)
-Alchemy/Mixing Mixtures (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Alchemy (Samurai Jack)
-Alchemy (World of Warcraft)
-Alchemy (Castlevania)
-Alchemy (Valkyrie Profile)
-Alchemy (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning)
-Alchemist (Farscape)
-Alchemist (The Mighty Boosh)
-Alchemist (Overlord: Light Novel)
-Alchemy (Masters of Magic)
-Alchemist/Formula Formulator (Secrets of Evermore)
-Alchemy Knowledge (Golden Sun)
-Equivalent Exchange (Minecraft)
-Deranged Alchemist (Van Helsing)
-Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation (Journey to the West)
-Transmutation/Alchemy (Fate/)
-Creation Prodigy (Ar Tonelico)
-Synthesis: Rank 3/Efficiency: Rank 1 (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Alchemization (SBURB)
-Alchemical Expertise (eXceed)
-Master Synthesist (Kingdom Hearts)
 
Hence, we get into ALCHEMY. We have to program/let it witness as much alchemical things as possible... after all, what is alchemy if not the science of magic? EVERYTHING from Full Metal Alchemist goes in, and adding things like 'Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation' and 'Master Synthesist' only further increases what we can turn shit into. 'Alchemy' from so many different places, along with 'Deranged Alchemist' from Van Helsing and 'Alchemy Knowledge' from Golden Sun not only lets us further transmute matter but it also allows us to create potions and methods to reinforce the body! Speaking of reinforcement and enhancement, 'Synthesis' at our rank lets us not only increase the effects of the item but it also adds on a small additional effect to help! Even lets us improve an item quality the more we make it, up to twice the amount! Better yet, 'Efficiency' lets us reduce waste along with increasing effects and quality slightly if we take our time with it. Say, if it can reinforce MAGITECH while being able to synthesize it all together with 'Alchemization' to ensure a smoothness, that would be wonderful. Everything down to the molecular state must be taken into account, which is why we're also adding 'Mixing Mixtures'... which lets us mix our alchemical potions together without any risk of conflicting problems.
 
'Equivalent Exchange' and 'Transmutation/Alchemy' will further increase our knowledge and what we can do, especially if you bought the material from Minecraft to work it to its fullest... and since Fate-style magic is total bullshit, it will only increase what we can do in time. And wouldn't you know it, 'Creation Prodigy' is also a form of transmutation and alchemy! With all this, and adding everything we know of it into the computer... even setting up a nice marked area inside the AGE forge that it can create things, we should be able to essentially create whatever magitech device we see fit... or even transmute properties into other things. In a digital sense, that's pretty awesome. Of course one would ask 'how can this machine do alchemy'? Well if you go into cyberspace and craft the programs to let the machine have it... and with all the energy it has, it should be little trouble. 'Alchemical Expertise' is even more bullshit though... if we find out everything ever about an object, no concerns or questions and able to explain everything... we could start taking traits from it and start imbuing other things with those traits! That is absurdly useful. Very useful.
 
But how to interface with it?
 
-Holotable (Marvel Cinematic Universe)
-Control Cube/Holographic Computer (Tenchi Muyo)
-Nullspace Computer (Megas XLR)
-Pip-Boy 3000 (Fallout)
-Personal Digital Assistant (Gears of War)
-Mysterious Code (Totally Spies)
-Sufficiently Advanced EtherScience (Gunnerkrigg Court)
-Wireless Interface/Arcane Interface (Storm Hawks)
-Uplink (Code Lyoko)
-Unbound (Homeworld)
-Raban (Origin: Spirits of the Past)
 
Relatively easy. A 'Holotable' combined with a 'Control Cube' and 'Holographic Computer' will allow us to create any interface we want along with visualizing what we see, and a 'Raban' could even be used for the sake of ensuring the space taken up is null. 'Nullspace Computer' can be added as well, for the sake of making sure of it all. We're going to need to ensure the interface is to our liking to ensure maximum comfort and efficiency... but for the times we're not at the actual computer, we can take a 'Pip-Boy 3000' and modify it with a 'Personal Digital Assistant' along with all the technology we've seen before, in order to guarantee a stable connection to the computer AND to ensure a sound and stable scanner. If you want to go the nanite route that's fine.
 
But the best part? The holographic parts means we can summon the controls at any time... and wouldn't you know it, 'Sufficiently Advanced EtherScience' guarantees we are able to use a machine from far, far away... and the computer is capable of a great, many things. Adding this with 'Wireless Interface'/'Arcane Interface', and suddenly we can interface and still use things from far away. To make it even worse, 'Uplink' lets us psychically use a computer's processing ability along with our own mind, which works nicely with the 'Mysterious Code' we found and the ability to merge our consciousness to the computer systems thanks to 'Unbound'. Hell to the yes. Suddenly being able to digitize things isn't so out of the blue now, is it?
 
 
With this, we have a machine that allows you to systematically scan, analyze, jailbreak, and create your own magic and magitech. Before creating magitech tools as needed... and in the event you feel gutsy, go into cyberspace to alter your own source code. Though it should be noted that trying to turn on 'invincibility mode' is probably going to be beyond the computer's ability. Maybe. It was mostly a study and variety tool.
 
I named mine 'Rebecca', and she is keen.
