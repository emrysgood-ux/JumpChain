Sometimes you just want a place of your own. The Warehouse does really good for workshops, storage, and makeshift homes... but what about a place that resonates with you? A place that can allow us to truly let ourselves go, to be free and to roam as though it were a realm just for us? We all have our fantasies and places we want to go. This? This is for making quite the magical forest. A forest where marvelous things roam and wander, a place that defies imagination.

In order to create a section to ensure all manners of energies and power, we are going to create a series of waters and trees to fuel our Gardens. Let's start with some basic materials:

-Let's Make It Bigger (Unholy Heights)
-Blessing of Goddess (Harvest Moon)
-Crystal Farmer (Final Fantasy XI)
-Crystal Magic (Avernum)
-Geneforge/Crystal Working (Geneforge)
-Magitek Mastery (Final Fantasy VI)
-Living Technology/Smiling Goddess Leaves (Tenchi Muyo)
-Legacy Lived (Assassin's Creed)
-Nectar Pets/Queen's Chambers (SimAnt)
-Soil Brain (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Keeper of the Garden (Cave Story)
-Eco-Dome (World of Warcraft)
-Conductors (Bastion)
-Aura of Cultivation (Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles)
-Extraction Efficiency/Rapid Growth (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Viera Idol (Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings)
-Egg of White (Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings)
-Feather Dragon DNA (Five Star Stories)
-SCP-107 (SCP Foundation)
-Herb Garden/Fertilized Fields/Gravistone/Overgrow (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Blessing of the Land (Sindain) (Dark Cloud 2)
-Lafreisca Seed/Royal Flower Garden (Dark Cloud 2)
-Teleporters (Dark Cloud 2)
-Net Sphere Reformation Device (Blame!)
-Fruitful Bounty (Actraiser)
-Starro-Tech (Young Justice)
-Gardener (Mad Max)
-Cherry Blossom Grove/Black Rose Garden (Fire Emblem: Fates)
-Apiculture Networking (SBURB)
-Green Thumb/Voice of the Forest/Nature Spirits/Growth Accelerant (Origin: Spirits of the Past)
-Worldsinger (Warhammer 40k: Eldar)
-Chaw (Ga'hoolology)

Unholy Heights has a 'Let's Make It Bigger' perk that lets you expand the space inside a place... we won't use it on the warehouse, no. We'll be using it on a small shack or something we'll make for the sake of it, then spend quite a bit of time practicing to make it bigger on the inside. At minimum expect to spend a few hours every day for a thousand years, JUST to be sure. Dirt you can get from anywhere, so long as you make sure to tend to it.

Harvest Moon's 'Blessing of Goddess' to give you sprites to tend to things will make things much easier, and with imparting upon them FFXI's Crystal Farmer skill (along with Crystal-related manipulation skills from Avernum and Geneforge) they will be able to use the magic of crystals in order to cultivate and harvest the most magical of fruits and crops. But we'll also use the 'Legacy' Precursor Blood perk from Assassin's Creed to teach them the 'Keeper of the Garden' knowledge and 'Soil Brain' to help them out with dirt composition and other care concerns like 'Chaw (Ga'hoolology)' for trees themselves. We can also find a way to give them 'Extraction Efficiency' and 'Rapid Growth' to ensure regardless of how they might harvest the plants, that they will not be damaged as a result. Putting in 'Gardener' and 'Fruitful Bounty' will ensure we get all KINDS of fruits and quantities of them, and 'Green Thumb' will only further improve it while putting in 'Worldsinger' for even greater accuracy and encouragement. We can also do 'Voice of the Forest' to talk things out, and 'Nature Spirits' will let us enhance the intellect of the sentient plants that may exist here, such as the trees we'll be using...

But we can add some additional help, with 'Nectar Pets' and 'Queen's Chambers' providing plenty of beneficial ants in the Garden that can be altered much like the Sprites. We'll also be using methods to grant upon them an 'Aura of Cultivation' to ensure anything they tend to is bountiful. But hey, our ants can get along with others, right? That's why we add the 'Lafreisca Seed'. It's a massive flower that's nice in of itself, but the prime gig is the Rainbow Butterfly it brings... which is an excellent caretaker of plants and accelerator of plant growth. We can also put in 'Apiculture Networking' to have some empowered honey producers with the honeycombs being amazing computational abilities. We will also need a proper guardian... someone who will help tend to everyone, a protective figure. The 'Egg of White' should prove proper, as when it grows into Yiazmat (and spliced with the genes of a Feather Dragon) it will be a mighty being indeed.

When we get to Tenchi Muyo, the 'Living Technology' perk and 'Smiling Goddess Leaves' perk to grant you a 1st Generation Jurai Seed becomes the CORNERSTONE of our plan. The basis which we work with. 'Magitek Mastery' from Final Fantasy VI will also guarantee anything we do here will be made partially magical. Why is this needed? Well with the amount of things here, we want to give it all an edge. Which is why in World of Warcraft we're going to be stealing the technology for an 'Eco-Dome' and modifying it to work within this Garden with its arcane methods to encourage growth, along with dropping some Bastion 'Conductors' and the 'Viera Idol' around for both statues and the encouragement of growth and purification! Buuuut we're also going to throw in 'SCP-107' just to ensure we can make it rain anywhere since... well, awesome waters have their effects amplified when used with this tool.

We're also going to want to use 'Starro-Tech'. Why? Well, it helps with mixing the properties of magic, technology, and biology together to make a safe blend. We're throwing a lot of magic into this, and with all the various plants and the potential technology... we want it to play nice. This will at least go a little ways to ensuring it DOES play nice, or at least they can intermingle with each other without something corrupting the other. If it all works on the same system, then it's easier for everything to get along.

SPEAKING of amplifications. Using 'Herb Garden', we're gonna be throwing in 'Fertilized Fields' to further improve the soil quality, along with 'Gravistones' which will... wait for it, GIVE US ADDITIONAL LEVELS. We just got floating islands in our damn Garden. How fucking cool is that?! Then finally 'Overgrow' can mix with 'Let's Make It Bigger' and the Jurai Tree, further ensuring our little paradise can grow and grow even without us being there to keep track of it, albeit incredibly slowly. We can also use the 'Growth Accelerant' to make sure any plant we put in here will grow quite large for needed purposes. We're playing the long game with this now. Speaking of the Jurai Tree, we're also going to be using 'Blessing of the Land' and try to throw in the 'Royal Flower Garden' to ensure not only will plants grow more vibrantly, but that any sentient plants will likewise grow and rally naturally. Which is good because... well. We don't want this thing to rebel, especially when it's as powerful as Jurai trees.

Funny enough with all the space this thing is likely going to take up in its shed, it's going to become a large pocket realm. 'Teleporters' would be good to install at times, to make sure we can get from place to place without it taking so damn long. We can also start adding additional layers for other forms of interaction through the 'Net Sphere Reformation Device'... just start laying the groundwork for a second layer of a world. But we can make it more peaceful as well! Just throw in 'Cherry Blossom Grove' and 'Black Rose Garden' to have all kinds of fun plants along with helping one with any concerning thoughts they might possess, which is important in a Garden.

A heavily modified Geneforge for accuracy will be crucial in order to modify and clone the seed in question, for we don't want descendents for lower-grade trees. We want a total of four 1st Gen Trees, to be placed in a room. This tree will be modified with the following:

-Eywa Trees (JC Avatar)
-Sapient Pearwood (Discworld)
-Seed of Yggdrasil (FF13-3)
-Branch of a World Tree (Tales of Symphonia)
-Health-increasing fruit (Shadows of the Colossus)
-Traits of the stamina-increasing white lizard tails (Shadows of the Colossus)
-S2 Core (Evangelion)
-Gourmet Cells (Toriko)
-Genesaur Sample (World of Warcraft)
-Yggdrasil (Age of Ice)
-Tree of Plenty Seeds (HunterxHunter)
-MUSHROOM ME (Alice in Wonderland)
-Nursery Blueprints (Captain Harlock)
-Golden Tree/Life Tree/Massive Tree (Endless Legend)
-Kypar Tree (World of Warcraft)
-Elemental Pollution (Wood) (Captain Planet)
-Myrrh Tree Seed (Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles)
-Eye of Nidhogg (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Cache of Galbados, Partial Fragment (Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings)
-SCP-143 Sapling (SCP Foundation)
-Golden Apple Seeds (Xena/Hercules: The Legendary Journeys)
-Time Flow Seed (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Eden Seed (Dark Cloud 2)
-Eye of Set (Sword and Sorcery)
-Tea Tree Bonsai (Kingdom of Loathing)
-Erana's Tree (Quest for Glory)
-MTT-Brand Always-Convenient Human SOUL Substitute (Undertale)
-Complete Net Terminal Genes (Blame!)
-Power Tree's Seed (Gravity Rush)
-Sword of Mana (Legend of Mana)
-Stairway to Heaven/Tools of Daedalus/Incubation Pod (Heaven's Lost Property)
-Tree of Life Sapling (The Foundation)
-Seed of Ga'Hoole (Guardians of Ga'Hoole)

The multiple 'S2 Core' engines will mean that they have a second source of superdimensional energy to work with, while mixing in 'Sapient Pearwood' will make it capable of channeling magic, will produce their own mana, AND can link up with each other in order to share energies and processing power, in order to become one massive supercomputer. By utilizing the 'Living Technology' perk, I can use 'Demigod Atelier' from Asura's Wrath to modify the Jurian functions and add so they will each have their own 'Mantra Reactor' and the ability to channel Mantra as well... and thanks to the 'Yggdrasil' tree from FF13-3 and 'Cache of Galbados' from FFXII:RW, they can feed off of emotions (and by proxy, Mantra) to grow and store that additional energy. Their fruit will also be able to permanently increase the vitality and well-being of any who feeds upon it, as well as ensuring it is at the top nutritional potential or even slowly capable of evolving a person. We can even mix in the 'Power Tree's Seed' to throw in some curious gravity abilities for those who partake of the fruit, and the 'Sword of Mana' once we unleash the tree, can definitely be used for some experiments and tinkering to make magic flourish even more. For the sake of some homes for some caretakers though, we'll be throwing in the 'Seed of Ga'Hoole' so there's plenty of places grown into the tree for that stuff!

We can do more, however. There's Aether, which can be used to quite nicely imbue and enhance a person. So how do we find a safe method of producing it without everything going crazy? Well in Archbishop Thoran VII's Vault in FFXIV, there's an 'Eye of Nidhogg', which is an EXTREMELY potent source of aether. It would be prudent to impart this eye into the end result of our trees, so that it can take the Aether in and make it a part of itself... maybe even produce it over time, at the very least monitor it. But we can add another eye too, the 'Eye of Set'... which is not only a perfect tool for arcane actions, but can magnify power and magic tenfold. Is it not right we use this for the end result as well? But we can do even more, and add the 'MTT-Brand Always-Convenient Human SOUL Substitute' (accounting for various soul anatomy perks so the one we give doesn't dissipate suddenly) so that it stays strong and dedicated!

The 'Tree of Plenty' material will ensure that not only is there an abundance of food every day, but that also the trees can make more of themselves every five years. The 'Golden Tree' and 'Life Tree' will ensure that not only is there much more nutrition in the area along with plenty of Dust, but that this Dust will be easily collected... while using the 'Massive Tree' to ensure it's used to taking on multiple types of bark. We'll likely put in some 'Tea Tree Bonsai' to ensure we have some AMAZING tea leaves as well, and 'Eden Seed' along with fruit from 'Erana's Tree' so there's fruit which have some insane nutrition. We will also put in the 'Golden Apple Seeds' to mix with our trees... normally it would not grow. But Jurai trees are not mortal, and the Garden will not a mortal realm. They shall grow well.

Even better, SCP-143 has wood that is super durable and tough with leaves being made blades! We can engineer a specific strain of the Trees and have it grow in another place, however... we want to ensure food and war are different things. So mix the 'Jurai' trees and the 'Kypar' trees from World of Warcraft in with them which will make its sap turn to metal when exposed to flame, and then keep it separate from the primary Trees for this purpose. But we can have them connected to the primary trees through roots for its own sake. We'll DEFINITELY want to keep the 'Tree of Life Sapling' in its own section though, for sanity's sake.

There will be more, however. The Nursery Blueprints will be used to modify the trees themselves, to allow the Harvest Sprites taking care of the place to become plant-like themselves and more in tune with the Garden akin to dryads, and the Mushrooms from Wonderland will be a good way for others to shrink and grow as needed. The Genesaur Sample will ensure the connection to all plants are further amplified, with their powers improved. But why stop there? The 'Incubation Pod' lets us turn people into Angelroids, while 'Tools of Daedalus' and 'Stairway to Heaven' lets us make modules and adjustments. So why not do our best to mix things up? Let us turn the Nursery into the means to make plant-based bio-mechanical beings, able to gain all the benefits of the Garden... technology or otherwise.

Then we throw in 'Elemental Pollution' in order to ensure the trees GROW. Oh yes, grow they will... even possibly making more trees! While 'Myrrh Tree Seed' can ensure the trees all produce purifying liquid... and fortunately can keep things from wilting and dying, which means the 'Time Flow Seed' making everything grow even faster is going to be a tremendous assistance. We're also going to need to give it a shot of 'Complete Net Terminal Genes' to make sure it can look over the virtual side as well.

But we need an atmosphere. We can't just let this all go without a proper atmosphere!

-Gaia-class samples (Light of Terra)
-Psitanium/Psycho-science (Psychonauts)
-Cheat Mode: Fire Ant (Water) (SimAnt)
-Feel It Out/Synchronicity Event (F.E.A.R.)
-Karmatron Dynamics/Karma Chameleon (GUNNM)
-Lost To The Path: Exodite/Path of the Awakening/Bonesinger (Warhammer 40k: Eldar)
-Well of Eternity Water (World of Warcraft)
-Water of Life (Five Star Stories)
-Glove of the East (Binbougami)
-Sorcery (Viking Saga)
-Monster: Space Monster (Godzilla)
-Environmental Adaptation (DC)
-Basic Bioprocessing/Advanced Bioprocessing/Enhanced Body (Symbiote)
-Mixing Mixtures (Banjo Kazooie)
-Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation/Crucible of Eight Trigrams (Journey to the West)

Remember the samples of the 'Gaia-class Atmosphere' that we took from the Light of Terra jump? Well we're going to be replicating this bad boy by using 'Feel It Out' boosted by 'Synchronicity Event' along with 'Glove of the East' ensuring that the vacuum-sealed chambers we'll be using are properly equipped to handle psionic and spiritual energies. We'll also be using them on the 'Karmatron Dynamics' nanites we'll be making to analyze and propagate the situation we'll be wanting to create. From there, we'll be condensing the atmospheric samples down into 'liquid air' by bringing them down to cryogenic temperatures and compressing them. Part of this will go to the 'Crucible of Eight Trigrams' to break it apart and study this thing.

Another part, we need to drink it. That's right, we are drinking the liquid air. That is because 'Cheat Mode: Fire Ant (Water) lets us mix liquids together in our own body, fusing them together and even producing it! We'll be using 'Mixing Mixtures' and 'Basic Bioprocessing/Advanced Bioprocessing' to mix the liquid atmosphere, 'Water of Life', and 'Well of Eternity' water together into an absurd combination. 'Environmental Adaptation' to handle the pressures, 'Monster: Space Monster' and 'Sorcery' to handle the cold, and 'Karmatron Dynamics'/'Karma Chameleon' nanites enhanced by psionic and spiritual energies to help stabilize it all. This should help us create a powerful mix along with the aforementioned studying to assist in replicating the essence.

From there, we get to the actual work. 'Lost To The Path: Exodite' to assist in the eventual seeding and altercation of the Garden area into a Maiden World-like area, and then we create a few Psionic Wells detailed later in this document. With the energy saturating the air, we can use 'Bonesinger' to bring up a lot of powdered Wraithbone into the air, with traces of 'Psitanium' lacing it while using 'Psycho-Science' to help with the psionic fields and currents to mimic the atmosphere as accurately as possible.

We will not stop there, however.

Octiron from Discworld, Fairy Garden from Changeling: The Lost, and the Tomb of Sucellus from the Age of Ice will ensure there is an abundance of magical radiation, glamour (which further works with emotion and will fuel the trees), and a great deal of Life-based mana. Anything will be able to grow there... anything. The Hanging Gardens from Civilization will only guarantee that this will be the case, while 'Rationing' and 'Real Organic Food' ensures they will ALWAYS be extremely nutritious and suffer no issues from pests. Putting around facets of Psitanium will ensure anyone who walks into the Gardens will eventually develop psionic potential as well. Traces of Nitramene will be present to stabilize the effects of all these energies and provide a safe environment for anyone arrive and develop, thanks to the stabilizing properties of Vita-Radiation. 'Myrrh Condensation' will also ensure every plant can create a purifying liquid to ensure nothing bad happens as well, while '14th Crystal's Lingering Echo' will ensure this world can produce Aether along with the Eye that was utilized beforehand.

The 'Khaydarin crystals' and 'Jorium Crystals' will be planted all around to further increase the psionic potential of others and even synchronize with the 'Wraithbone'/'Psitanium' combination. We'll also throw in 'Luna Shard Growths' in order to make anyone nearby become more intelligent as well, because smarts are fun. As a boost, we'll also throw in 'Crystal Division', which can let us merge the plants with crystals and let them absorb any magic around! This will also make sure anyone who enters this dimension, and especially anything we plant, will be graceful, more healthy, and be made MORE as a result. The fruit will be bountiful, water will be as nectar, and it will be a paradise... especially when we add 'Bulb of Hope' and make things BIGGER and even glow!

In World of Warcraft, there are various forms of elemental energy. But these elemental energies can be used in various forms of crafting and can be seen as manifestations of the elements themselves. Therefore we will be using the 'Universal Adapter' perk from Storm Hawks to ensure these forms of energy will be plentiful, supplied by a power source later on. We'll also be throwing in 'Blue Crystals' and 'Yellow Crystals' in order to gain a supply of EVO energy and data on everything around it.

When Age of Ice rolls around, there will be a fifth tree in the center, in the form of the original Yggdrasil. This tree will be given the same traits and properties as the original four Jurai trees, thus ensuring it has all the channeling and growth properties of the four trees and will be able to connect with them. But it will not have its own personality, merely being made the equivalent of an external hard drive/networking system for the four trees (and the Digital Pun-Pun eventually) to work together, increase processing power, use the mighty energies to study something, and calculate tremendous things.

This continues on, due to trees requiring water to grow and sunlight to flourish.

Unholy Heights gives us a wallpaper to place on the ceiling, to ensure there will always be sun or moon when time passes by. That in of itself is easy enough, but we must ensure there is water. Trenches and pools must be dug. Around the square that is the four trees, there will be a square for four pools within the square the trees make that will never touch each other, but all of the trees will be capable of feeding from. These trenches/pools will be lined in Octiron and magical crystals to ensure they cannot seep into the ground, and the top portions will be laced with Nitramene... there will be three decent sized, perfectly smoothed out orbs of Nitramene around each 'pool' to further stabilize it and prevent contamination, with double checking via copious use of 'Tech Tree' from Civilization and 'Technician' from Alpha Centauri in order to ensure various theories can be mixed and matched.

In the center of each pool there will be a core made of Artificial Blastia from Tales of Vesperia, encased within a container made of high-grade Nitramene (combining the properties of both items safely via copious research with the 'Technician' perk from Alpha Centauri and various Magitech perks) to ensure the Aer produced will not cause the surrounding environment or beings to be affected in a detrimental manner. 

Of course, as the trees grow bigger and the pocket dimension they reside in continues to grow as a result of the trees and their increasing power, we need to add more things. Fortunately, we have many such things. The 'Ruins of Patria', once the pocket world is large enough and moved in, can provide quite an amount of Earth Magic and will draw forth a very large amount of resources. 'Yggdrasil' will provide Nature Mana, the 'Tomb of Sucellus' will provide Life, and with additional 'Mana Nodes' there is going to be an incredible amount of energy for the denizens to take in. With the magic that is within this place, they will be powerful and capable. We'll also throw in 'Arcana: Prime' so eventually we'll make Hallows in this Garden, powerful nexi of mystical energy which we can draw from. We can also put in the various 'Lands' from Innistrad, totaling up to 2 Red, 2 Green, 2 Blue, and 4 White Links we have available. Anyone who spends time in this Garden will be molded into a VERY powerful being.

You want to know the best part, though? 'Territory Creation' allows for the enhancement of magic while reducing costs of the magic, all while other effects are in place due to its insane rank. 'Place of Power' ensures we can cast spells to anywhere in the world, and localized spells don't require maintenance, while planting 'Soul Stones' can also grant us a powerful boon in the form of removing Paradox from any magic we cast while giving our soul a direct line to this place. On top of that, 'Node Mastery' DOUBLES the yield of all our mana nodes and magical sources can produce while eliminating conflict. ...but on top of that, 'Book of the Elements' lets us turn ANY powerful source of great natural power into a Node, 'I Am The Fortress' allows us to retain the benefits of these Nodes anywhere we are, at any time. Which is good, because we have 'Siphoning' which lets us absorb magical energy from 'people or items', which... a lot of things in the Garden count for that. This effectively means we always benefit from the sheer power in this place. How insane is that?

Although, we can go more insane. Or in this case, more magical. The 'Lighthouse' with 'Moon Crystal' ensures that we ALWAYS are bathed in moonlight, along with enhances any magic related to night time or the moon. Imagine that, the benefits of Moonlight at any time! 'Road of Stars' will likewise give our current ants and sprites some help by allowing Star Elementals to appear, along with showing celestial bodies any time during the night... along with empowering stellar magic and once again, ANYTHING RELATED TO THE NIGHT. Which means moon. 'Demons!' and 'Hell, Ward Level 5' also seem to provide a fair amount of monsters in a civilization, and anyone who stays within the Garden will find themselves becoming more demonic. Why demons? Why NOT demons? The Star Elementals will make it fun.

But the 'Ruins of Patria' are quite useful for its ability to ensure a land has bountiful natural resources along with the 'Worker's Break Room' providing vast mining veins for ores. Surely we can take advantage of this? 'Sword Plant' ensures that if we plant something, it will grow. But in order to take full advantage, we will be planting raw ore from other worlds. By ensuring synergy via making sure like goes with like, we could potentially cause the 'Ruins of Patria' to slowly, but surely, grow other ores from other worlds.

What kind of ores?

-Elementium/Thorium (World of Warcraft)
-Eternium/Adamantite (World of Warcraft)
-Titanium (Various worlds)
-Pyrite (World of Warcraft)
-Moonstone/Eridium (Borderlands)
-Black/White Trillium (World of Warcraft)
-True Iron/Blackrock Ore (World of Warcraft)
-Mithril (Various worlds)
-Transformium (Transformers)
-Vibranium (Marvel Cinematic Universe)
-Fold Quartz (Macross)
-Raritanium (Ratchet & Clank)
-Raw Unicornium (Robot Unicorn Attack)
-Various metals (Endless Legend)
-Magnite (Zoids: Legacy)
-Magic Ore (Gothic)
-Aurorium (RWBY)
-Naquadah (Stargate SG-1)
-Starmetal (Order of the Stick)
-Gundanium Alloy (Gundam: After Colony)
-Elementite Cache (Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles)
-Zodium Cache/Alexandrite Cache (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Metrotek Chrome Lode (Five Star Stories)
-Halmolium Vein/Sunlite Vein (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Zelmite Vein (Dark Cloud 2)
-Dreamstone (Chrono Trigger)
-Black Opals (Tortall)

Elementium is a material of great power, and seems to be a result of metal fused with all the elements. Thorium is capable of enhancing arcane properties, but Eternium is also capable of augmenting the best properties of an item while infusing them with Arcane Energy. Very useful. Adamantite is useful for its own sake, and Titanium if alchemized with the proper motes can turn into Titansteel... which is useful in of itself.

Pyrite, if compounded and worked properly can turn into Truegold, which not only 'purifies' any potential corruptive energy (see: The Old Gods), but also carries a sort of transformation property that might be utilized. Mixing Black and White Trillium into Balanced Trillium Bars can help stabilize items or properties, which will be useful in helping the Nitramene. The True Iron Ore and Blackrock Ore will be used to make Truesteel, which is a prime component to summoning a spirit called 'The Soul of the Forge'. 'Starmetal' also drastically improves the effect of steel!

Mithril is a powerful ore for obvious reasons, same as the Vibranium. It would only be natural that we would attempt to plant these in the Garden and let them grow. Raritanium can be used to upgrade various Weapons, and is a very useful tool as a result. Finally, Endless Legend has many ores such as Hyperium, Glassteel, Palladium, Quicksilver, the works. All magical items that will be used. All things that will be eventually forged. Then we can throw in Gothic's 'Magic Ore' for the sake of it. 'Magnite' is capable of restoring Zoids, but it can also be used to 'restore' other machines as well.

Aurorium on the other hand severely helps channel certain powers which is amazing in of itself, but then there's Naquadah which greatly amplifies energy. Oh the Naquadah that can be FORGED. It's gonna be bitchin'. And if we needed even more bullshit things, we've also got 'Transformium' which can give us an ample supply of metal that's very very capable of shapeshifting and going along with Cybertronian sciences. Best item? Best item. But if we want to be fucking fabulous there's always 'Raw Unicornium' for its own sake. 'Elementite Cache' grows when magic is present, and is geared towards the creation of tangible objects... which means amazing buildings!

'Zodium' is pretty sweet in that it can be used as the frame of strong weapons, and is especially useful when paired with 'Alexandrite', a gem capable of interacting with spiritual energy and even transferring experiences of a weapon into another. You have any idea how useful that is? It's GOLD for us. There is absolutely no way we wouldn't use it. Then we've got 'Metrotek Chrome' which is an extremely efficient insulator while containing unstable materials. Good for mixing with other elements.

There's other things to consider as well, such as 'Moonstone' and 'Eridium' from Borderlands. Why these? Well, Moonstone can grant interesting effects to weapons, while Eridium is an amazing material for weapons and power sources. Honestly, why not? Then there's 'Fold Quartz'... that will take some jury-rigging all things considered, but it could essentially allow us to assist in spatial and communication technology. THEN we have 'Halmolium' which is a WONDERFULLY amazing magic conductor, while 'Sunlite' blesses anything made with it with the power of the SUN. That's pretty awesome.

'Zelmite' is also a pretty good energy source for machines. We have to be SERIOUSLY CAREFUL of using this, though. It clouds minds. This thing is likely going to be one of those 'handle with extreme caution' things. We just can't use it willy nilly, it's a special thing. But the Dreamstone? Oooh yes. Described as "a perfect conduit for all forms of energy, able to act as both conductor and battery", we're gonna want to grab this baby and grow it as much as we can. We also want the 'Black Opals', gems which can store and AMPLIFY magical energy. Amplification is always cool.

But should this place really be reserved for only trees and metal? Is there not more we can use? Of course there is, for the more magical we can make this place the better. We can add more:

-Metal Seed (Zoids: Legacy)
-Hydromiel (Endless Legend)
-Bag of Seeds (Winnie the Pooh)
-Seeds Galore (Harvest Moon)
-Seeds (Dorf Fortress)
-Golden Lotus/Black Lotus/Fel Lotus (World of Warcraft)
-Netherbloom/Terocones/Rain Poppy (World of Warcraft)
-Firebloom/Purple Lotus/Sungrass (World of Warcraft)
-Khadgar’s Whisker/Dragon's Teeth/Wildvine (World of Warcraft)
-Bloodthorn/Diamondglow/Fadeleaf (World of Warcraft)
-Tiger Lily/Addler's Tongue/Frost Lotus (World of Warcraft)

The Metal Seed will ensure that Reggel will grow inside the Garden, which seems to be a good source of fuel for Zoids. This implies it can be useful as fuel for biomechanical purposes. Hydromiel is apparently quite nourishing, and Dust Orchids can not only be eaten, but also ground into Dust and can pull minerals from the ground to use in forging! Moon Leaves can be used to create recreational scents, while Crystal Flowers look pretty AND can be harvested for Dust. All the other seeds are for the sake of additional foods and permutations.

However, Bloodthorne has a specific kind of sap that acts a LOT like blood, and can be used for emergency transfusions... planted here? Very nice. Diamondglow, when the leaves are dried and burned, gives off a type of smoke that calms the nerves and 'aligns the soul and the mind'. Fadeleaf is capable of being made into potions which can pierce illusions. Khadgar's Whiskers is used in potions which increase spell power and brain activity, and it’s seeds and sprouts are naturally attracted to places of great arcane promise... very nice for us. Dragon's Teeth a light ooze which glows in the presence of draconic beings, is used in a variety of transformative rituals and polymorph spells, aaaaand smells like cinnamon. Wildvine allows people to enter 'dream' realms, a potion that restores mental and physical energies... and can augment the effects of other crafts when rooting and augmenting base materials.

Kingsblood and Arthas' Tears just makes for super awesome pigments when ground up. Dreaming Glory also has a nice, deep pigment called 'Nether Pigment', but is also used for regenerative effects. Stormvine when made into a dye occasionally bristles with bright sparks of electricity, which transmit the same to any clothing dyed with it. Rain Poppy can be used to induce rainfall in a ritual, with its dye made from its petals causing a piece of dyed clothing to emit a constant mist. Golden Lotus... oh boy. This aids GREATLY in achieving a Zen state and meditating, and is capable of transmuting a lot of energy-friendly gemstones. Dust from dried and ground-up Golden Lotus can also be infused in armor and jewelry, making them a magnet for nature magics and energies, and increasing the passive luck of the wearers. Pigments made from these plants have a golden radiance as well! 

Firebloom augments all spells that generate even a little bit of heat, grows wild in volcanic locations, can be used to pacify elementals and spirits, and is used to create a philosopher’s stone, which isn't made of souls BUT can still augment the effects of a transmutation. Purple Lotus is the other plant used to make a Philosopher’s Stone, but it also scares away the undead, augments the effects of Wildvine, and creates a Dreamless Sleep Potion which is more or less like Astral Traveling. Sungrass... ho boy, Sungrass. Aside from the potions one can make, it can also affect the attributes of other plants; the trees actively shelter those who come under their branches, the fruit-bearing plants grow hardy and strong, and their fruits are venerated for healing capabilities as well as taste.

Tiger Lily, Addler's Tongue, and Frost Lotus are all important for making additional alchemist stones, which we can use to eventually make Titansteel. A Black Lotus can make all KINDS of wonderful little potions that may be useful. Talandra's Rose is used in a potion called the Potion of Nightmares... which you go into a deep sleep to face your inner demons/darkest fears, but it actually changes your body to reflect internal changes when confronting them. Cinderbloom can upgrade the Philosopher Stone, but can protect you permanently from intense heat if you survive eating it, and any dye made from it flickers with embers, and clothing dyed in such a manner leave a trail of glowing embers which flicker out of existence a moment later. Heartblossom works well with curing fungal infections when ground up and used as tea, as well.

Golden Sansam used in a few cooking recipes that rejuvenate the soul, and can be ground into a spice or powder that augments the flavors of citrus and meats. When made into a tea, it can also increase one’s spiritual awareness. Netherbloom can be used to make weapon oils that imbue nether energy into things, VERY useful. Terocones... ho boy. They can be used for creating healing salves and have a natural fertilizer in the outer shell that’s basically plant-steroids. Very much needed. Green Tea Leaves when burnt give off a smoke which calms the nerves of even a rampaging dragon when they breath it in, by themselves they give off a thin mist-like appearance, and when eaten raw are capable of rejuvenating the soul of even someone afflicted by a magical curse.

The Talador Orchid is even more crazy. It's used as a spice for food, but it's particularly known for being able to, when boiled with chunks of Blackrock Ore, turn the chunks of ore into Metamorphic Crystals, reagents used for further alchemical creations. Said flower also is used with a cluster of primal spirit to make a Primal Alchemic Catalyst. Which… the catalyst allows for basically taking reactions which should take thousands of years to occur and making them work within days. Enough said. The Starflower is shaped like a star and gives off a soft blue glow with a few dancing blue lights that float eternally around each blossom. It transforms True Iron into Taladite, a gemstone infused with moon energy. Yeah.

We also have Magebulbs, which can absorb latent magic from the soil it's planted in and collect it into 'dust' to be used in enchanting or other similar things. We need this so fucking much. Songbells also can make Motes of Harmony, which in turn can slowly coalesce into Spirits of Harmony... which will do wonders for our crafting. Oh yes.

We also want to add a little more pleasantness with the addition of 'Eden Seed' which while it has rare harvest times, it's JAM PACKED with nutrients and properties that can seriously help a person out. Normally it's awesome, but with the situation we're in? This thing is going to be like a fountain of youth and power, and I like it. But nothing wrong with some oddity either... the 'Jeweled Tree' can grow moon pearls, ever-warm brass, even some ruby and sapphire! Come on, that's pretty awesome.

The Weaver Worms on the other hand, we'll be researching for their silk-spinning glands and attempt to make a cotton-like and sisal-like series of plants to ensure grassilk is grown in sufficient quantities. All the while, we have Demon Ink Flower Seeds, which can be used to grant powerful abilities via tattoos. I'm sure we'll find something amazing with this... especially since we can do some mixing with 'Rift Flower Seeds', which literally has a crop of magical energy each time it blooms. Oh yes. There shall be magics here. 'Soma' is like liquid divinity that we can plant, its bountiful material restoring a man body and spirit while the 'Golden Apple' is able to restore a person's mind fully and bring it back from any sense of madness. SCORE. ...the 'Paopu Fruit Seeds' are mostly because why not.

But all we've been doing is plants, plants, and more plants. Sure we're going to have Wells soon, but what about actual water and sea life?

-Orgel of Origins (Ar Tonelico)
-Enchantments (Various settings)
-Jorium Crystals (Starcraft)
-Isle Fish (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Volcanic Spring (Dark Cloud 2)

We carve out a pretty good-sized lake. From there, we fill it up with waters born from the Jurai Trees to ensure they are as healthy as possible. From there, we plant a great deal of plants and let the mana from the Tomb and from Yggdrasil cause them to grow bountifully. But we can do better. By planting various enchanted Songstone devices in various places throughout the seabed, and weaving Song Magic with the 'Mother Lullaby', we can cause a great deal of music to come from the lake and even grow as magnificent as it can be. Speaking of growing, 'Isle Fish' are as big as a small island and fly around land as well... so we can throw one in and try to breed it. Get some fish going in here!

A modified Orgel of Origins will provide all the power needed for these enchantments to last, with any additional power left over used to power the various technologies the Harvest Sprites might end up using along with the Elemental Fonts gained from World of Warcraft. The Trees will also assist in maintaining and monitoring this power for the Lake of Melodies, to ensure our small breed of Super Sea Snails can live here. But we can't just have cold water. Nearby we can have a 'Volcanic Spring' so that others can instead of going for cold swims all the time can enter some really nice, warm springs and become healed from it all!

Speaking of technologies the Harvest Sprites could use...

-Setup Wizard (Harry Potter)
-Doll Maker of Bucuresti (Touhou)
-Magitech (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Magitech (Thundercats)
-Technosorcery (Gargoyles)
-Moon Tech (Okami)
-The Magic of Science (The Witcher)
-Device Meister (Lyrical Nanoha)
-Digitized Sorcery (Fate/Extra)
-Manadrives/Antimatter Manipulation Principle (Final Fantasy 13)
-Antimatter Temporal Principle (Final Fantasy 13-2)
-Crystal Mechanics (Final Fantasy Type-0)
-Crimson Saint (Maoyuu Hero and Demon King)
-Mechanist/Magitek Mastery (Final Fantasy VI)
-Living Technology (Tenchi Muyo)
-Pollution Standards (Light of Terra)
-Pollution Standards (Tropico)
-Reduce Reuse Recycle (Captain Planet)

-Magitek/The Legionsx5/Garland Ironworks buff (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Ruins of the Last Age/Mythology/Azys Lla data (Final Fantasy XIV)
-Mega Bomb/Guru (Chrono Trigger)
-Tech Wizard (Devil Survivor)
-Technomage (Libriomancer)
-Trans-Am/Qan[T]-level Twin Drive (Gundam 00)
-Green Energy (Zootopia)
-Technomancy (Mage: The Awakening)

Living Technology lets us 'replace most interfaces with living wood-input devices', which is frankly amazing if we're going to be honest. This will potentially help us combine the facets of magic and technology to let this place live in harmony, while tossing in a few 'Pollution Standards' and 'Reduce Reuse Recycle' along with 'Green Energy' in order to truly make sure anything that comes in here is eco-friendly! To make things better, we can throw in 'Master Architek' in order to create buildings with pure crystal! Talk about friendly!

Various Magitech perks will allow you to construct various, eco-friendly items in the Garden so that you may tend to things as you see fit. 'Technomage' and 'Magitech' of both kinds, and 'Technosorcery' will guarantee this facet of our work, while 'Doll Maker of Bucuresti' ensures we can reverse engineer stuff, AND we can adequately create whatever magitech we need. On top of that, the 'Manadrives' and 'Antimatter Manipulation Principle' from FF13 will allow us to effectively analyze and recreate a form of magitech at any time... maybe throw in 'Antimatter Temporal Principle' for good measure.

But why stop there? 'Moon Tech' is yet another section we can use to increase our capacity, with 'Crimson Saint' letting us convert magic into tech... or tech into magic with a bit of help from 'Crystal Mechanics'. To boot, 'Magitek Mastery' allows us to convert any technology we have into a partially magical creation while 'Device Meister' lets us convert any technological device to run on magic, which will help it out tremendously for our little paradise. Speaking of, 'Mega Bomb' not only lets us mix magic seamlessly into our technology, but 'Guru' lets us study and delve into magic as though we were an engineer applying science... no points for guessing what we can do there. We can also seamlessly blend magic and technology even further with 'Technomancy' to truly blur the lines into something we need.

We can buff it, too. 'Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th' along with 'Magitek', five ranks of 'The Legions', and a bit of help from 'Garland Ironworks' can ensure whatever magitech we make will be so ridiculously buffed up that it is SICK. Like, it's going to be crazy. Then we have 'Ruins of the Last Age', 'Mythology', and the data from 'Azys Lla'. This means we have a good understanding of Allagan technology, which... was more or less Magitech on crack. Since we know a bunch of this stuff, it means we're in ridiculous business.

Furthermore, Jurai Trees can "have an internal folded dimensional space is tailored to the owner, and is usually large enough to support plants, animals and bodies of water. It’s about the size of a large city park, with most of the amenities woven into the clarketech nature environment." and by taking advantage of this the space inside the shack will be made larger and more comfortable for the trees to grow. We'll also be taking advantage of the Innovation properties that 'Trans-Am' and 'Qan[T]-level Twin Drive' can do, releasing vast amounts of GN particles in occasional bursts to plant the seeds of Innovation to any who enter it.

Speaking of innovation, we need to ensure that we get the most out of the technology or upgrades we place in this area.

-Simple/Advanced/Alkahestry/Truth (Full Metal Alchemist)

-Alchemy (Castlevania)
-Alchemy/Mixing Mixtures (Banjo-Kazooie)
-Alchemy (Samurai Jack)
-Alchemy (Valkyrie Profile)
-Alchemy (Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning)

-Creation Prodigy (Ar Tonelico)
-Synthesis: Rank 3/Efficiency: Rank 1 (Atelier: Arland Trilogy)
-Alchemization (SBURB)
-Alchemical Expertise (eXceed)
-Master Synthesist (Kingdom Hearts)

We have to gain as much alchemical knowledge as possible to make full use of the technology and the materials we're placing in this Garden. EVERYTHING from Full Metal Alchemist goes in, and adding things like 'Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation' and 'Master Synthesist' only further increases what we can turn shit into. 'Alchemy' from so many different places, along with 'Deranged Alchemist' from Van Helsing and 'Alchemy Knowledge' from Golden Sun not only lets us further transmute matter but it also allows us to create potions and methods to reinforce living things! This means the Trees and other such things. Speaking of reinforcement and enhancement, 'Synthesis' at our rank lets us not only increase the effects of the item but it also adds on a small additional effect to help! Even lets us improve an item quality the more we make it, up to twice the amount! Better yet, 'Efficiency' lets us reduce waste along with increasing effects and quality slightly if we take our time with it. Say, if it can reinforce the MAGITECH that's within the Garden that would be just keen! We can also mix together technologies and help get a better idea of how to synthesize items together through the use of 'Alchemization' in order to get the most bang for our buck, too. Save space by making everything awesome!
 
'Equivalent Exchange' and 'Transmutation/Alchemy' will further increase our knowledge and what we can do, especially if you bought the material from Minecraft to work it to its fullest... and since Fate-style magic is total bullshit, it will only increase what we can do in time. And wouldn't you know it, 'Creation Prodigy' is also a form of transmutation and alchemy! We want to work as much as we can, as hard as we can. To tinker with the composition of the materials, to ensure our equipment is grand in function and form. Everything down to the molecular state must be taken into account, which is why we're also adding 'Mixing Mixtures'... which lets us mix our alchemical potions together without any risk of conflicting problems, which is pretty good if we're using these potions to treat the plants or the technology. 'Alchemical Expertise' is even more bullshit though... if we find out everything ever about an object, no concerns or questions and able to explain everything... we could start taking traits from it and start imbuing other things with those traits! That is absurdly useful. Very useful.

Now it's time to do our Wells, and with that we will need the following:

-Water of Life (Jurai Trees; can rapidly heal the drinker)
-Bismarck's Blessing (FF13, any flora/fauna that comes into contact grows five times their normal size)
-Elemental Pollution (Water) (Captain Planet)
-Amrita Supply (Etrian Odyssey; replenishes spiritual energy)
-Regenerating Bottle of SCP-006 (SCP Foundation)
-Node Mastery/Book of the Elements (Masters of Magic)
-Cheat Mode: FIRE ANT (Water) (SimAnt)
-Chi (Lego- Legend of Chima; enough chi orbs infuses the waters)
-Soul Smith (Dark Souls; lets you use spiritual energy instead of souls for things)
-Spiritia Abundance (Macross)
-Spirit Font (Jade Empire; font of spiritual energy/chi)
-Puddle Terrors (World of Warcraft)
-Bottled Lazarus Water (Arrowverse)

The 'Bismarck's Blessing' water with the 'Chi' and the 'Water of Life' shall be used in every pool, in equal proportions, to ensure they work together with the 'Artificial Blastia Core' and keep the Trees in an abundance of health. However, the 'Amirta'/'Spiritual Energy'/'Spirita/'Spirit Font' shall be saved for the final pool, underneath the Yggdrasil tree. There will also be a great infusion of spiritual energy using spirit energy from Yu Yu Yakusho, Bleach, and Dark Souls. The 'Tomb of Sucellus' will also be placed in this area, so as to ensure the Life Mana and vitality it gives will be saturating the trees and any life within it with the Yggdrasil tree giving off an abundance of Nature mana. Combied with 'Node Mastery' letting us double the output of any Node, and 'Book of the Elements' letting us turn sources of natural power INTO Nodes, the landscape and world itself will be very, VERY powerful and enriched.

But to speed things along, we're using 'Elemental Pollution' from Captain Planet, in order to quickly produce MUCH more 'Bismarck's Blessing' water and speed up our Well Water productions as well. We're also going to be adding 'SCP-006' to each pool along with the 'Bottled Lazarus Water' to ensure they're effectively each 'Fountains of Youth' to guarantee any that the waters touch will heal and revitalize them. But how do we ensure each pool of water is mixed effectively? Well, 'Cheat Mode: FIRE ANT (Water)' lets us eventually mix different liquids inside ourselves to create a perfect mix! So we'll just be doing that.

We're not going to let these things just remain as they are, though. We need to make sure each pool has a caretaker. So grabbing some 'Puddle Terrors' or finding a way to summon them is paramount. Why? Because they're juvenile water elementals, and they can become the waters they're placed in. They also help purify waters, which will help with preventing any contaminants that may threaten our Wells.

But in order to ensure our trees can SURVIVE the intense energies of these different sources, we need to make sure the Trees can absorb and manipulate as many varied energies as possible. We will need the following:

-Hybrid/Jagan Eye (Yu Yu Hakusho)
-Upgraded Geneforge (Geneforge)
-Item Creation A+++ (Fate/Extra)
-Living Technology (Tenchi Muyo)
-No Sell (Tsukihime)
-VWES (Megaman X)
-Weapon Copy System (Megaman Classic)
-Demigod Atelier/Mantra Reactor (Asura's Wrath)
-Fear Tech (Monsters Inc.)
-Jakara-type Spyrer Armor (Light of Terra)
-Virus Creator (Megaman Battle Network)
-Gadget Master (007)
-Tinkerer (RWBY)
-Transformium (Transformers)
-Specialty: Mechanics/Engineering (Transformers)
-Master Builder (Transformers)
-Miniaturization/Efficiency (Worm)
-Nano-technician/Nanoforge (Red Faction)
-Sohon (Legacy of the Aldenata)
-Nanite Sciences/Nanite Removal and Control (Generator Rex)
-Weapons Recombination Template (Final Fantasy XIII-2)
-Hybridization Theory (Zoids: Legacy)
-Nanotech Wizard (Ratchet & Clank)
-Plug 'N Play (Kamen Rider: Neo-Heisei)
-They're Like Legoes, Right?/This Is How I want It (Kerbal Space Program)

By using this combination, we analyze the energy-absorbing machinery of the Spyrer Armor and study it enough so that we may convert it and the Mantra technology into Living Technology, which will not only make it interface with wood but make it compatible with the trees. The VWES/Weapon Copy System added in will ensure it has extra adaptability, and with the Miniaturization/Efficiency power, we can make it small AND much more capable, giving no issues to the Trees. If possible, we need to give 'No Sell' over to the trees somehow as well, drastically reducing the effect of anything that might harm them to give enough time to let them adapt and thrive. We'll also be using 'Fear Tech' modified to work off the emotions and related energies being stored in the Garden, while also monitoring and helping maintaining a proper balance in sync with the Mantra technology. We also need to use 'Plug 'N Play' to install some tech onto the Trees, to make sure they can regulate the energy being sent over to us and make sure nothing goes wrong.

We then take samples of oneself, studying blood and the 'coding' utilized in oneself to find the traits used for Hybrid Spiritual Energy and how the Jagan Eye works before using Living Technology and the Geneforge to craft a wooden version to place inside each tree. With this, the Trees also have absolute mastery of their own energies along with the ability to absorb different versions, allowing for modifications to the Wells or the Garden. Virus Creator will ensure we can download new viruses into the Trees to impart new abilities as needed.

We also need to make sure the technology we use will be able to work in confined spaces. 'Nanotech Wizard', 'Nano-technician', 'Nanite Sciences'/'Nanite Removal and Control', and 'Sohon' is a good start to understand and control the nanotechnology that will go into this, while 'Gadget Master' and 'Miniaturization/Efficiency' will ensure it is much, MUCH more effective than a machine of its size would be. Additional boons like 'Tinkerer', 'Weapons Recombination Template', and 'Hybridization Theory' will further improve the space we have for shoving things inside, which is good! It's very very good. We can also use 'They're Like Legoes, Right?' and 'This Is How I Want It' to design some truly absurd modular technology, which will be in demand if we want to save space on this beast of an upgrade.

Honestly though, we need to ensure these nanites and methods of adapting to the energies are in tip-top condition. Let's glance at everything:

-Xenotechnology (STALKER)
-Technician/Core Competence (Spiral Knights)
-Fitting into a Mould: Scientist (Gravity Rush)
-Peak ADVENT Technology (XCOM 2)
-Hands of Icarus (Heaven's Lost Property)

'Orokin Tech', 'Asgardian' Tech, and 'Demigod Atelier'... the works. Like, we're talking the works. We want everything we can to ensure these things are simply amazing. Throwing in 'Divine Machines/Chosen of Death' will only improve the sheer clarketech-style advancements we can make to ensure top-grade mechanics. 'Special Attention', 'Mechanical Master', and 'Maker's Prodigy'/'Maker' will additionally help us out with quality, because... well, let's face it. We're shoving these things into the trees. We NEED to make sure we're god on it.
 
On top of that, we need to be able to provide modifications to these improvements when needed. 'An Order To Things', 'Xenospecialist', 'Certified Tech', 'Independent Innovation', 'upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!!', 'Tech Expert', 'Xenotechnology' and 'Xenoarchaeologist' will let us essentially understand about anything we find with enough time, which will provide a massive boon to our ability to stay ahead of the game. We're always going to find new things, so it is extremely important that we can adapt to them and not find ourselves destabilized.

But at the same time... well, we need to make sure all this stuff will last. Like, to make it REALLY last.

-Craftsman of the Gods (Viking Saga)
-Expert Smithing (Ragnarok Online)
-Technical Expertise (Iji)
-Remodelling (Medaka Box)
-Glove of the East (Binbougami ga)
-Soul Smith (Dark Souls)
-Daedalus' Student/Titan's Blood (God of War)
-Soulcraft/Sage (Demons' Souls)
-Feel It Out/Synchronicity Event (F.E.A.R.)
-Master Craftsman (King Arthur)
-Special Attention (Gundam AGE)

-Panzerkampf (Sabaton)
-Deity's Weapon/Weapon Synthesis (Warrior's Orochi)
-Ambrosial Artificer (Macross)
-Fixer Upper (Dark Cloud 2)
-Lathe of Heaven (Chrono Trigger)

Every bit of nanites and machinery we make for the trees, even if it's wood, will be masterful. It will be of superb quality, and will be far more powerful than it would originally be. To make it even better, 'Expert Smithing' allows it to be be 'affixed' MULTIPLE times so long as we have enough energy to use. This will guarantee it has additional properties and adaptability to guarantee both its survival and its capability. On top of that, 'Deity's Weapon' and 'Weapon Synthesis' both from Warriors Orochi can ensure that the more we use something or try to draw it out, the better enhanced it will become and the more its inherent properties will be magnified.

To boot, the 'Mythical Forge' from Jade Empire will enhance abilities by 50% AND allow them to use their fullest potential. But we want to go further. By using further combinations, we can guarantee the nanites will never malfunction from regular use, and will last for a very, VERY long time. Easily in the thousands of years. TENS of thousands, even. We do not want to have maintenance on these things, for as long as possible. On top of that, 'Ambrosial Artificer' and 'Fixer Upper' will ensure we can discard unneeded parts while improving the ones we DO need! Combining those with the 'Lathe of Heaven' ability that lets us maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses... well. Let's just say we're really playing for keeps.

But what about the virtual side of things? After all, we have the 'Net Sphere Reformation Device' being laced and installed all around, we need to control it! So let's grab some things:

-Net Sphere Engineer/Netscape Navigator (Blame!)
-Hardened Cosmosphere (Ar Tonelico)
-App Master (Soul Hackers)
-Superscale Skills (Evangelion)
-VR Construct Hub (The Matrix)
-Holotable (Marvel Cinematic Universe)
-Control Cube/Holographic Computer (Tenchi Muyo)
-Nullspace Computer (Megas XLR)
-Union Core (Arpeggio of Blue Steel)

'Net Sphere Engineer' allows us to construct objects in virtual space, while the 'Netscape Navigator' can make it so visitors aren't feeling daunted or demanded to modify themselves just to visit the place. We can also use 'Hardened Cosmosphere' to augment the digital construction abilities of the 'Net Sphere Engineer', for having a second layer doesn't mean we can just let it go hog-wild. There must be balance. The 'VR Construct Hub' will ensure we have additional coding and technology capable of operating this second layer while 'Superscale Skills' and 'App Master' can let us organize the infrastructure we will need for it all... both outside and in.

But how to monitor it or let either side communicate with each other? Well, 'Holotable' can potentially help with projecting images as needed, with the 'Holographic Computer' to further assist on that due to its dimensional capabilities. The 'Control Cube' and 'Nullspace Computer' will further assist us, being versed in dimensional communications and interactions... buuuut just to be safe, let's use the technology of the 'Union Core' to round off any communication or projection ability we may need to monitor both sides.

Now to finally imbue our waters, we need to go to World of Warcraft and collect water from the following:

-Sunwell (ignited after the Shattered Sun Offensive)
-Moonwell Water (various places across Night Elf lands)
-Well of Eternity (a vial from Vashj and Kael'thas, a larger amount from the Caverns of Time instance of the same name)
-Second Well of Eternity (from the Well under Nordrassil)
-Felwell water (corrupted water in Felwood)
-Well of Lost Souls (font underneath the Black Temple)
-Six Sacred Pools of Power (from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms)

The Sunwell water and the two Vials shall be placed in one Well. The Moonwell Water and water from the Second Well of Eternity shall be in the second Well. The Felwell and Well of Lost Souls shall be used for the third Well, and the water from the Caverns of Time instance shall provide the fourth and purest Well. Water from both Wells of Eternity will be used to ignite the Spirit Well underneath Yggdrasil, to ensure an abundance of spiritual energy. But the six Sacred Pools that represent powerful emotions and superb healing abilities... the samples of those that are replicated will be placed in a large circle around the trees.

But do we really want to end our waters there? We can add more!

Using 'Universal Adapter', we are capable of creating a device that can 'translate' energies right over to another form. Using 'Miniaturization/Efficiency' from a prior modification, we make it much more capable, and from there we use 'Crimson Saint' along with 'Crystal Mechanics' to slowly convert it from a machine into a spell after we have worked it inside and out. Then using our original Well materials to dig and craft the Wells needed, and proceed to make additional Wells for Fortune Energy and Shinsoo... Fortune Energy specifically so that way the entire Garden eventually undergoes Deification, turning the entire place into an actual divine realm.

The Dust Well will have a fair amount of Dust Water mixed in, made partially magical so it can fall under the purview of the Adapter. Jorium Crystals lining the walls, 'Water of Life' from Five Star Stories, and the energy from 'Psionic Waveform' will be used for one of the Psychic Wells while the energy from being an Eldar will make up the other Psychic Well, using 'Psychonautics' to ensure the energy is stable before using it. We can also take the chaos energy from the 'Fake Chaos Emerald' and use that in a well too! Sweetness.

We're also going to be extracting some energy from ourselves to make some additional Wells. What kind? Well 'Wakfu' for starters, as it's a nice life force that can reinforce things. We're also going to be also extracting the 'Chakra' energy within ourselves, and using THAT to make another Well to try and see if we can't get some of that going. Try to buff things up a bit, you know?

Also a 'Phonic Energy' Well. Because why not? It's Phonic Energy, it's music made manifest. Sooooooooo what we can do is line the walls of a Well with 'Songstone', put a single 'Orgel of Origins' in the middle, then fill it up with adapted Well Water made of 'Phonic Energy' to fuel any Symphogear Relics we may possess. We'll also be using 'Argent Power' and 'Empowered by the Well' to make a nice ol' Well made of Argent Energy. Gotta keep things nice and varied, right?

We're also going to make a 'Spiral Energy' Well. But why? We're only capped at Simon's level at the end of the LordGenome arc, right? So why do so? It's still something that's quite potent, and it's the power of Evolution in a can, which should work well with the EVO crystals we had. The 'Blue Crystal' stores evolution energy, while the 'Yellow Crystal' can allow access to potential biological forms. We're just going to etch these into the Well's walls in a Spiral form, and install a grooved drill in the center of the Well to keep slowly spinning and ensure the water keeps spinning in a spiral pattern. Of course, this drill is going to be the 'Lambda Driver', because it's a machine designed to manifest willpower, right? Well Spiral Energy is a sign of that. Ergo, it can interact. Ergo, it can REGULATE the output of the Well to make sure things don't go insane.

Speaking of making sure things don't go insane, mixing together 'A Vial of Glowing Water' along with some Wells in places could help us out. How? Well it can purify things such as the Shibito zombie things. This means we could possibly be able to literally make 'Purification Wells' that will also help regulate and ensure that things don't get too insane. Which... will be needed, as making a 'Violet Energy' Well to ensure we have enough energy of love is going to do interesting things. We'll also be making the glorious power of friendship with 'The Power Cosmic' letting us put Cosmic Energy into a Well! Friendship and evolution for all!

The Prana Well... that's going to be a bit more tricky. Nasuverse mechanics state that Prana is comprised of two things: Mana and Od. But 'Mana' is produced by nature, which means our Prana Well is going to turn into a Mana Well soon enough. We're going to need a supply of Od if we want actual Prana. We need to do some work. Specifically, we use 'Artificer' from Tsukihime to abuse the hell out of Etherlite, which is something of a magical, artificial nervous system. But they can also be used as Magic Circuits, which means they can conduct magic. What we do is we study the hell out of Life Fibers, then produce them using techniques from our 'Mosaic Organ' we got from Terra Formars, while intertwining them with the Etherlite. Why is this important? Well, as a 'Mazone' we're kind of like a plant. Which means we're fully capable of producing Life Fibers that actually work on plants.

We then use these plant-like 'Ether Fibers' to weave into our various trees (either weave them in at only 30% maximum, or splice them in), which in a sense would grant them Magic Circuits... and since Royal Trees are quite sapient, they should count enough as living beings to start creating Od within themselves, which they can use with the Mana in the air to begin Prana production.

We then want to think of other things... like Protein Energy! It helps a person get fit, increases willpower and healing! It can even let you shoot lasers! So a Well of this stuff would help. Speaking of lasers, 'Elite Beat' grants Rhythm Energy, which can revitalize people, cause good fortune, and other such things... while 'Love and Peace!' can let it be changed into other forms. Fun! But more importantly? The 'Elite Beat Pen' turns the energy into a fine laser, increasing efficiency and directing it well. ...we're going to find how it works using the technology/crafting perks shown above, then put this in ALL OF OUR WELLS.

Whatever happens from there, happens.
