# CELESTIAL PACK - COMBINED QUICK REFERENCE v2
## Son of Cosmos: JumpChain

---

## CRITICAL: WAREHOUSE MECHANICS

**ALL Celestial Pack perks default to WAREHOUSE location.**

The Warehouse is an extradimensional storage space accessible ONLY to the Jumper (Sheldon). Gardens, farms, meat fields, and magical plants exist there—NOT on Masaki property, Tsukino property, or any in-universe location.

**What observers see:** Sheldon disappears briefly, returns with goods (meat, produce, herbs).
**What they don't see:** The source. Ever. Unless Sheldon explicitly explains.

**FORBIDDEN in narrative:**
- Characters discovering meat trees on property
- Visitors touring the Warehouse gardens
- Plants visibly growing near the Masaki carrots
- Any indication the magical farms are physically present in-universe

## Philosophy

> **"Have the skill and not need it instead of need the skill and not have it."**

## THE DIGIMON MEAT GARDENS

**LOCATION: WAREHOUSE ONLY**

### Meat Field (200 CP) - Digimon World Next Order
Daily harvest of tenderloins, porkchops, crispy bacon, t-bone steaks, turkey legs.
Perfectly seasoned, piping hot, off the branch.

### Carnivore Patch (100 CP) - Digimon World Re-Digitize
Grows meat instead of fruit. Three meals per guest per day.

**Narrative use:** Sheldon has mysterious, inexhaustible grocery supply. Nobuyuki wonders where he gets premium cuts in rural Japan, 1989. Answer: pocket dimension. But Sheldon just says "I have my sources."
