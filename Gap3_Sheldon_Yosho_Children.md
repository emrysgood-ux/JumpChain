# SHELDON-YOSHO CHILDREN — COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
## Gap 3 Resolution: Son of Cosmos
## Compiled December 29, 2025

# OVERVIEW

Sheldon and Yosho have biological children through advanced technology. This document compiles all confirmed information and flags inconsistencies requiring author decision.

# TIMELINE INCONSISTENCY (REQUIRES DECISION)

Two different timelines appeared in past conversations:

| Version | First Child | Second Child |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Version A** | ~2015-2020 | ~2020-2025 |
| **Version B** | 2028 (Year 39) | 2030 (Year 41) |

**Context:**
- Wedding occurs ~2025 (Year 36)
- If Version A: Children born BEFORE formal wedding
- If Version B: Children born AFTER wedding (2028 = Year 39, 2030 = Year 41)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Version B makes more narrative sense:
- Wedding formalizes relationship (~2025)
- Newlywed period (2025-2027)
- First child (2028)
- Second child (2030)
- Tenchi age at children's birth: 44-46 (established adult, clear generational separation)

# CONFIRMED DETAILS

## Creation Method

**Technology:** Kryptonian Birthing Matrix (from Celestial Comic Book pack)
- Combines genetic material without biological pregnancy
- Allows two male parents to have biological children
- Precise genetic blending
- Safe development outside a womb

**CRITICAL:** Sheldon built the Birthing Matrix himself as a surprise for Yosho. He is a genius physicist with four legitimate PhDs — the grants enhance his existing intelligence, they don't create it.

**Washu's Role by Birth:**

| Birth | Builder | Primary Monitor | Washu's Involvement |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Achika** | Sheldon | Sheldon | Informed AFTER gestation began; observer only |
| **Mamoru** | Sheldon | Washu (by request) | ASKED to participate — wanted to learn from a system she didn't invent |
| **Future** | Sheldon | Washu assists | Ongoing collaboration at her request |

**Significance:** The greatest scientific genius in the universe encountered technology a human physicist built that she hadn't thought of herself. Washu's involvement in later births comes from humility and curiosity, not because Sheldon needed her help.

## Genetic Inheritance

### FROM YOSHO (Juraian Royal Line):
- Extended lifespan (centuries, not millennia)
- Juraian power potential
- Light Hawk Wing capability (1-3 wings maximum)
- Royal Tree bonding potential
- Physical traits: hair colors, eye colors, bone structure

### FROM SHELDON (Human + Cosmos):
- Human emotional depth
- Cosmic resonance (minor, emotional-trigger only)
- "Peaceful cosmic scent" — subtle blessed aura
- Physical traits: skin tones, hair textures, facial features

### WHAT THEY DO NOT INHERIT:
- Sheldon's full cosmic power (13 LHW, Lambda)
- Agelessness (they will age, slowly)
- Cosmos station/title
- Lambda Power

## Lifespan Classification

**Category:** Juraian Royal — potentially VERY long-lived

**Canon Facts (from tenchi.astronerdboy.com):**
- "A member of the Royal Family can live thousands of years."
- "With Washu's technology, this can be much higher. For example: Misaki and Tenchi will still be around for hundreds of thousands of years."
- Normal Juraians have human-equivalent lifespans; ROYAL family members with tree bonds live far longer.

**Children's Lifespan Estimate:** Thousands to hundreds of thousands of years (with tree bonding and available technology)

**Key Point:** Yosho died at ~1,700 years by CHOICE — he was ready. That's a personal decision, not a species limitation. The children could easily outlive him by millennia if they choose.

**Aging Pattern:**
- Normal childhood development
- Slow aging after maturity (appearing young for centuries)
- With tree bonding: effectively indefinite lifespan
- Without tree bonding: still thousands of years as royals

## Possible Third Child

**Status:** CONFIRMED — template exists, plus additional children beyond

**Suggested Traits (from past conversations):**
- Coily white or silver hair (Sheldon's texture + cosmic coloring)
- "Mischievous genius" personality

## Additional Children

**Status:** CONFIRMED — "several more" beyond the third

**Details Needed:**
- Total number of children
- Names, genders, birth years
- Individual traits and personalities
- Birth spacing (every 2-3 years? Longer gaps?)
- When do they stop having children?

**Note:** Over a 1,000-year timeline with effectively unlimited lifespans, family size could be substantial.

# TIMELINE OF CHILDREN'S LIVES (ASSUMING VERSION B)

| Year | Child 1 Age | Child 2 Age | Event |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 2028 | Born | — | First child arrives |
| 2030 | 2 | Born | Second child arrives |
