### Part 2: Scenes 51-100

**POV:** Sheldon (exclusive)  
**Timeline:** 15:01:01 JST — 15:30:00 JST  
**Coverage:** Field Crossing → Treeline → Road Arrival

---

## SCENE 51
**Time:** 15:01:18 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, walking south

He tested the hypothesis.

Ten strides, counted carefully. The ground that passed beneath his feet covered more distance than ten of his old strides would have managed. His legs were longer. His gait was wider. The proportions of this body did not match the proportions he'd memorized over thirty-seven years of inhabiting himself.

How tall was he now? He had no mirror, no measuring stick. The question joined the others waiting for answers.

---

## SCENE 52
**Time:** 15:01:35 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, walking south

The sun warmed the back of his neck.

Afternoon light in spring, filtered through atmosphere that carried none of the haze he'd grown accustomed to in Fairbanks. Clean air. Mountain air. The temperature registered as comfortable—neither warm enough to produce sweat nor cool enough to notice his lack of a jacket.

Perfect weather for being reborn in a field.

The thought arrived with unexpected humor. He filed it away.

---

## SCENE 53
**Time:** 15:01:52 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, walking south

His shadow stretched before him at an angle, pointing generally southeast. Mid-afternoon, spring latitude, northern hemisphere.

He could calculate his approximate position from the shadow angle if he had a stick and time. But the road to the south would answer the question faster than geometry.

*Practical first. Theoretical later.*

Another of Dorothy Mae's lessons, delivered over algebra homework when he was eleven.

---

## SCENE 54
**Time:** 15:02:09 JST  
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field, walking south

The flowers thinned as he approached the field's southern edge.

Grass remained, but the sumire gave way to other plants—clover, something with small white blooms he didn't recognize, the beginnings of what looked like wild radish going to seed. The careful cultivation that had produced the chrysanthemum field ended in a ragged transition to common meadow.

Someone had planted those flowers. Someone maintained that field.

He was walking away from whatever significance that location held.

---

## SCENE 55
**Time:** 15:02:26 JST  
**Location:** Field edge, approaching treeline

The treeline rose before him, closer than it had appeared from his waking position.

Cedar. Definitely cedar—the distinctive scale-like leaves, the particular red-brown of the bark. And maple interspersed among them, new leaves bright green against the darker evergreen backdrop.

A forest, or at least a substantial wood. The undergrowth looked managed, not wild—trimmed back from the field edge, leaving a clear boundary between cultivated and natural.

---

## SCENE 56
**Time:** 15:02:43 JST  
**Location:** Field edge, approaching treeline

He angled west slightly, avoiding the direct path into the woods.

The road lay south, and the most direct route would skirt the treeline rather than push through it. No path was visible—no gap in the vegetation suggesting regular human passage. Easier to go around than through.

His navigation instincts worked automatically, processing terrain, calculating efficiency, selecting optimal routes. Whatever else had changed, his mind still functioned like his mind.

---

## SCENE 57
**Time:** 15:03:00 JST  
**Location:** Field edge, skirting treeline

The shade from the trees fell across him in stripes.

Cool air moved between the trunks, carrying the scent of cedar and decomposing leaves. The forest breathed, exhaling the particular smell of places where sunlight reached the ground only in patches.

He could hear water somewhere within the trees. A stream, small from the sound of it. Moving south, toward the road he sought.

---

## SCENE 58
**Time:** 15:03:17 JST  
**Location:** Field edge, skirting treeline

His ears worked perfectly.

The realization came the same way the vision had—through contrast with expectation. He'd had minor hearing loss in his left ear since a childhood illness, a slight deficit that made him favor his right during conversations.

Now he heard equally from both sides. The water burbled in perfect stereo. The bird—still calling, fainter now with distance—reached him without the characteristic muffle of his old auditory asymmetry.

Everything fixed. Everything optimized.

---

## SCENE 59
**Time:** 15:03:34 JST  
**Location:** Field edge, skirting treeline

The field curved southeast, following the contour of the land.

He adjusted his course to match, keeping the treeline on his left and the open grass on his right. The ground began to slope more noticeably downward—not steep, but perceptible. He was descending from whatever elevation the field occupied.

The road should appear soon. He could hear vehicles now, distant but regular. The sound of tires on pavement, engines working through gears.

---

## SCENE 60
**Time:** 15:03:51 JST  
**Location:** Lower field, approaching road

The treeline ended.

He emerged around the woods' southern edge to find the land opening before him in a wide sweep of grass and agricultural terracing. Rice paddies, flooded and planted, stretched across the valley floor in geometric precision. The road he'd heard ran along the paddies' northern edge, a two-lane strip of gray asphalt cutting east to west.

Civilization. Such as it was.

---

## SCENE 61
**Time:** 15:04:08 JST  
**Location:** Lower field, approaching road

No sidewalk lined the road. No streetlights. No painted lines marking lanes.

Rural Japan. 1989, if his documents spoke truth. Before the infrastructure investments of the nineties would reach places like this. Before convenience stores and vending machines colonized every corner of the country.

A white van passed heading west, moving at moderate speed. The driver didn't appear to notice the man standing at the edge of a field.

---

## SCENE 62
**Time:** 15:04:25 JST  
**Location:** Lower field, fifty meters from road

He descended the final slope toward the road.

The grass gave way to packed earth, then to gravel, then to the cracked pavement of a drainage channel that ran parallel to the asphalt. He stepped over the channel and stood on the road's shoulder, looking both directions.

East: the road curved into distance, disappearing around a forested hill. No signs visible.

West: straighter, running along the paddy edge. Something that might be a structure perhaps half a kilometer away.

---

## SCENE 63
**Time:** 15:04:42 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, surveying

The structure to the west clarified as he studied it.

Small. Open-fronted. A bench visible inside.

A bus stop.

The logic assembled itself: bus stops implied bus routes, which implied regular service, which implied destinations. If he could catch a bus, he could reach a town. If he could reach a town, he could find food, shelter, information.

He turned west and began walking along the road's edge.

---

## SCENE 64
**Time:** 15:04:59 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, walking west

The pavement felt solid beneath his shoes.

Harder than the field. Less forgiving. His legs adjusted automatically to the change in surface, his stride shortening slightly to accommodate the different texture. The body knew things his conscious mind hadn't taught it—either remembered from a previous existence or programmed by whatever force had placed him here.

He didn't examine the implications too closely. Walking required attention. Philosophy could wait.

---

## SCENE 65
**Time:** 15:05:16 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, walking west

A car passed, heading east.

Small sedan, white, Japanese plates. The driver—an elderly man—glanced at him without interest and continued on. Either foreigners were common enough here to warrant no special attention, or the man simply had other concerns.

He watched the car recede in the distance, carrying someone who existed in this time without question or confusion.

---

## SCENE 66
**Time:** 15:05:33 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, walking west

The rice paddies caught the afternoon light.

Water mirrored the sky in each flooded field, broken only by the precise rows of young rice plants pushing up through the surface. The paddies had been planted recently—the seedlings stood barely a hand's width above the waterline. Spring planting. Early April, if he remembered the agricultural calendar correctly.

April 1989. Cherry blossom season just ending. The new year barely begun by the old calendar.

---

## SCENE 67
**Time:** 15:05:50 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, walking west

He passed a small shrine set back from the road.

Stone base, wooden structure, faded vermillion paint. Too small for formal worship—a roadside shrine, the kind that dotted rural Japan in numbers beyond counting. A guardian of travelers, perhaps. Or a marker of some long-forgotten event.

He didn't stop, but he noted its presence. Shrines meant communities. Communities meant people. He was heading in the right direction.

---

## SCENE 68
**Time:** 15:06:07 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, walking west

The bus stop grew clearer with each step.

Wooden construction, open on three sides. A bench inside, dark with age and weather. A sign mounted on a post, kanji characters identifying the stop and listing destinations.

He could read the sign from here. His vision—perfect now—resolved the characters at a distance his old eyes would have rendered blurry.

The stop served a local route. Destinations included names he didn't recognize. None of them mattered yet.

---

## SCENE 69
**Time:** 15:06:24 JST  
**Location:** Road shoulder, walking west

A schedule would tell him when to expect a bus.

If the schedule existed. If it was current. If buses still ran in the late afternoon. Variables multiplied, each one potentially fatal to his simple plan of reaching civilization.

He walked faster. The bus stop was close now, close enough that he could see the schedule board mounted beside the route map.

---

## SCENE 70
**Time:** 15:06:41 JST  
**Location:** Approaching bus stop

The shelter's shadow fell across him as he arrived.

He stepped inside, out of the afternoon sun, and turned to examine the schedule board. Columns of times, rows of destinations, a grid of service patterns that took a moment to parse.

The next westbound bus would arrive at 15:45. Forty minutes from now, if his watch remained accurate.

He could wait.

---

## SCENE 71
**Time:** 15:06:58 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, examining schedule

The route map showed a network of stops spreading across the region.

Small towns connected by thin lines. Major roads marked in red, minor routes in blue. A larger destination to the west—Kurashiki, the name suggested. Not a village but a city of some size.

He didn't need a city. He needed information. The nearest stop might provide enough.

The route terminated to the east at a place marked with a shrine symbol. Masaki Shrine, the name read.

---

## SCENE 72
**Time:** 15:07:15 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, examining schedule

Masaki.

The name triggered nothing. No memory, no recognition, no sense of familiarity. Just another shrine in a country that contained thousands of them, each serving its local community, each maintaining traditions that extended back centuries.

But his documents placed him in Okayama Prefecture. The schedule board confirmed this. And the property deed in his wallet showed an address in this area.

He was, according to his constructed identity, a local. This was supposed to be home.

---

## SCENE 73
**Time:** 15:07:32 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

He sat.

The bench was harder than it looked, the wood worn smooth by generations of waiting passengers. His body folded into a seated position with the same easy grace that had characterized every movement since waking. No protest from knees. No complaint from hips.

Forty minutes until the bus. Time enough to think.

---

## SCENE 74
**Time:** 15:07:49 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

What did he know?

He had died. Of that, he was certain. The cascade failure at the UAF accelerator had been instantaneous and total. No survival was possible. The physics allowed no alternative interpretation.

He was alive. Equally certain. His heart beat. His lungs expanded. His brain processed sensory information and generated thoughts about that information.

The two certainties contradicted each other. Something had resolved the contradiction. What?

---

## SCENE 75
**Time:** 15:08:06 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

He had been moved in time.

The evidence supported this conclusion. His documents showed a 1959 birth year. The technology visible in passing vehicles suggested late 1980s manufacture. The agricultural cycle indicated spring. The calendar math worked out to 1989.

From 2025 to 1989. Thirty-six years backward.

Not merely resurrected—displaced. Relocated to a different point in the timeline.

---

## SCENE 76
**Time:** 15:08:23 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

He had been given a new identity.

Tsukino Sheldon. Not Carter. The Japanese family name suggested a Japanese mother—his documents confirmed this. Tsukino Yuki, deceased 1985. His father remained American, but the primary lineage had shifted.

A half-Japanese physicist named Sheldon, thirty years old, permanent resident of rural Okayama. The identity was specific. Detailed. Too complete to be improvised.

Someone had planned this.

---

## SCENE 77
**Time:** 15:08:40 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

He had been given a new body.

This remained the strangest part. Not the time displacement, which at least fit within theoretical frameworks he'd spent his career exploring. Not the identity, which could be forged.

The body. His scars erased. His defects corrected. His proportions altered. Everything functioning at a level he'd never experienced.

Bodies couldn't be rewritten. Not with any technology he knew. Not with any physics he understood.

---

## SCENE 78
**Time:** 15:08:57 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

Therefore, something he didn't understand had occurred.

The conclusion was unsatisfying but honest. He was a scientist. When evidence contradicted theory, the theory had to give way. When phenomena exceeded explanation, the explanation was incomplete.

He didn't understand what had happened to him. That didn't mean it hadn't happened.

He would gather more data. He would revise his models. In time, understanding would follow.

---

## SCENE 79
**Time:** 15:09:14 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

For now, immediate concerns took priority.

He needed shelter. The documents suggested he owned property, but he didn't know where that property was or how to reach it.

He needed food. His body felt fine—no hunger yet—but that would change.

He needed information. What year, what month, what day. What this place was. What his supposed life had been.

The bus would help with all of these.

---

## SCENE 80
**Time:** 15:09:31 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

Another car passed, heading east.

Red, this time. A compact model he didn't recognize. The driver paid him no attention, absorbed in whatever errand justified driving through rural Okayama on a weekday afternoon.

He watched the car until it disappeared around the curve, then returned his attention to the road in the opposite direction. The bus would come from the west. He would see it before it arrived.

---

## SCENE 81
**Time:** 15:09:48 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

Time passed.

He sat without fidgeting, without restlessness, without the low-grade anxiety that usually accompanied waiting. His mind remained calm, his body still, his attention divided evenly between internal processing and external observation.

The patience felt unfamiliar. He'd never been good at waiting. Always too many projects, too many ideas, too many calculations demanding attention.

Now waiting felt... possible. Comfortable, even.

---

## SCENE 82
**Time:** 15:12:15 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

A truck passed, heading west.

Small flatbed, loaded with crates that might have held vegetables. The driver was a woman, middle-aged, wearing a broad-brimmed hat against the sun. She glanced at him as she passed—a longer look than the previous drivers had given.

He raised a hand in acknowledgment. She didn't respond, but something in her expression softened before she returned her attention to the road.

---

## SCENE 83
**Time:** 15:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

Footsteps approached from the east.

He turned to look. An elderly woman making her way along the road's shoulder, carrying a cloth bag in one hand and using a walking stick with the other. Her clothing suggested local—simple dress, practical shoes, the kind of apron Japanese farm women had worn for generations.

She was heading for the bus stop. Another passenger waiting for the 15:45 departure.

---

## SCENE 84
**Time:** 15:16:04 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, sitting on bench

The woman entered the shelter and sat at the opposite end of the bench.

She studied him openly—not rude, but curious. A foreigner at a rural bus stop warranted examination. He met her gaze without challenge, offering a small nod of acknowledgment.

"Konnichiwa," she said. Good afternoon.

"Konnichiwa," he replied. The word came easily, his accent unremarkable.

Her eyebrows rose slightly. She hadn't expected fluent Japanese.

---

## SCENE 85
**Time:** 15:16:38 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"You speak well," she said. A statement, not a question.

"Thank you." He kept his response simple. His Japanese was fluent—he'd learned it for academic purposes, spent summers in Kyoto improving his comprehension—but he didn't know how to explain that fluency to a stranger.

"Where are you going?" Direct questions, the privilege of age.

"I'm trying to reach my house. Near a shrine, I think. The name is—" he hesitated, recalling his documents. "My family name is Tsukino."

---

## SCENE 86
**Time:** 15:17:12 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

Her expression changed.

Recognition, perhaps. Or something else—a sharpening of attention, a reorganization of whatever assumptions she'd made about him.

"Tsukino," she repeated. "The house by Masaki Shrine."

"You know it?"

"Everyone knows it. The house has been empty since..." She paused, choosing her words. "For some time."

---

## SCENE 87
**Time:** 15:17:46 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"Since my mother died," he said, testing the constructed history.

The woman's face softened. "Yuki-san. Yes. You're her son."

The statement carried weight. Not a question—a recognition. Whoever Tsukino Yuki had been, she'd been known here. Her death had been noted. And somehow, this stranger's face prompted the connection.

"I've been away," he said. True enough, in a sense.

"A long time," she agreed. "You've grown."

---

## SCENE 88
**Time:** 15:18:20 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

He didn't know how to respond to that.

Grown into what? From what? The woman saw continuity where he saw rupture. She remembered a child who had become the man before her. He had no such memory.

"The shrine," he said, redirecting. "How far is it?"

"The bus goes there. Last stop on the eastbound route." She gestured toward the schedule board. "But you knew that."

He hadn't known that. But he nodded anyway.

---

## SCENE 89
**Time:** 15:18:54 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

"Masaki Katsuhito still tends the shrine," the woman continued. "He'll know you've returned. The mountain doesn't keep secrets."

The mountain doesn't keep secrets. A strange phrase. He filed it away for later examination.

"Thank you," he said. "For the information."

"You're Yuki-san's son. Of course I would help." She settled back on the bench, her examination apparently complete. "Welcome home, Tsukino-san."

---

## SCENE 90
**Time:** 15:19:28 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, with elderly woman

Welcome home.

The words settled into him with unexpected weight. He wasn't home. He didn't know where home was. The constructed identity in his wallet might claim this place, but his memories held nothing of it.

And yet.

Someone had built him a home. A family. A history. A place to belong.

He would go to the shrine. He would see this Masaki Katsuhito. He would learn what he could about the life he'd been given.

---

## SCENE 91
**Time:** 15:22:47 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, waiting

They sat in comfortable silence, the old woman and the stranger who was apparently not strange to her.

The afternoon continued its slow decline. Shadows lengthened imperceptibly. The rice paddies glittered in the angled light. Somewhere behind them, in the hills he'd descended from, the uguisu still called its three-note song.

He waited. She waited. The bus would come.

---

## SCENE 92
**Time:** 15:28:33 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, waiting

Dust rose on the western road.

He looked up, tracking the disturbance. A vehicle approaching, larger than the cars that had passed. The particular dust pattern of a bus, heavy enough to disturb the gravel shoulders.

The woman gathered her bag, preparing to stand. "On time," she said, as if this were noteworthy.

"That's good," he agreed.

---

## SCENE 93
**Time:** 15:29:15 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, watching bus approach

The bus materialized from the dust.

Cream and orange livery, small by American standards, the rounded shape characteristic of Japanese local transit. The destination sign above the windshield showed kanji he could now read: 真咲神社 — Masaki Shrine.

His destination. Someone had arranged that too, probably.

---

## SCENE 94
**Time:** 15:29:47 JST  
**Location:** Bus stop, bus arriving

The bus slowed, hydraulics hissing as it settled beside the stop.

The driver was a man in his fifties, uniformed, professional. He glanced at the waiting passengers—one elderly woman, one foreign man—and opened the door without comment.

The woman boarded first, producing exact change from her bag. The bus accepted coins with mechanical clicking.

He reached for the loose change in his pocket.

---

## SCENE 95
**Time:** 15:30:04 JST  
**Location:** Boarding bus

The steps were steep, designed for shorter passengers.

He climbed them easily, his new body's longer legs finding the spacing uncomfortable but manageable. The driver watched him without obvious reaction—neither welcoming nor hostile, simply professional.

He fed coins into the fare box. The machine accepted them, displayed a total, dispensed his change.

The driver nodded toward the rear of the bus. Seating was open.

---

## SCENE 96
**Time:** 15:30:21 JST  
**Location:** Bus, selecting seat

The elderly woman had taken a seat near the front, on the left side facing forward.

Other passengers occupied scattered positions throughout the vehicle—a farmer in work clothes, a schoolgirl with a heavy bag, an elderly man asleep against the window. None of them looked up as he boarded.

He chose a seat in the middle, right side, where he could watch the road ahead.

---

## SCENE 97
**Time:** 15:30:38 JST  
**Location:** Bus, seated

The seat was harder than expected.

Vinyl covering, minimal padding, the utilitarian design of vehicles meant to move bodies rather than comfort them. His back pressed against the backrest without the usual negotiation his old spine would have required.

The bus lurched forward, engine settling into working rhythm. Through the window, the bus stop receded.

---

## SCENE 98
**Time:** 15:30:55 JST  
**Location:** Bus, departing

He was moving toward something.

The field where he'd awakened lay behind him now, invisible beyond the trees and hills. The property deed in his wallet pointed toward a destination. The woman's recognition suggested he would be expected there, or at least that his arrival would not be entirely unexpected.

Tsukino Sheldon, returning home after a long absence.

He would have to learn to be that person.

---

## SCENE 99
**Time:** 15:31:12 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

The countryside unrolled beyond the window.

Rice paddies gave way to dry fields, then to forest, then to paddies again. Small houses clustered at intervals, their roofs showing the distinctive tiles of rural Japan. Farm equipment parked beside barns. Laundry drying on lines. The ordinary infrastructure of ordinary lives.

None of it was ordinary to him. All of it was new.

---

## SCENE 100
**Time:** 15:31:29 JST  
**Location:** Bus, in motion

The radio played softly at the front of the bus.

Japanese pop music from what sounded like the mid-eighties—he couldn't identify the artist, but the production style placed it within a decade. A woman's voice singing about summer, about waiting, about the kind of longing that made good lyrics and poor philosophy.

He listened without really hearing, his attention divided between the window and his own thoughts.

The bus carried him east, toward the shrine, toward the house, toward whatever waited for him in this life he hadn't chosen but had been given anyway.
