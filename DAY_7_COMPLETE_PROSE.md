**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino  
**Location Sequence:** Shrine Residence → Shrine Grounds → Village (walk) → Shrine Residence  
**Weather:** Clear, 18°C high, 10°C low, calm  
**Sunrise:** 5:44 AM | **Sunset:** 6:31 PM

## SCENE 1: SLEEPING IN
**Time:** 06:45:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, guest room

His body had decided to rest.

He woke later than any morning since arriving—nearly seven o'clock, an hour past his usual rising. The uguisu had sung its three notes and moved on to other territories. Daylight filled the room through shoji screens that had been gray with pre-dawn when he normally saw them.

No work today. Yamada had been explicit: Sundays were rest days, non-negotiable, the rhythm of a traditional craftsman whose weekly cycle predated the Western workweek but had accommodated itself to similar patterns.

Sheldon lay still, examining the sensation of having nowhere to be. The construction site waited at the Tsukino house, tarped and secured, but it would wait until Monday. The shrine residence operated on its own schedule, Katsuhito's routines absorbing the household rather than demanding adaptation to external timing.

*Rest*, he told himself. *Your body needs it, even if it doesn't complain.*

He rose eventually, folded the futon, dressed in casual clothes rather than work wear. The distinction felt significant—different clothing for different purposes, the fabric itself signaling what the day would contain.

## SCENE 2: LATE BREAKFAST
**Time:** 07:30:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Tenchi had already eaten.

The boy sat on the engawa when Sheldon emerged, playing with what appeared to be small wooden blocks—not building, exactly, but arranging them in patterns that held meaning only to their arranger.

"Good morning, Sheldon-san! You slept late."

"I did. My body needed rest."

"Grandfather said that happens when people work hard. Their bodies ask for more sleep." Tenchi considered this information with the seriousness of someone cataloging adult wisdom. "Does your body talk to you?"

"In its own way."

"How?"

Sheldon settled onto the engawa near the boy. "Tired muscles. Hunger. Thirst. The body communicates through sensations rather than words."

"I don't hear my body talking."

"You're young. Your body doesn't need to ask for much yet. When you're older, and you've used it more, the conversations become more frequent."

Tenchi absorbed this with the particular attention he gave to information that suggested the future held experiences he couldn't yet imagine.

Katsuhito appeared with rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables. "You slept well?"

"Better than I expected."

"The body knows what it needs, when permitted to take it." He set the food before Sheldon. "Eat. Then, if you wish, you may help with shrine maintenance. Sunday brings visitors."

---

## SCENE 3: SHRINE VISITORS
**Time:** 09:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, main grounds

The visitors came from the village and beyond.

Not crowds—the Masaki Shrine served a small community, its significance local rather than regional—but a steady trickle of people climbing the three hundred twenty steps to offer prayers, seek blessings, or simply fulfill habits their families had maintained for generations.

Sheldon watched from a position near the main hall, uncertain of his role. Katsuhito had suggested he observe first, participate later, learn the rhythms before attempting to match them.

The visitors varied. An elderly woman who climbed slowly but steadily, pausing on every twentieth step to catch her breath. A young couple with a toddler, the father carrying the child while the mother carried offerings. A middle-aged man alone, his expression suggesting prayers more serious than routine observance.

Each followed similar patterns: purification at the water basin, approach to the offering box, clapping, bowing, silent communication with whatever they believed the shrine represented. The specifics of their prayers remained private, but the structure was shared.

"The shrine serves the community," Katsuhito said, appearing beside Sheldon. "Not through doctrine, but through presence. People need places where their prayers feel heard."

"Do you believe they're heard?"

"I believe the act of praying changes the one who prays. Whether something else listens is beyond my knowledge."

---

## SCENE 4: GROUNDS MAINTENANCE
**Time:** 10:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, approach path

"The leaves must be swept. The paths must be clear."

Katsuhito handed Sheldon a bamboo broom—traditional design, the kind that had swept shrine grounds for centuries. The tool felt unfamiliar but not wrong in his hands.

"Sweep with the growth of the bamboo, not against it," the priest instructed. "The motion should be natural, not forced."

Sheldon attempted the technique. The broom moved across stone with a rhythm that required learning—not difficult, exactly, but different from the utilitarian sweeping he'd done in previous contexts.

"Slower," Katsuhito observed. "You're not racing the leaves. You're guiding them."

Adjustments. The pace dropped, the motion smoothed, the leaves began cooperating rather than scattering.

"Better. Sweep the entire approach. The exercise will teach you what words cannot."

Sheldon worked his way down the path, methodically clearing debris that had accumulated since the last maintenance. Cherry petals, mostly—the final casualties of the bloom that had ended while he was learning to remove roof tiles. The petals had dried to brown, their pink glory reduced to compost that would feed the trees that produced them.

*Mono no aware*, he thought again. The aesthetic of impermanence, applied to decomposing flowers.

---

## SCENE 5: TENCHI'S COMPANY
**Time:** 11:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, approach path

Tenchi appeared with a smaller broom.

"Grandfather said I could help," the boy announced, positioning himself near Sheldon with the determined stance of someone who intended to contribute meaningfully.

"Start at the edge," Sheldon suggested. "Work toward the center."

"Why that direction?"

"So we don't sweep the same leaves twice."

Tenchi considered the logic, found it acceptable, and began sweeping with the chaotic energy of a four-year-old whose technique hadn't yet caught up with his enthusiasm. Leaves scattered as often as they collected, but progress occurred in net terms.

"Sheldon-san?"

"Yes?"

"Why do you live alone?"

The question arrived without preamble, the way children's questions often did. Sheldon continued sweeping while he formulated an answer.

"I'm not sure I do live alone. I'm staying here now, with you and your grandfather."

"But your house. You were going to live there alone."

"Yes."

"Doesn't that get lonely?"

"Sometimes. But I'm used to it. I lived alone before—in America, where I came from."

"Did you have family there?"

The question touched something Sheldon hadn't fully examined. His family—the one he'd left behind when he died, the one that existed in a timeline thirty-six years in the future—remained inaccessible, uncontactable, separated by barriers more fundamental than distance.

"I did," he said finally. "They're far away now."

"Do you miss them?"

"Yes."

Tenchi processed this with the empathy of a child who understood absence better than he should have at his age. His mother wasn't mentioned in present tense. His father worked in Tokyo, visiting when schedules permitted.

"I'm glad you're staying with us," the boy said. "It's nicer when there are more people."

## SCENE 6: MIDDAY MEAL
**Time:** 12:30:00 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

Lunch was informal, as Katsuhito had promised.

Rice balls left over from breakfast. Pickled vegetables. Tea. The meal required minimal preparation and minimal ceremony—fuel between morning activities and afternoon ones.

"You sweep well," the priest observed. "Better than I expected for a first attempt."

"The technique isn't difficult once you stop fighting the broom."

"Most techniques aren't difficult once you stop fighting the tool." Katsuhito sipped his tea. "That applies beyond sweeping."

"Like knife work?"

"Like everything. The knife, the broom, the saw, the brush. Each tool has a nature. Understanding that nature is the first step toward mastery."

Sheldon considered the principle. His previous life had involved different tools—oscilloscopes, spectrometers, particle detectors—but the underlying logic held. Each instrument had optimal operating parameters. Fighting those parameters produced poor results.

"Is that what Yamada is teaching me? To stop fighting the tools?"

"Among other things. Yamada teaches carpentry, but carpentry includes philosophy. The best craftsmen understand this."

---

## SCENE 7: AFTERNOON WALK
**Time:** 14:15:17 JST  
**Location:** Village path, below the shrine

Katsuhito suggested a walk.

"You should see the village properly," he said. "Not just the path between the shrine and your house. The community you're joining has other dimensions."

They descended the three hundred twenty steps together, Tenchi racing ahead and circling back, his energy apparently infinite. The village spread below—traditional houses clustered along the main road, rice paddies extending into valleys, the particular landscape of rural mountain Japan.

"Two hundred households," Katsuhito said as they walked. "Perhaps six hundred people in total, though the young ones leave for cities when they grow up. The population has declined by half since the war."

"Is that common?"

"Universal, in rural areas. The cities offer opportunities the villages cannot match. Schools, jobs, entertainment, connection to the wider world." His voice carried neither judgment nor regret—simply observation. "Those who remain do so by choice, or by circumstance, or by obligation to what they would leave behind."

"Which category do you fall into?"

"All three." A slight smile. "The shrine requires a keeper. My son found his life elsewhere. My grandson—" He glanced at Tenchi, who had discovered a beetle on a fence post and was examining it with rapt attention. "His future remains unwritten."

---

## SCENE 8: THE VILLAGE CENTER
**Time:** 14:45:33 JST  
**Location:** Village main road

The village center consisted of a single road with essential services.

A small grocery that doubled as a post office. A hardware store whose inventory included everything from nails to television sets. A restaurant that served lunch to farmers and dinner to families. A shrine to the local kami, smaller than the Masaki Shrine but tended with equal care.

"Tanaka-san." Katsuhito nodded to an elderly woman emerging from the grocery. "I hope your spring planting goes well."

"Katsuhito-sama." The woman bowed with the deference accorded to the priest of a significant shrine. Her eyes moved to Sheldon with undisguised curiosity. "This is the one? The Tsukino heir?"

"Tsukino Sheldon, yes. He's staying at the shrine while his house is repaired."

"I heard about the termites. Such a shame—that house has been there longer than I've been alive." She examined Sheldon with the directness of someone whose age had earned her the privilege of dispensing with social niceties. "You have your grandmother's eyes."

The statement landed unexpectedly. Sheldon had no knowledge of which grandmother she meant, or what those eyes had looked like.

"Did you know her?"

"Everyone knew Yuki-san. She was—" Tanaka paused, searching for words. "Memorable. The American husband, the strange circumstances, the child who looked nothing like the village children. And then she left, and years passed, and now here you are."

"Here I am," Sheldon agreed, uncertain what else to say.

"Fix that house. Etsuko would have wanted it fixed properly, not left to rot."

"I intend to."

Tanaka nodded as if a test had been passed, then continued on her way.

---

## SCENE 9: BEETLE INVESTIGATION
**Time:** 15:15:22 JST  
**Location:** Village outskirts, forest edge

Tenchi had located another beetle.

This one was larger than the fence post specimen—a black body with distinctive horns that curved forward and up. The boy crouched beside the tree stump where he'd found it, maintaining the careful distance of someone who understood that observation required patience.

"*Kabutomushi*," Katsuhito said, identifying the species for Sheldon's benefit. "Japanese rhinoceros beetle. Tenchi collects them."

"They're everywhere in summer," the boy reported, not taking his eyes off his quarry. "But this one is early. Must have emerged because of the warm weather."

"Can you catch it?"

"I don't want to catch this one. It just woke up—catching it now would be mean." Tenchi's ethical framework regarding beetles apparently included considerations of timing. "I'll find others later, when they've had time to eat."

Sheldon watched the boy watching the beetle. The attention was remarkable—complete focus, no fidgeting, no urge to touch or disturb. Whatever this child would become, patience was already part of his constitution.

"He's like this with everything," Katsuhito murmured. "Bugs, birds, visitors to the shrine. He watches until he understands."

"That's unusual for his age."

"Many things about him are unusual." The priest's voice carried observation without concern. "His mother was the same. Watching, always watching, until suddenly she knew things no one had taught her."

It was the most direct reference to Kiyone that Sheldon had heard. He filed it away—another data point in the incomplete picture of this family's history.

---

## SCENE 10: RETURN TO THE SHRINE
**Time:** 16:30:17 JST  
**Location:** Masaki Shrine, approach steps

The three hundred twenty steps felt different ascending than descending.

Sheldon's legs registered the climb in ways they hadn't during earlier traversals—the week's accumulated labor making itself known, muscles that had been pushed past their normal limits now requesting consideration.

*You're not actually tired*, he reminded himself. *Your body just thinks you should be.*

The observation was accurate. Whatever his benefactor had done to his physical form, genuine exhaustion seemed to be excluded from the package. He could feel fatigue's echoes—the sensation of muscles that had worked—but the debilitation that should have accompanied them was absent.

"You climb well," Katsuhito observed, not breathing hard despite his age. "Many visitors stop three times during the ascent."

"The steps aren't as challenging as they seemed my first day."

"Nothing is as challenging as it seems the first time. Or as easy. The true difficulty lies somewhere between initial impression and earned familiarity."

Tenchi had raced ahead, already at the top, waving down at them with the impatience of youth that couldn't understand why adults moved so slowly.

"He has energy to spare," Sheldon said.

"He has energy he doesn't know how to direct. Channeling it productively is the task of everyone who raises him."

---

## SCENE 11: EVENING PREPARATION
**Time:** 17:45:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

"Tonight you cook," Katsuhito announced.

The statement arrived without preamble or explanation. Sheldon stood at the kitchen entrance, having expected to assist rather than lead.

"I don't know Japanese cooking."

"You know cooking. The principles transfer." The priest gestured at the available ingredients—rice, vegetables, a portion of fish, various seasonings. "The goal is a complete meal. The method is yours to determine."

"What if I fail?"

"Then we eat a failed meal and you learn something. Failure with dinner is not catastrophic."

Sheldon examined the ingredients, organizing them into categories. Starch: rice. Protein: fish. Vegetables: daikon, carrots, some leafy greens he'd learned to identify over the past week. Seasonings: soy sauce, mirin, various pastes and powders whose specific functions remained uncertain.

*What would Dorothy Mae do?*

She would have started with the rice. Rice required time—thirty minutes minimum from washing to completion. Everything else had to work around that anchor.

He began measuring.

---

## SCENE 12: COOKING ATTEMPT
**Time:** 18:15:33 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, kitchen

The fish presented the primary challenge.

Sheldon had never grilled fish in the Japanese manner—skin-on, bones-in, the entire preparation requiring techniques he'd only observed, never performed. He examined the portion Katsuhito had provided, trying to recall the steps he'd watched over previous dinners.

Salt first. A moderate amount, applied to both sides, allowed to sit while the grill heated. The salt would draw moisture to the surface, creating the crispy skin that characterized proper preparation.

The vegetables were simpler. Miso soup required a base—he'd seen Katsuhito prepare dashi, the kelp and dried fish broth that formed the foundation—but he hadn't paid close enough attention to replicate it confidently. Improvisation would be necessary.

*Vegetable broth*, Dorothy Mae's voice suggested. *Simmer the trimmings in water, strain, use that as the base.*

He collected the daikon ends, the carrot peels, the tough stems from the greens. Into a pot with water, brought to a simmer, left to extract whatever flavor they'd provide.

The fish went onto the grill when the rice had fifteen minutes remaining. The skin sizzled immediately—too hot, perhaps, or perhaps exactly right. He watched the edges for signs of cooking, trying to judge timing he'd never learned.

---

## SCENE 13: THE MEAL
**Time:** 18:45:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dining area

The results were... acceptable.

The rice had cooked properly—thirty minutes of experience with automatic rice cookers translated across cultural boundaries. The fish was slightly overcooked on one side but intact, edible, recognizably the product of intentional preparation. The miso soup lacked the depth of Katsuhito's version but carried flavor that came from somewhere appropriate.

"You survived," Katsuhito observed, lifting chopsticks to begin.

"Barely."

"Survival is the first standard. Excellence comes later." He tasted the fish, considered, nodded. "The salt distribution is uneven. The skin could have been crispier. But the flesh is moist, and the seasoning is present. A passing grade."

Tenchi ate without critique, his standards apparently focused more on presence of food than quality of preparation.

"Tomorrow I'll show you the fish technique," Katsuhito continued. "There are steps you missed that would have improved the result."

"I'd appreciate that."

"Good. Learning requires willingness to be taught. Some people resist—they prefer failure to instruction, pride to improvement." He returned his attention to the meal. "You don't seem to have that problem."

"I can't afford that problem. I don't know enough to be proud about what I know."

"That's wisdom, if you maintain it. Pride tends to accumulate with competence. The challenge is preventing the accumulation from becoming obstruction."

---

## SCENE 14: BATH AND REFLECTION
**Time:** 20:00:22 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, bathroom

The bath provided space for processing.

Sheldon soaked in water that had been heated by someone else's labor—Katsuhito maintained the bathhouse as part of his daily routines—and let his mind wander through the day's accumulation.

Sunday had been different. The absence of construction work had created space for other activities, other observations, other aspects of this life that the previous week's urgency had obscured. The shrine served a community. The village had history that included his family. A four-year-old boy watched beetles with the patience of a naturalist decades older.

*You're integrating*, he thought. *Becoming part of something rather than just surviving in it.*

The observation carried ambiguity he couldn't fully resolve. Integration meant belonging, connection, investment in outcomes beyond his own. But it also meant vulnerability—stakes that extended beyond personal survival, losses that could hurt in ways mere failure couldn't.

The physicist in him wanted to maintain observer distance, to document without participating, to remain a stranger in a strange land whose strangeness protected him from commitment.

The person his benefactor was shaping seemed to have different intentions.

---

## SCENE 15: EVENING CONVERSATION
**Time:** 21:00:17 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, engawa

"You're thinking about something," Katsuhito observed.

The priest had joined him on the engawa with the tea that had become their evening ritual. Stars scattered overhead, the same patterns Sheldon had observed every clear night since his arrival, yet somehow more familiar now.

"I'm thinking about belonging."

"A large topic."

"I've never belonged anywhere, really. Not in the way people describe it—the sense of place, of community, of being part of something larger than yourself." He paused, finding words for thoughts that had remained unexamined. "My work was portable. My relationships were professional. My family was distant even when they were nearby."

"And now?"

"Now I'm being fitted into a framework I didn't choose. The house, the village, the shrine, your family. Connections forming without my permission."

"Does that bother you?"

Sheldon considered the question. "It should. I've spent my life avoiding exactly this—the entanglement, the obligation, the weight of being necessary to someone else's existence."

"But?"

"But it doesn't feel like a trap. It feels like—" He searched for the word. "Architecture. Something being built that might hold weight."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "That's a better answer than most people manage when confronted with belonging. They either run toward it blindly or run from it fearfully. You seem to be observing it clearly."

"Observation is what I know how to do."

"Then observe. But don't mistake observation for distance. You can watch something and still be part of it."

---

## SCENE 16: DREAM FRAGMENT
**Time:** ~23:30 JST  
**Location:** Shrine residence, dreams

The white figure was present again.

*You're beginning to understand*, she said—or didn't say.

*Understand what?*

*Why you're here. Why this place, this family, this moment in time.*

*Tell me.*

Silence. Or not silence—presence without words, communication without content. She watched him with eyes that had watched for millennia, patient as geology, certain as mathematics.

*You'll discover it*, she offered finally. *Not today. Not this year. But you'll discover it.*

He woke with the sense of being observed by something vast and patient, something that had planned for his arrival long before he was born.
