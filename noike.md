## The Dual Nature

Noike Kamiki Jurai is unique: she contains the astral form of the female Kagato within her body.

### The Female Kagato

When Washu created Kagato from Naja Akara's DNA, the clone initially manifested as female. The male Kagato emerged later and subjugated his female half, sealing her astral form. After male Kagato's death at Tenchi's hands, the female half needed a host.

**How She Came to Noike:**
- Female Kagato's astral form was discovered by Seto
- Seto adopted an orphan girl (Noike) specifically to house this entity
- The integration was (mostly) successful
- Female Kagato sleeps within Noike, occasionally influencing her

---

## Physical Description

**Height:** 5'6" (168 cm)
**Build:** Athletic, military bearing
**Hair:** Green, short
**Eyes:** Green
**Distinguishing Feature:** Sometimes her eyes flash differently — a hint of the other presence

---

## Origin Story

Noike was orphaned at a young age and adopted by Seto Kamiki Jurai. Unlike most of Seto's "projects," Noike was chosen for a specific purpose: to serve as a vessel for the female Kagato's astral form.

### Life Under Seto

- Raised in House Kamiki with all its privileges and pressures
- Trained extensively in combat and administration
- Developed fierce loyalty to Seto despite knowing she was "chosen" for ulterior purposes
- Became a capable Galaxy Police officer
- Bonded with the 3rd-generation Royal Tree Kyoko

---

## Personality

**Surface Level:**
- Competent, professional
- Military precision
- Seemingly cold
- Dutiful

**Beneath the Surface:**
- Deep insecurity about her purpose
- Genuine care for those she protects
- Conflict between her identity and her passenger
- Desire to be valued for herself, not as a vessel

**The Female Kagato's Influence:**
- Occasional aggressive impulses
- Scientific curiosity she can't explain
- Dreams of Washu and ancient laboratories
- Moments of cold calculation

---

## The Engagement to Tenchi

**CANON:** Seto arranged Noike's engagement to Tenchi as part of her endless matchmaking schemes.

### The Arrangement
- Ostensibly to strengthen Masaki-Kamiki ties
- Actually serves multiple purposes for Seto
- Noike initially approached it as duty
- Complicated by genuine feelings that developed

### Noike's Position
She was sent to Earth to:
1. Observe the household Seto has monitored for centuries
2. Integrate with Tenchi and the other women
3. Fulfill her role as Seto's eyes and ears
4. Possibly awaken something in the female Kagato

## Galaxy Police Service

Before her Earth assignment, Noike served with distinction in the Galaxy Police:
- Efficient, by-the-book officer
- Known for successful missions
- Respected but not particularly liked (too cold)
- Used her position to gather intelligence for Seto

---

## The Female Kagato

### Who She Was
The original Kagato clone was female — a direct copy of Naja Akara. When the male aspect emerged and took dominance, he sealed his female half away.

### Her Current State
- Dormant within Noike
- Occasionally surfaces in dreams
- May have fragmented memories of Washu
- Her scientific genius is mostly suppressed
- If fully awakened, her personality would clash with Noike's

### The Danger
If the female Kagato fully awakens:
- She may try to take control of Noike's body
- She carries knowledge of Washu's greatest secrets
- She might seek revenge for 5,000 years of subjugation
- Or she might seek reunion with her "mother" Washu

---

## Phase I Constraints

**FORBIDDEN in Sheldon POV:**
- The name "Noike"
- Any reference to House Kamiki
- Any reference to the female Kagato
- Any hint of Tenchi's arranged marriage

---

## Story Integration Notes

📖 **Year 14+:** Noike arrives at the Masaki household as Tenchi's "fiancée." The household dynamics shift dramatically.

🔮 **DYNAMIC WITH SHELDON:** Noike represents organized, military precision meeting Sheldon's domestic mastery. They may find common ground in their shared preference for order — or clash over control of household management.

📖 **THE KAGATO ELEMENT:** Noike's presence brings the specter of Kagato back into the household. Ryoko's reaction to learning what Noike carries will be explosive.

📖 **WASHU'S INTEREST:** Washu will be intensely curious about Noike — she carries a piece of Washu's creation within her. This may be the closest Washu can come to understanding where Kagato went wrong.

---

## Canon Notes

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- Noike is NOT evil — the female Kagato within her is a separate entity
- She did NOT choose to be a vessel — Seto chose her
- She DOES have genuine feelings — she's not just an instrument
- The female Kagato is NOT the same as male Kagato — different personality, different goals
