| Cosmos is from different universe | Cross-universe knowledge |

## SCENE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

Before writing any scene, verify:

```
KNOWLEDGE CHECK
□ What does the POV character know at this point?
□ What do other characters present know?
□ Is anyone about to say something they couldn't know?
□ Does dialogue reflect actual knowledge states?
□ Are there knowledge asymmetries to exploit for tension?
```

### Common Errors to Avoid

| Error | Example | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Sheldon thinks "Jurai" | Day 50, hasn't learned it | Use "the old man's secrets" |
| Katsuhito mentions "Lambda" | He doesn't know the term | Use "unusual energy" |
| Tenchi asks about Ryoko | He only knows "demon" story | Use "the sleeping monster" |
| Nobuyuki references aliens | He's deliberately ignorant | Avoid topic entirely |

---

## DRAMATIC IRONY OPPORTUNITIES

### Reader Knows, Character Doesn't

| Reader Knows | Character Doesn't | Tension |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Katsuhito is Yosho | Sheldon sees "old priest" | Identity mystery |
| Ryoko is in cave | Everyone walks past it | Ticking clock |
| Tenchi will free her | Tenchi thinks it's just stories | Foreshadowing |
| Sheldon is cosmic | Katsuhito sees "anomaly" | Mutual mystery |
| Cosmos chose this universe | Sheldon thinks random | Hidden design |

### Character Knows, Reader Doesn't

| Character Knows | Reader Learns Later | Payoff |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Yosho's reasons for staying | Revealed in POV | Backstory |
| Cosmos's selection criteria | Maybe never revealed | Mystery |
| What Yosho senses in Sheldon | His POV scenes | Perspective |
