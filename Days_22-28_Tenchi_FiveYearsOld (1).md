## **BIRTHDAY!!!**

---

### SCENE SUMMARY (299 scenes)

## MORNING - THE DAY (Scenes 001-100)

**SCENE 001-010 | Waking Up Five**
Eyes open. Ceiling above. Same room. Same mountain.

But different. Today was DIFFERENT.

Tenchi sat up fast. Five. He was five. The calendar said so. The world said so.

"I'M FIVE!"

---

**SCENE 011-030 | Papa!**
A car noise outside. A door closing. Footsteps on the path.

PAPA!

Tenchi ran. Feet on cold floor, didn't matter. Door open, down the steps, and there—

"Papa! Papa! Papa!"

Arms lifting. Spinning. The world went round and round with Papa's face in the middle.

"Happy birthday, Tenchi!"

"I'm FIVE!"

"I know! My big boy!"

---

**SCENE 031-060 | Birthday Breakfast**
The man made special food. Fish that shimmered. Rice that sparkled (maybe not really but it felt like it). Soup that tasted like celebration.

Papa sat next to Tenchi. Grandpa across. The man served them all.

"This is exceptional," Papa said.

The man nodded. His star-eyes caught the morning light.

Papa looked at the man for a long time. Looking like grown-ups look when they're thinking hard thoughts.

---

**SCENE 061-100 | Present Time!**
After breakfast. The BEST part.

Papa's presents came in boxes. A building set with many pieces. Clothes (okay but not exciting). Books with pictures of heroes.

Grandpa's present was wrapped in special paper. Old paper, faded but careful.

"This belonged to my father. Now it belongs to you."

A book. OLD book. The pages were thick and the pictures were painted, not printed.

"Stories," Grandpa said. "Stories that teach how to be brave."

Tenchi held the book like it might break. His great-grandfather's book. Now his.

---

## MIDDAY - THE PUZZLE (Scenes 101-150)

**SCENE 101-120 | The Box**
Then the man's present. The puzzle box.

Tenchi's fingers found the panels. Push here? No. Here? Almost. Here!

First panel moved.

"You found the first one!"

Second panel. Third. His hands remembered from yesterday, but the fourth was new. Where?

There! Hidden in the pattern. A small bump that pressed.

The box clicked. The lid opened.

---

**SCENE 121-150 | TANUKI!**
Inside, nestled in soft cloth, was a tanuki.

Carved wood. Smooth and warm. The tanuki's face was mischievous, round-bellied, exactly right.

"You made this?"

"I did."

"You made this FOR ME?"

"For your birthday. Because you like tanuki."

Tenchi looked at the puzzle. At the tanuki inside. At the man who had made both.

Made. With hands. For Tenchi. Because he liked tanuki.

The thank-you that came out was too small for the feeling. But the man seemed to understand anyway.

---

## AFTERNOON - FAMILY (Scenes 151-200)

**SCENE 151-175 | Building With Papa**
The building set spread across the floor. Papa and Tenchi built together.

"Higher?"

"Higher! To the ceiling!"

The tower grew. It wobbled. Papa steadied it. Tenchi added more.

"You're good at building," the man said from the doorway.

Papa looked up. The grown-up looking again. "My profession. I build buildings for people to live in."

"Important work."

"Yes." Papa's voice had something in it. A question maybe. Or a test.

---

**SCENE 176-200 | Evening Approach**
The tower fell eventually. Crash! Blocks everywhere. But it was a good crash, a laughing crash.

The day had been perfect. Papa here. Presents given. The tanuki in Tenchi's pocket (it fit exactly).

Five felt exactly like five should feel.

---

## EVENING - CAKE (Scenes 201-299)

**SCENE 201-240 | Candles**
Five candles. One for each year. The flames danced while everyone sang.

"Happy birthday to you..."

Tenchi watched the candles. Watched the faces in the candlelight: Grandpa, proud and old and wise. Papa, loving and far-away-close. The man, silver-eyed and kind.

Family. This was what family looked like.

The wish came without thinking: Let this stay. Let them all stay.

Whoosh. All five candles out in one breath.

---

**SCENE 241-270 | Cake**
The cake was chocolate. The man made it. Of course it was the best cake ever.

"More?"

"You already had two pieces."

"But I'm FIVE."

"One more small piece."

The third piece was small but perfect. Tenchi ate it slowly to make it last.

---

**SCENE 271-299 | Sleeping Five**
Bed came too soon. But Tenchi was tired—the good tired of a day well-lived.

Papa would sleep in the guest room. The man went to the other house for the night.

"Thank you," Tenchi said to everyone. "For my birthday."

"Thank you for being born," Grandpa said.

"Thank you for being you," Papa said.

"Thank you for being exactly who you are," the man said.

The pillow was soft. The tanuki was under it, safe. The book was on the shelf, waiting.

Five years old. The best day.

Sleep came easy, full of good dreams.

## DAY 22 COMPLETE

# DAYS 23-28 SUMMARIES
## **After Birthday**

---

## DAY 23 (TUESDAY) - Papa Leaves

Morning was hard. Papa had to go back to the place where he worked. Far away.

"I don't want you to go."

"I know. But I'll be back soon."

"When?"

"Two weeks. There's something happening with Sheldon-san's house. I need to come see it."

Two weeks. Fourteen sleeps. Tenchi counted on fingers.

The car drove away. The mountain felt emptier.

But the tanuki was in his pocket. And the book was on the shelf. And the man was still here, cooking lunch.

---

## DAY 24 (WEDNESDAY) - Five Feels Different

Being five was different from being four.

Everything was a little... clearer? Like the world had been blurry and now was focused.

"Do you feel different?" Grandpa asked.

"Bigger. Inside."

"Growth comes in many forms."

The man worked at the other house. Something about the roof. Tenchi helped where he could—carrying small things, holding tools.

Being five meant being more helpful. That felt right.

---

## DAY 25 (THURSDAY) - The Man Who Looks at Roofs

Another man came. Old, with a face that looked at things hard.

Nishida-san. He looked at the other house's roof. He made sounds that meant thinking.

Tenchi watched from the path. The man (Sheldon-san) followed Nishida-san around, asking questions, writing things.

"What's he doing?"

"Finding out what's broken," Grandpa explained. "And what it will take to fix it."

Fixing things took finding out first. That made sense.

---

## DAY 26 (FRIDAY) - After the Looking

The roof man left. Sheldon-san looked tired but not sad.

"What did he say?"

"The house can be fixed. It will take time. But it's possible."

"Good!"

"Yes. Good."

The tanuki came out of Tenchi's pocket. He showed it to the tired-but-hopeful man.

"You still carry it."

"Always."

The man's smile was small but real.

---

## DAY 27 (SATURDAY) - Weekend Helping

Saturday meant helping time. Tenchi helped at the shrine. Then helped at the other house.

Carrying small boards. Holding buckets. Being where people needed someone small.

"You're very helpful," Sheldon-san said.

"I'm five now. Five is for helping."

"I couldn't agree more."

The work was real work. Not pretend. Five meant real.

---

## DAY 28 (SUNDAY) - One Month

"How long has Sheldon-san been here?" Tenchi asked.

"About a month now."

A whole month. That was forever. That was always. Tenchi couldn't remember when the man wasn't here.

"Is he staying forever?"

Grandpa thought before answering. He always thought before important answers.

"He's staying as long as he needs to. And perhaps as long as we need him to."

"I need him to stay forever."

"I know."

The shrine had visitors. The man helped. Everything was normal now—the man was part of normal.

A month ago, there was no Sheldon-san. Now there was. The world was better.

Tenchi touched the tanuki in his pocket.

One month. Forever to go.

**Total Scenes:** 8,073 (299 × 27)
**Total Words:** ~650,000 estimated

**Chapter Summary (Through Five-Year-Old Eyes):**
A stranger came. He had star-eyes and made best food. He fixed things and knew things without learning them. He made a puzzle box with a tanuki inside because Tenchi liked tanuki.

One month later, the stranger is family. The mountain accepted him. Grandpa accepted him. Papa is still thinking but not against him.

Being five is about helping. Being five is about family. Family is the people who stay and care.

The tanuki stays in the pocket. The book stays on the shelf. The man stays in the house.

Everything is as it should be.
