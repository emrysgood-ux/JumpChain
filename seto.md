## The Naja Akara Secret

**CONFIRMED (GXP Novels):** Seto Kamiki Jurai IS Naja Akara — Washu's best friend and scientific partner who "disappeared" approximately 5,000 years ago during a pirate attack on planet K-1190.

### Naja Akara's Original Life
- Born at the Jurai Imperial Academy approximately 20,000 years ago
- At age 21, met Washu Hakubi — chased her around campus grounds on their first meeting
- Became Washu's equal in intellect and academic standing — both in Class 6 of the Department of Philosophy
- Personality: Impulsive, mercurial temperament — teasing one moment, quick to cry the next
- Co-discovered the Mass (Masu) creatures with Washu

### The Transformation (~5,000 Years Ago)
- While researching ancient artifacts on planet K-1190, pirates attacked
- For unknown reasons, Naja ERASED HER OWN MEMORIES and REGRESSED HER AGE to approximately 6 years old
- Her body was never found — only an unidentified amnesiac child
- Juraian noble Ushio Kamiki destroyed the pirates and found the child
- Ushio adopted her into House Kamiki of the Juraian Imperial Family

### The Consequences
Meanwhile, a grieving Washu believed Naja dead. She cloned her friend from leftover DNA. That clone eventually took male form and called itself Kagato.

This means Washu's grief over losing Naja — which led to creating her greatest failure — may have been unnecessary. Naja survived.

### Memory Status (As of GXP novels)
Seto's sealed memories as Naja have begun returning. Washu now calls Seto "Naja" in private conversations.

## Origin Story (As Seto)

After adoption by House Kamiki, the girl who would become Seto was raised among Jurai's nobility. She bonded with the 2nd-generation Royal Tree Mikagami, proving that non-native Juraians can bond with Royal Trees. Her pirate-raid survival left her with an intense, lifelong hatred of pirates.

Through political skill, combat prowess, and sheer force of personality, Seto rose to become the most powerful figure in Juraian politics — arguably in the entire galaxy. The previous emperor wanted her to take the throne, but she preferred to rule from behind the scenes.

## Personality

**Sasami's Description:** "She likes to throw rocks into a pond to see how big the ripples are."

**Core Traits:**
- Manipulative but not malicious
- Enjoys chaos for its own sake
- Fiercely protective of family
- Terrifying to enemies
- Playful with those she loves
- Strategic genius

## Family

### Immediate Family
| Relation | Person | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Husband | Utsutsumi Kamiki Jurai | Head of House Kamiki |
| Daughter | Misaki Masaki Jurai | Second Empress of Jurai |
| Adopted Daughter | Noike Kamiki Jurai | Contains female Kagato's astral form |
| Grandchildren | Ayeka, Sasami | Through Misaki |

### The Marriage to Utsutsumi — A Legendary Tale
When Seto was 4,500 years old and Utsutsumi was 9 years old, during their academy days, young Utsutsumi tripped and fell on Seto while she was napping in a bush. She "teased" him by feigning weakness and accusing him of groping her. She gave him a choice: marriage or death. He claims he "chose the harder route out of habit."

Despite — or perhaps because of — their unusual beginning, they seem genuinely devoted to each other, even after thousands of years.

## Political Power

Seto is the most powerful "behind the scenes" figure in Juraian politics — arguably the most influential person in the galaxy.

- Even Emperor Azusa doesn't dare cross her
- Even the ruthless Kagato knew better than to mess with the Devil Princess
- The previous emperor wanted her as ruler — she declined, preferring shadow operations
- Her private intelligence network surpasses Jurai's official one
- Commands one of the strongest fleets in Jurai

### The Matchmaker Role
Seto has a galaxy-wide reputation as an unofficial matchmaker, arranging marriages for political reasons or simply for amusement:
- Arranged Azusa and Misaki's marriage
- Arranged Tenchi's engagement to Noike
- Helped Yosho maintain his relationship with Airi
- Constantly trying to arrange matches for Amane Kaunaq and Kiriko Masaki

## Combat Capabilities

**Personal Combat:**
Seto is a first-class warrior — literally. She would "live directly" against first-class warriors in direct combat. She earned the "Devil Princess" title not just through politics but through devastating victories against pirates.

### Mikagami — The Royal Treeship

**The Mikagami Trauma:**
Royal Trees do not like to fight. The first time Seto used her ZZZ "surrender or die" command in battle, Mikagami was forced to attack, destroy, and kill many enemies. The mass killing caused a severe negative reaction from Mikagami that fed back to Seto, putting her in a coma-like state for months. This led to the creation of the Mirror Warrior.

---

## Mirror Warrior (Kuis Panta)

When Seto went into her coma, Jurai needed someone to take her place. They created a rare "Mirror Warrior" — a complete copy of Seto with the same memories, abilities, and personality. Unlike a normal Shadow Warrior (spy), a Mirror can bond with Mikagami.

- Mirror Seto operates under the alias "Kuis Panta" when not impersonating Seto
- Allows Seto to be in two places at once — one can rest while the other is active
- Originally identical through periodic memory synchronization

**Critical Notes:**
- Mirror Seto does NOT have access to the Naja Akara memories
- Mirror Seto developed separate feelings for Seina Yamada — kept private
- The two Setos are gradually becoming more distinct individuals

---

## Phase I Constraints

⚠️ **FORBIDDEN:** Seto CANNOT appear directly in Phase I (1989-1992). Her name, title, "Devil Princess," "Oni-hime," and all Juraian political references are FORBIDDEN in Sheldon's POV.

**Background Presence (April 1989):**
- Her intelligence networks actively monitor Earth (via Minaho)
- Receives reports on Tenchi's development and wellbeing
- Maintains the "death script" deception regarding Kiyone with Airi
- Aware of Yosho's true location and identity
- Represents "the watching galaxy" — powerful forces monitoring Masaki Shrine from afar

---

## Narrative Function

Seto represents the vast political machinery that exists beyond Earth — the galactic powers who know exactly what the Masaki household contains and are content to let it exist undisturbed for now.

Her shadow presence creates dramatic irony: the reader knows Earth is watched, but Sheldon cannot.
