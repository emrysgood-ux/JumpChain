**Dr. Clay Arc (OVA 2 Episodes 7-12):**
| Event | Timing | Notes |

### THE TRANSFORMATION — DETAILED

**Canon Household Formation:**
```
Tenchi alone + grief
    ↓
Women arrive, chaos
    ↓
Romantic competition
    ↓
Gradual family (slow, conflict-heavy)
```

**Found Family Formation:**
```
Sheldon arrives (Year 1)
    ↓
12 years of family building
    ↓
Women arrive to EXISTING structure
    ↓
Integrate as family, not rivals
    ↓
Accelerated healing, stability
```

**Character Role Shifts:**

| Character | Canon Role | Found Family Role |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Ryoko | Primary love interest | Chaotic aunt, healing |
| Ayeka | Rival to Ryoko | Proper aunt, reunited sister |
| Sasami | Household cook | Kitchen partner, youngest |
| Washu | Mad scientist | Grandmother, investigator |
| Mihoshi | Comic relief | Family friend, lucky charm |
| Ryo-Ohki | Pet/ship | Mascot, carrot enthusiast |

**Why This Works:**
- Tenchi has support, not isolation
- Women find home, not competition
- Sheldon's presence de-escalates
- Lambda Infusion promotes healing
- Family exists; they join it
