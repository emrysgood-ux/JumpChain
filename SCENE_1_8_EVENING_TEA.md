## SCENE 1.8: EVENING TEA

**April 3, 1989 — ~20:45 JST**
**Location:** Main residence engawa
**POV:** Sheldon (close third)

---

The engawa was cool beneath him, the wood polished smooth by generations of sitting exactly where he sat now.

Katsuhito had brought the tea to the veranda rather than a sitting room—"The evening is mild," he'd said, "and the stars are worth seeing"—and now they sat side by side, looking out at the darkness. The shrine grounds were quiet, the buildings just visible as darker shapes against the sky. Above them, stars scattered across the black like spilled salt.

Sheldon sipped his tea. It was different from the afternoon's offering—lighter, slightly bitter, the kind of tea that seemed designed to settle the mind rather than stimulate it.

"What do you see?" Katsuhito asked.

Sheldon looked at the sky, trying to understand the question. "Stars. The mountain. Darkness."

"And?"

He looked more carefully. The stars were bright here—brighter than anything he remembered from his previous life, certainly. No city lights to compete with. No ambient glow to dilute the darkness. Just the stars themselves, scattered across the sky in patterns he almost recognized.

"Orion," he said, finding the constellation. "The belt, there. And... Sirius, I think. The bright one, low on the horizon."

"You know the stars."

"I know some of them. My grandmother used to point them out when I was young. She said her grandmother had done the same for her—different stories, maybe, but the same stars."

Katsuhito nodded slowly. "The stars are one of the few things that truly connect us to our ancestors. They saw what we see. They wondered what we wonder. The distance between us and them is nothing compared to the distance between us and the stars."

Sheldon turned the idea over in his mind. It was the kind of thought he would have dismissed once—poetic but impractical, the sort of thing scientists learned to set aside in favor of measurable reality. But sitting here, under this sky, in this place he'd never been before and couldn't explain arriving at, the words felt different.

"My grandmother believed in Heaven," he said. "Up there, among the stars. She said the people we lost were watching us from the sky."

"And what do you believe?"

The question was gentle, without judgment. Sheldon took another sip of tea before answering.

"I believe I don't know enough to believe anything. I thought I understood how the universe worked. I spent thirty years studying the laws that govern matter and energy, the rules that determine what is possible and what isn't." He paused. "And then I woke up in a field with no memory of how I got there, and everything I thought I knew became insufficient."

"Ah." Katsuhito's voice held something that might have been approval. "That is a good beginning, Tsukino-san."

"A beginning of what?"

"Understanding." The priest set down his cup. "The wise man knows that he knows nothing. The fool believes he knows everything. You are somewhere in between—you once thought you knew, and now you are learning that you did not. That is uncomfortable. But it is also necessary."

The stars turned slowly overhead—too slowly to see, but Sheldon knew they were moving. Everything moved. Everything changed. Even the things that seemed permanent were only persistent.

"What should I do?" he asked. "Tomorrow. The day after. All the days after that."

"What do you want to do?"

"I don't know."

"Then do what is in front of you." Katsuhito rose, collecting both tea cups with practiced ease. "Sweep the steps. Tend the grounds. Help with the cooking. Learn the rhythms of this place. The wanting will come when you are ready for it."

Sheldon stood as well, his body unfolding from the seated position with the same unsettling ease that had marked all his movements today. "And if it doesn't?"

The priest looked at him—really looked, with eyes that seemed to see more than the surface.

"It will," Katsuhito said. "The mountain does not accept people at random, Tsukino-san. You are here for a reason. The reason will reveal itself when it is ready."

"You keep saying that. The mountain accepted me. What does that mean?"

"Goodnight, Tsukino-san." Katsuhito smiled and turned toward the interior of the house. "Sleep well. Tomorrow begins early."

He was gone before Sheldon could ask again.
