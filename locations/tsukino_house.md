**13.8 --- The Tsukino Property (Old Tsukino House)**

Per Infrastructure Integrity Law: Sheldon's ID shows a TSUKINO address,
which is SEPARATE from the MASAKI shrine residence. This section
documents that property.

Location & Address

Official address: The address on Sheldon's ID card and family registry

Location: \~300 meters from Masaki Shrine, down the mountain, near
Miya-no-shita bus stop area

Relation to shrine: Tsukino family historically had connection to
shrine; property is NEAR shrine, not AT shrine

How locals describe it: 'The old Tsukino place' or 'Tsukino-ke no ie'
(Tsukino family's house)

Current State (April 1989)

Occupancy: EMPTY --- unoccupied for approximately 8-10 years

Last residents: The main Tsukino family branch moved to Osaka in early
1980s for work

Ownership: Still technically owned by the Tsukino family (distant
relatives); not sold

Maintenance: Minimal; neighbors occasionally check on it; roof intact
but needs work

Condition: Habitable but not immediately livable --- would need
cleaning, repairs, utilities restored

Utilities: Water and electric disconnected; would need to be reconnected

Furnishings: Some old furniture remains; covered in dust cloths; nothing
valuable

Physical Description

Structure: Traditional Japanese farmhouse (minka); single story; dark
wooden exterior

Age: Built \~1920s; repaired several times over decades

Size: Modest --- main room, two smaller rooms, kitchen area, engawa
(veranda)

Roof: Traditional tile; some tiles missing or cracked; needs attention

Garden: Overgrown; once had vegetable plot and small ornamental garden

Condition details: Shutters weathered; engawa boards soft in places;
fusuma (sliding doors) intact but faded

Atmosphere: Melancholy but not ruined; a house waiting for someone to
return

Tsukino Family History (Local Knowledge)

**What locals like Katsuhito and Yamamoto Takeshi would know:**

Original family: Tsukinos have been in this area for many generations;
farmers, some worked at shrine

Connection to shrine: Historical relationship --- Tsukinos helped
maintain shrine, attended festivals, some intermarried with local
families

Main branch: Moved to Osaka \~1980-1981; father got factory job;
children needed better schools

Current status: They still technically own the house; pay minimal
property taxes; visit rarely (maybe once every few years for Obon)

Rumors: Some say they might sell it eventually; others say they're
keeping it 'for someday'

*📝 Cosmos created the Tsukino lineage cosmically, but the HOUSE and its
history are real local infrastructure that locals remember.*

Why This Matters for Day 1

Sheldon's ID: Shows THIS address --- the Tsukino house address, not the
Masaki shrine

When Sheldon shows ID: Yamamoto Takeshi and Katsuhito both recognize
'Tsukino' and know the property

The problem: The house is empty and not immediately habitable

The solution: Katsuhito offers hospitality at shrine residence ---
practical kindness, not magical coincidence

This creates: A reason for Katsuhito to invite Sheldon to stay; a
mystery (why does he have this address?); a future plot element (will
Sheldon ever live there?)

Infrastructure Integrity Check

**⚠️ CRITICAL: The Tsukino address is NOT the Masaki residence. These
are SEPARATE locations. Sheldon's documents point to an empty house, and
he ends up at the shrine through Katsuhito's hospitality, not because
his address magically matches where he needs to be.\*\***

**13.9 --- Full Tsukino Holdings (Sheldon's Inheritance)**

Cosmos didn't just create a family name --- she created a complete
family LEGACY with real property. Sheldon doesn't know the full extent
yet.

Property 1: The House (Known)

Status: Sheldon has seen it (Day 2). Knows it needs repair. Considering
renovation.

Documentation: Address on his ID; locals recognize it

Property 2: The Shop in Kamogata (NOT YET KNOWN)

Name: 月野屋 (Tsukino-ya) --- 'Tsukino Shop'

Location: Kamogata town center, 47 Honmachi --- on the main shopping
street, three doors from Ito General Store

Type: Small general store / sundries shop --- sold everything from rice
to household goods to preserved foods

Building: Two-story traditional wooden structure; shop on ground floor,
storage above

Size: Approximately 40 square meters of shop floor; cramped but
functional

History: Opened by Tsukino Genzō (grandfather) in 1925; operated 63
years; closed 1988 when last caretaker died

Current state: Shuttered; dusty but intact; fixtures remain; some stock
left on shelves

Ownership: Tsukino family; taxes paid through Kiyoshi's account in Osaka

Local memory: Older villagers remember 'Tsukino-ya' --- Haruki Ito
definitely knows it; his shop was competitor-neighbor

Potential: Could be reopened; provides income stream; natural
integration point with village commerce

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Sheldon does NOT know about this yet. He discovers it
through the deed or town hall or villager mention.\*\***

Property 3: Agricultural Land (NOT YET KNOWN)

Location: Adjacent to Tsukino house, extending south toward the valley;
borders forest on west side

Size: 0.4 hectares (approximately 1 acre) --- modest but significant

Parcels: Two connected plots: vegetable garden area (0.15 ha) directly
behind house; larger field (0.25 ha) beyond

Current state: Fallow for 10+ years; overgrown with weeds but not
forest; soil still viable

Former use: Mixed vegetables, some rice; supplemented family diet and
shop stock

Water: Small irrigation channel from hillside stream; needs clearing but
functional

Potential: Sheldon's future garden domain; connects to cooking arc;
could support significant production

Neighbors: Yamamoto Takeshi's rice fields visible to the east; natural
connection point

The Deed and Discovery

Where the deed is: In the Tsukino house, in a chest or cabinet with
family papers

What the deed shows: All three properties --- house, shop, land ---
registered to Tsukino family

How Sheldon finds it: While cleaning out the house (Day 3? Week 2?); OR
at town hall when dealing with utilities

Alternative discovery: Villager in town mentions 'the old Tsukino shop'
and Sheldon says 'What shop?'

Reaction: Surprise that his inheritance is larger than expected; more
questions about the family Cosmos created

*📝 This discovery should feel organic, not infodumped. Let it emerge
through natural story progression.*

Why This Matters Narratively

Income: Sheldon needs a way to earn money long-term; the shop provides
this without feeling contrived

Integration: A shop in town = daily interaction with villagers = faster
community acceptance

Skills: Celestial Pack cooking/preservation grants + shop = natural
business opportunity

Independence: The shop gives Sheldon his OWN domain, separate from the
shrine

Symbolism: Cosmos gave him not just a name but a LIVELIHOOD --- a
complete life infrastructure

*🔮 FORESHADOW: The shop discovery is a major revelation. It changes
Sheldon's understanding of what Cosmos prepared for him.*

Future Potential

Short-term: Sheldon lives at shrine; discovers full inheritance scope

Medium-term: Renovates house; considers reopening shop; begins farming
land

Long-term: Shop becomes community fixture; Sheldon known as 'the
shopkeeper who cooks'; house becomes his home

Symbolic: Represents the family Cosmos created for him --- real
infrastructure waiting to be activated
