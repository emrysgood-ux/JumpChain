Shrine Grounds Overview

Temizu-ya (Purification Fountain) --- Detailed

Location: At edge of path, just before torii gate, at base of 320 steps

Structure: Wooden roof on four posts; provides shade and shelter

Basin: Stone, worn smooth by centuries of hands; rectangular,
waist-height

Water source: Pipe shaped like dragon's open mouth; constant thin stream

Water quality: Cold --- underground spring source; clean, drinkable

Ladle: Bamboo, traditional hishaku style; rests across basin edge

Sound: Gentle splashing; first sound Sheldon hears after bus leaves

Ritual: Right hand takes ladle, pours over left; switch, pour over
right; rinse mouth; clean handle

*📝 Sheldon drinks first (desperate thirst), then performs proper
ritual. He'll do it correctly 'next time.'*

Funaho Tree --- Detailed

True nature: First-generation Royal Tree of Jurai; Yosho's partner;
permanently rooted

Appearance: Appears to be ancient Japanese cedar; far larger than any
natural tree

Trunk: Wider than Sheldon is tall; massive, ancient, deeply rooted

Branches: 'Like arms embracing the sky' --- spreading outward in all
directions

Presence: The most 'present' thing Sheldon has ever seen; occupies its
space completely

Sheldon's impression: 'The shrine was built around this tree, not the
other way around'

Location: Center of main courtyard; everything else arranged around it

Secret: Contains power to generate Light Hawk Wings; connected to
Tsunami; Sheldon doesn't know this

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Sheldon feels 'something stir in his chest' when first
seeing the tree --- early Lambda resonance?*

Main Courtyard --- First Impression

Surface: Raked gravel, well-maintained; patterns visible from careful
sweeping

Size: Wide, open; perhaps 30 meters across

Layout: Funaho tree at center; main building across from steps;
residence to right; storage to left

Lighting: Paper lanterns hang from main building eaves; unlit in
afternoon

Atmosphere: Quiet, sacred, carefully tended; sense of great age and
continuous care

First sounds: Voices --- one low (Katsuhito), one high (Tenchi) ---
before Sheldon sees anyone

The 320 Steps --- Climb Experience

Sheldon's physical experience climbing to the shrine, step by step:

*📝 Total climb time: approximately 15 minutes including two brief
pauses. Arrival at top: \~4:52 PM.*

Torii Gate (Shrine Entrance)

Location: Base of mountain, \~50 meters from Jinja-mae bus stop

Appearance: Vermillion (faded from weather), wooden, traditional style

Condition: Old but maintained; paint worn in places; wood weathered;
warm where sun touches

Significance: Marks boundary between ordinary world and sacred space

Path beyond: Packed earth, \~20 meters to base of steps; bordered by low
stone walls

Forest: Cedar and maple press close on either side; something with white
flowers

Priest Residence --- Interior Layout

The traditional Japanese home where Katsuhito, Tenchi, and (now) Sheldon
live. Established through Scene 8.

Construction: Traditional wood and paper; aged timber smell; tatami
mats; fusuma sliding doors

Character: Lived-in, not museum-like; worn from decades of daily use;
creaky floorboards announce movement

Main hallway: Narrow; connects all rooms; floorboards creak in places

Main room: Low table with floor cushions; where meals are eaten; warm
with cooking heat and lamplight

Kitchen: Gas range, hanging pots; visible through half-open door from
hallway; functional, not fancy

Bathroom: End of hallway, last door on left; traditional ofuro (see
below)

Katsuhito's room: First door on right from main room; traditional
8-tatami room; minimal possessions; futon stored in closet during day;
small shrine to ancestors in alcove

Tenchi's room: Second door on right; 6-tatami room; toys scattered;
futon often left unmade; drawings taped to walls; nightlight by door
(afraid of dark)

Spare room: End of hall on right; the room with the squeaky door; now
Sheldon's (see below)

*📝 Thin walls mean sound carries. Sheldon hears Katsuhito's evening
movements, Tenchi's bedtime stories, the creak of floorboards as someone
uses the toilet at night. Privacy is minimal; family closeness is
enforced by architecture.*

The Spare Room (Sheldon's Room)

Size: Approximately 6 tatami mats; small but adequate

The door: Slides with a long, drawn-out creak 'like a small animal
protesting' --- Tenchi named it 'the squeaky door'

Window: Single window with paper screens (shoji); faces east; lets in
morning light

Futon: Against one wall; thin cotton batting; 'older than Tenchi';
smells of cedar from storage

Furniture: Low wooden chest in corner (for Sheldon's few possessions)

Tokonoma: Alcove with scroll painting --- brush-painted mountains
emerging from mist

Lighting: Late afternoon light through shoji screens; soft gold cast

Atmosphere: 'A room that had been empty and was now occupied. A space
making room for him.'

Previous Occupant: Nobuyuki Masaki

Who: Tenchi's father, Nobuyuki Masaki --- grew up at the shrine

When he left: When he married Kiyone Masaki (\~1982-83); moved to city
for work

Room status: Empty since then (\~6-7 years); used for storage; futon
kept in closet

What Katsuhito might say: 'This was Nobuyuki's room when he was young.'
(If asked)

Story potential: Connects Sheldon to Tenchi's father; 'you're sleeping
where Dad grew up'

Items left behind: The scroll painting (Nobuyuki's; left when he moved);
wooden chest (family piece)

*📝 Nobuyuki visits weekends. May notice his old room is occupied.
Creates natural tension/acceptance arc.*

The Ofuro (Traditional Bath)

Location: End of hallway, last door on left

Tub: Deep wooden tub; traditional construction; holds very hot water

Protocol: Wash OUTSIDE tub first (wooden bucket, soap, spigot); rinse
thoroughly; THEN soak

Mirror: Small mirror over washing area; where Sheldon sees his new face
again

Soap: Bar soap in dish by spigot; simple, unscented

Water: 'Hot enough to demand attention, forcing body to respond';
muscles unknot in the heat

Sheldon's experience: First proper wash; water runs gray from road dust
and sweat; profound relief

Day 1 Evening --- Dinner Details

Time: Approximately 6:00 PM (established household routine)

Location: Main room at low table

Menu: Rice (perfectly cooked, each grain distinct), miso soup (tofu and
wakame, rich with dashi), grilled salmon (butterflied, skin crisped,
flesh pink and tender), pickled vegetables

Character: Simple but well-prepared; 'the quiet competence of someone
cooking the same meals for decades'

Sheldon's consumption: Three bowls of rice; genuinely hungry; first food
in this body

Katsuhito's response: Says nothing about quantity; keeps rice coming
until Sheldon stops

Tenchi's observation: 'You use chopsticks good' --- corrected to 'well'
by Katsuhito

Evening Routine (Day 1)

After dinner: Dishes washed and put away; Tenchi helps carry bowls

Tenchi's bedtime: \~8:00 PM; story read by Katsuhito; audible through
thin walls

Tea: Green tea, slightly bitter, good quality but daily-use; served
after Tenchi in bed

Conversation: Katsuhito offers to show Sheldon the Tsukino house
tomorrow; no pressure, just facts

Sheldon to bed: \~8:30-9:00 PM; exhausted; sleeps 'deep and dreamless
and absolute'

Borrowed Clothes

Source: Katsuhito; left outside bathroom door

Items: Dark blue yukata (cotton, well-worn, clean); loose pants

Fit: Slightly short on Sheldon --- sleeves end few inches above wrists
--- but adequate

Sheldon's own clothes: Shirt stiff with dried sweat, trousers dusty;
gathered in bundle; need washing
