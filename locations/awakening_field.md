## Sensory Details

### Smell
- Green grass (chlorophyll, growing things)

- Soft yielding soil underfoot
- Spring breeze (light, from northwest)
- Sun warmth on exposed skin

### Sight
- Deep blue sky (spring clarity)
- White clouds (scattered, non-threatening)

## Flora & Fauna

### Grass
- Ankle-high, cool and slightly damp
- Individual blades distinct under fingers
- Wild and uncut — speaks to fallow status
- Swaying slightly in light breeze

### Purple Wildflowers: Sumire (菫)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | Japanese Violet (Viola mandshurica and related) |
| **Appearance** | Small (2-3 cm), five-petaled, purple to lavender |
| **Leaves** | Heart-shaped |
| **Blooming** | March to May (perfect for April 3) |
| **Growth** | Low to ground; clustered patches |
| **Scent** | Faint, sweet fragrance (detectable close to ground) |
| **Cultural Meaning** | Faithfulness, modesty, sincerity |

**Sheldon's Perception:** Doesn't know the species; sees only "small purple flowers, delicate, unfamiliar"

*📝 These flowers don't grow in Georgia or California. Another sign Sheldon is somewhere entirely new.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: Sumire's meaning — faithfulness — quietly echoes the story's themes. Cosmos chose this field. Even the flowers mean something.*

### Treeline (North)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Composition** | Japanese cedar (sugi) mixed with deciduous species |
| **Character** | "Settled quality, an ancientness" |
| **Height** | Not tall by American standards |
| **Impression** | Deeply rooted, permanent |
| **Comparison** | Nothing like California redwoods or Pacific Northwest old-growth; different kind of permanence |

### The Three-Note Bird: Uguisu (鶯)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Species** | Japanese Bush Warbler (Horornis diphone) |
| **Call Pattern** | "Hō-hoke-kyo" (ホーホケキョ) |
| **Why "Three Notes"** | Sheldon, unfamiliar, perceives as three questioning notes |
| **Cultural Significance** | THE iconic spring bird of Japan |
| **Appearance** | Small (14cm), olive-brown, pale eyebrows |
| **Behavior** | Secretive; more often heard than seen |
| **Habitat** | Bamboo thickets, forest edges, dense shrubs |

**Sheldon's Perception:** Just an unfamiliar call — "beautiful, questioning, marking time"

*📝 Later, Sheldon learns its name and cultural weight — Japan's herald of spring.*

*🔮 FORESHADOW: The uguisu's call punctuates Sheldon's resurrection. Spring announcing itself. New life beginning.*

## Narrative Significance

### Why Cosmos Chose This Location

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Proximity** | Close enough to reach shrine by public transit |
| **Distance** | Far enough to require a journey (not placed directly in destination) |
| **Symbolism** | Open field = blank slate; must walk toward new life |
| **Privacy** | Rural enough to avoid witnesses to awakening |
| **Accessibility** | Not stranded; road and transit reachable |
| **Season** | Spring timing emphasizes rebirth theme |

### The Journey as Narrative

Cosmos could have placed Sheldon at the shrine's doorstep. She didn't.

The walk to the road, the ride with Yamamoto, the bus to the shrine base, the climb of 320 steps — each stage is intentional. Sheldon must *choose* to move toward his new life with each step. The journey itself is part of the healing.

### Recurring Motifs

| Motif | First Appearance | Later Appearances |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| Uguisu call | Scene 1 (awakening) | Scene 6 (shrine), Scene 9 (morning), ongoing |
| Warmth in chest | Scene 1 (first sensation) | Throughout Phase I (Cosmos connection) |
| Spring/rebirth | Field in bloom | Anniversary scenes, seasonal markers |

---

## Story Application

### Scene Usage

| Scene | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Scene 1.1** | Awakening — full sensory immersion, disorientation to grounding |
| **Scene 1.2** | Walking to road — body awareness, processing, first choices |
| **Flashbacks** | May return in memory during significant moments |
| **Anniversary** | Potential return visit in later years |

### Uguisu Continuity

- **Scene 1:** Bird calls as Sheldon wakes — "three notes, high and questioning"
- **Scene 6:** Heard again at shrine — continuity of sound, arriving home
- **Scene 9:** Morning at shrine — the call now familiar, comforting
- **Future:** Learns it's called uguisu; understands the poetry of his arrival
