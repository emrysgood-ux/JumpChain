## SCENE 1.2: THE ASCENT

**April 3, 1989 — 15:30 JST**
**Location:** Masaki Shrine steps
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

The steps counted themselves as I climbed.

Not consciously—I wasn't running a tally in my head, watching numbers increment like a fitness tracker. But some part of my mind noted each stone as I passed it, cataloging the way they varied in height and depth, the patterns of wear that told stories about centuries of feet choosing the same paths.

Twenty steps in, and the torii gate was behind me. The forest closed in on both sides, cedar branches reaching across the gap like they were trying to hold hands overhead. The light came through in patches, dappling the stone with gold and green.

Forty steps. The path curved slightly, following the contour of the mountain. I could hear water somewhere below—a stream, maybe, running through a gully I couldn't see. The sound was constant, a bass note under the birdsong that still continued its three-note pattern.

I kept climbing.

My body continued to behave strangely. By sixty steps, I should have been feeling something—the familiar burn in my thighs, the tightness in my chest that came from asking lungs to process more oxygen than usual. Instead there was only the rhythm of movement, step following step with mechanical precision.

At eighty steps, I stopped to test it.

I stood on the worn stone and waited for my breathing to catch up with my exertion. It didn't need to. My breath came as easily as if I'd been standing still. My heart rate was elevated—I could feel that, the slightly faster pulse in my wrists—but not by much. Not by as much as it should have been.

I started climbing again.

The forest thinned slightly around the hundredth step, allowing glimpses of sky through the canopy. Stone lanterns appeared on either side of the path, their surfaces mottled with lichen that suggested decades of weathering. One of them had a crack running down its side, carefully repaired with some kind of adhesive that had discolored over time.

Someone took care of this place. Someone had been taking care of it for a very long time.

The steps continued. 

At a hundred and fifty, the incline steepened briefly, and I found a rhythm that accommodated the change—shorter steps, slightly more forward lean, weight distributed carefully across each foot. My body knew how to do this. Had always known, maybe, or had learned so thoroughly that the knowledge lived in muscle rather than memory.

By two hundred steps, I'd stopped expecting the fatigue to hit. It wasn't coming. Whatever had happened to me—whatever had put me in that field with a new name and reset body—had also given me endurance that didn't match anything I remembered possessing. 

I thought about marathons. I'd never run one, never wanted to. But I'd known people who did, watched them train, listened to them talk about the wall that hit at mile twenty when glycogen stores depleted and willpower became the only fuel left. This climb wasn't a marathon, but it was work—real, physical work—and my body was doing it without complaint.

Not supernatural. I wasn't flying or moving at impossible speeds or doing anything that violated the laws of physics I'd spent my career studying. Just... capable. More capable than I had any right to be.

The two hundred and fiftieth step brought the first clear view of the shrine grounds.

Through a gap in the trees, I could see buildings—traditional construction, wood and tile, the kind of architecture that looked like it had grown from the mountain rather than being built on it. A main hall, smaller structures clustered around it, paths of raked gravel connecting everything in patterns that suggested both functionality and ritual.

And the tree.

The tree stood at the center of everything, and it was... wrong.

Not wrong like damaged or dying. Wrong like a word you've been using your whole life suddenly sounds foreign. The tree was ancient—that much was obvious from the girth of its trunk, the way its canopy spread across the shrine grounds like a green umbrella. But there was something else about it, something that made my eyes want to slide away and focus on anything else.

I forced myself to look.

The bark was gray-brown, deeply furrowed, the kind of texture that accumulated over centuries. The branches reached outward and upward in patterns that should have been random but somehow weren't. And there was a presence to it, a sense of... weight? Attention? Like the tree was watching back.

I shook my head and kept climbing.

Two hundred and eighty. Two hundred and ninety. The last stretch was steeper than the rest, the steps narrower, forcing me to pay attention to my footing. I could see the final landing above me now—flat stone, swept clean, marking the transition from approach to arrival.

Three hundred.

Ten more steps. The shrine grounds opened before me, framed by the last of the forest. I could see details now—the way the gravel paths were edged with carefully placed stones, the small structures that served purposes I couldn't guess at, the quiet emptiness that suggested either abandonment or the special stillness of sacred spaces between ceremonies.

Three hundred and ten.

The tree dominated everything. Even when I wasn't looking directly at it, I was aware of its presence—the way it anchored the space, the way everything else seemed to orient around it. The feeling of being watched had intensified as I climbed, and I realized it wasn't my imagination. Something about this place was paying attention.

Three hundred and fifteen.

Three hundred and sixteen. Three hundred and seventeen.

Three hundred and eighteen.

Three hundred and nineteen.

Three hundred and twenty.

I stepped onto the landing and stood at the top of the shrine approach.

The late afternoon light came in at a slant, gilding the tile roofs with gold. Shadows stretched long across the gravel paths. The tree's branches moved slightly in a breeze I couldn't feel, leaves rustling with a sound like whispered conversation.

I had climbed three hundred and twenty steps without breaking stride. My legs felt fine. My lungs felt fine. My heart was beating normally, unhurried, unconcerned.

The tree watched me. I didn't know how I knew that, but I knew it the way I knew the sun was behind me—as a fact too obvious to question.

I was standing at Masaki Shrine, and something here was aware that I'd arrived.
