## SCENE 1.1: THE AWAKENING

**April 3, 1989 — 14:47:23 JST**
**Location:** Chrysanthemum field near Shiroato ruins, Okayama Prefecture
**POV:** Sheldon Tsukino

---

The first thing was grass.

Not the sensation of it—that came second, the cool pressure of individual blades against his left cheek, the slight dampness where morning dew had not yet burned away. The first thing was the smell. Green and alive and impossibly clean, filling his nostrils with each shallow breath, carrying undertones of turned earth and something floral he couldn't immediately place. The scent triggered a cascade of association: summer lawns, childhood afternoons, his grandmother's backyard in Jackson where the grass grew thick enough to lose marbles in.

He did not move.

His body lay pressed into soil that gave slightly beneath his weight, and his mind floated somewhere above it, not yet ready to engage with the question of why he was lying face-down in grass when he should not be lying anywhere at all. The disconnect between sensation and comprehension created a buffer zone, a momentary reprieve during which he could simply exist without having to process what existence currently meant.

The last thing he remembered was the laboratory.

The memory surfaced with reluctance, like something heavy being dragged up from deep water. The containment field had been fluctuating for three hours. Dr. Morrison—nervous, always nervous, his hands never quite still when the readings danced near acceptable thresholds—had suggested shutting down twice, and twice Sheldon had talked him back from the edge. They were close. The funding committee needed results before the quarterly review. The experimental drive core sat in its housing like a star that had been talked into behaving, dense with potential energy, humming at frequencies that made Sheldon's back teeth ache.

Then the magnetic coils had failed.

Not gradually. Not with the warning signs that theory predicted and training prepared you for. One moment the readings were elevated but manageable, oscillating in patterns Sheldon had learned to read the way sailors read waves. The next moment every alarm in the facility was screaming, and the light inside the containment unit was shifting from controlled blue to something wilder, whiter, hungrier—the color of a star remembering what it was supposed to be.

He remembered turning toward the viewport. He remembered Maria Chen's face through the glass, her hand frozen halfway to the emergency cutoff, her mouth open in a scream he couldn't hear over the alarms. He remembered the sensation of heat against his skin, far too much heat far too fast, the air itself becoming hostile.

He remembered knowing.

The numbers had been in his head—they were always in his head, the curse and gift of a mind that couldn't stop calculating—and the numbers said there was no surviving what was about to happen. The energy release would vaporize everything within fifty meters. The cascade had already begun. There was no stopping it, no outrunning it, no clever last-second solution that would let him walk away with a story for conferences. There was only the light, growing brighter, and a strange calm settling over him like a blanket.

He'd had time to think *oh*.

Not fear. Recognition. The quiet acknowledgment of a fact that could not be argued with. He was dying, and there was nothing to be done about it, and the part of his brain that had spent thirty-eight years solving problems had finally encountered one it couldn't solve.

The light had taken him.

---

And then—

Something else.

The memory was harder to hold, slippery in ways the laboratory memories weren't. Between the light and the grass, between the dying and the lying here, there had been... something. Not darkness, because darkness implied space for light to be absent from. Not silence, because silence implied the possibility of sound. Something outside the categories his mind wanted to sort experience into.

Warmth.

That was the closest word, though it captured almost nothing of what he half-remembered. Not the warmth of the containment failure, which had been violent and consuming and very specifically about temperature. This was different. Gentle. Encompassing. Like being wrapped in something soft that didn't register as heat but registered as *safe*—the way his grandmother's arms had registered as safe when he was small enough to fit entirely inside her embrace.

There had been something else in that warmth. A presence. Vast and patient and achingly kind, gathering the scattered fragments of his existence with the tenderness of someone collecting shattered glass, careful not to lose a single piece. He couldn't see it—couldn't see anything, existing in a state that didn't include vision as a category—but he could feel it the way you felt someone watching you from across a room. Attention that was not intrusive. Concern that was not conditional.

And there had been... not sound, exactly. A resonance. A chime-like frequency that vibrated through whatever remained of him, carrying meaning that bypassed language entirely. A frequency that said, without saying: *you are seen. You are held. You are not alone.*

Something like wings. He remembered something like wings—vast and soft, made of light that didn't burn, wrapping around him with infinite gentleness. And a message, not in words but in impression, settling into whatever served as his consciousness:

*Live well. I will find you when I can.*

Then the warmth had released him, gently, into—

Grass. And the smell of growing things. And a body that was lying face-down in a field in a place that was emphatically not Alaska.

---

Sheldon opened his eyes.

The world resolved itself in layers: green first, the close-up geometry of individual grass blades rising from dark soil. Then blue, a strip of sky visible at the edge of his vision, saturated and warm in a way that Alaska's sky never was. Then white, dozens of small white flowers growing among the grass, their petals catching the afternoon light.

He lay still for another moment, cataloging sensations. Heart beating—that seemed significant. Lungs working—significant too. The dead, as a general rule, did not have heartbeats or working lungs. These facts suggested a conclusion that his rational mind kept sliding away from, unwilling to commit to an assertion so thoroughly outside the boundaries of established physics.

He moved his fingers first. An experimental flex, testing whether his body still answered to commands. His right hand was resting palm-down in the grass beside his head, and his fingers curled and uncurled smoothly, each joint articulating without resistance or complaint. No pain. No stiffness. No indication that anything was wrong.

He moved his other hand. Same result. Then his toes, inside shoes he didn't remember putting on. Then his arms, pressing against the ground, beginning the slow process of pushing himself upward.

The motion was too easy.

Sheldon had lived in his body for thirty-eight years. He knew its rhythms, its responses, the particular way his muscles engaged when he pushed himself up from the ground. He kept himself in condition—always had, his grandmother's voice in his head reminding him that a man who couldn't take care of his own body couldn't be trusted to take care of anything else. Getting up wasn't difficult for him. It was just *familiar*. The specific recruitment pattern of core and arms, the shift of weight, the momentary tension before momentum took over.

This wasn't familiar.

His body simply rose, flowing from prone to sitting to standing with a fluidity that felt *new*. Not better than before—his old body had worked fine—but different. Smoother. Like the difference between a well-maintained car and one fresh off the assembly line. Both functional, but one had never been driven.

He stood in the field and looked at his hands.

They were his hands. He knew them the way he knew his own face in the mirror: the short fingers, the broad palms, the particular shade of brown that darkened across his knuckles and lightened in the creases of his joints. He had spent three decades watching these hands hold tools and write equations, calibrate instruments and cook his grandmother's recipes. These were absolutely, unmistakably his hands.

But they were wrong.

He turned his right hand over, examining the palm. The skin was smooth and unmarked, the lines of fate and life etched cleanly into flesh that looked like it had never been used. No calluses from years of gripping equipment. No small scars from the accumulated minor accidents of laboratory work.

The pad of his right thumb was smooth.

He stared at it. The thin white scar should have been there—the one from the apple incident when he was eight. He'd been helping his grandmother make a pie, showing off how well he could peel without looking, and the paring knife had slipped. Blood everywhere. Crying. His grandmother pressing a dish towel tight against the cut while she walked him to the bathroom, her voice calm and practical even as the white cloth turned red. *It's all right, baby. Cuts bleed a lot but they heal fast. You're going to be fine.*

The scar had been there for thirty years. A thin white line across the pad, barely visible but always present, a permanent reminder of the day he'd learned that showing off had consequences.

Gone.

He pushed up his sleeves and checked his forearms. The burn mark from the soldering accident in Kyoto, the one that had left a patch of shiny skin the size of a quarter. Gone. The weird discoloration on his right wrist that he'd stopped bothering to ask doctors about. Gone.

His body was the same shape—short, stocky, familiar, five foot four and built like his grandfather had been built, compact and dense, what his grandmother had called *sturdy* and his college roommate had called *hobbit-like*. But it had been... reset. Cleaned. Like someone had taken the original blueprints and manufactured a fresh copy, keeping the essential architecture while removing all evidence of use.

He was standing in a body that felt like his but wasn't quite.

---

Something pressed against his left wrist.

He'd felt it since waking—a slight weight, a band of pressure—but his mind had been occupied with larger impossibilities. Now he looked down.

A watch.

Silver-toned case, maybe thirty millimeters across. White face with black hands and small black numerals at the hours. The second hand swept smoothly around the dial, not ticking in discrete jumps but gliding in the continuous motion of a mechanical movement. A brown leather strap, worn soft with apparent use, buckled comfortably around his wrist.

2:47 PM.

Sheldon stared at it.

He hadn't been wearing a watch when he died. His old Casio digital had died three years ago—he'd been meaning to replace it but never got around to it, his phone serving well enough for timekeeping. And this wasn't the kind of watch he would have bought anyway. Too elegant. Too traditional. The kind of thing his grandfather might have worn, the kind of thing that required daily winding and attention rather than batteries and benign neglect.

Someone had buckled this to his wrist.

The realization arrived with a strange weight. While he was unconscious—while he was *dead*, or whatever state preceded waking up in this field—someone had taken this watch and wrapped the leather strap around his wrist and pushed the buckle pin through the hole and secured it there. An intimate act. The kind of thing you did for a child who couldn't dress themselves, or for a patient who couldn't manage fine motor tasks.

The kind of thing you did for someone you were taking care of.

He touched the crystal with his fingertip. Solid. Real. Warm from the sun and from his own body heat.

---

The white flowers surrounded him.

He noticed them properly now, looking beyond the immediate circle of disturbed grass where he'd been lying. They grew everywhere—dozens, hundreds, carpeting the field in clusters that caught the afternoon light. Small blooms, each with layers of delicate petals arranged in circular patterns, their centers yellow against the white.

Chrysanthemums. The word surfaced from somewhere in his memory. White chrysanthemums.

He didn't know why the identification felt significant. They were just flowers. Pretty, in an understated way, but just flowers. His grandmother had grown them in her garden, he remembered suddenly. Had complained about the deer eating them. Had cut them for arrangements on the dining room table, white against the dark wood, formal and somehow solemn.

The field stretched around him in a gentle slope, chrysanthemums and grass giving way to rice paddies below and forested hills above. In the distance—maybe a hundred meters uphill—he could see the remnants of old stone foundations, overgrown with vegetation but still visibly artificial. The ruins of something. A castle, maybe, or a large estate. The kind of structure that accumulated in the Japanese countryside over centuries, built and abandoned and slowly reclaimed by the land.

The sight tugged at something in his mind, but he couldn't articulate what.

---

He patted his pockets.

The action was automatic, the instinctive check for wallet and keys that urban life had trained into him. His hands found fabric—dark slacks, the kind he would have worn to work, professional but not formal—and within the fabric, objects. Something soft in his right front pocket. The clink of metal in his left. A familiar weight in his back right.

He started with the right front pocket. His fingers touched fabric within fabric—cloth, folded with geometric precision. He pulled it out.

A handkerchief.

White cotton. High thread count, the kind that felt substantial between his fingers. Folded into a neat square with sharp creases, each edge aligned perfectly with the others. The kind of handkerchief his grandmother had ironed every Sunday evening, standing at the board in her kitchen while the radio played gospel and the smell of Sunday dinner lingered in the air.

*A man should always carry a handkerchief, baby. You never know when you'll need to wipe your face or help a lady with her tears or clean up a mess you've made.*

He'd carried one through high school. Through college. Through his first two doctoral programs. Somewhere during the third—Caltech, the quantum mechanics years, when he'd been so deep in equations that he sometimes forgot to eat—he'd stopped. Too much trouble. Too old-fashioned. One more piece of the Jackson boy he'd been trying to leave behind in the pursuit of becoming a theoretical physicist.

Now here was a handkerchief in his pocket, white and pressed and folded exactly the way his grandmother had taught him.

As if someone knew. As if someone remembered.

He refolded it carefully, matching the creases, and slipped it back into his pocket.

The left pocket yielded coins. A handful of yen—he recognized the shapes even before pulling them out—in various denominations. One-hundred yen pieces, fifty-yen coins with holes in the center, smaller tens and fives. Pocket change. The kind of money you'd carry for vending machines and small purchases, unremarkable and useful.

The back pocket held the wallet.

He pulled it out and held it in his hands. Brown leather, bi-fold, the kind that fit Japanese yen notes without folding them. Worn at the edges in a pattern that suggested years of daily use, softened from apparent handling. Not his wallet—his wallet had been black synthetic, bought at a Target in Berkeley because the old one had finally fallen apart. This was something else. Something given.

He opened it.

---

Money first. His eyes went there automatically, the learned reflex of a man who had grown up watching his grandmother count bills at the kitchen table, who had learned early that money was survival and you always knew exactly how much you had.

Bills, neatly arranged. He pulled them out and counted.

Yen. Japanese yen. Ten-thousand-yen notes—five of them—crisp but not new, the kind of bills that had circulated for a while, that wouldn't draw attention when spent. Behind them, smaller denominations: five-thousands and thousands for daily use.

Fifty thousand yen in large bills, plus perhaps another fifteen thousand in smaller notes. Someone had thought about this. Someone had understood that you couldn't walk into a rural shop with a ten-thousand-yen note and expect not to draw stares.

He didn't know exactly what that meant in dollar terms, but it was substantial. Enough to survive on for weeks if he was careful.

*Someone is taking care of me.*

The thought arrived with the same strange weight as the watch. Practical care. Thoughtful provision. The actions of someone who understood what a person needed to exist in the world and had arranged for those needs to be met.

He looked at the card slots.

An identification card sat in the front slot, positioned to be visible through a small plastic window. He slid it out and examined it.

The format was immediately recognizable: an Alien Registration Certificate, the document all foreign residents in Japan were required to carry. He'd had one during his postdoc years in Kyoto, had renewed it annually, had learned to keep it on his person at all times because the police could—and occasionally did—stop foreigners to check documentation.

This card had his face on it. His face, but younger—thirty, maybe, matching whatever age his body had been reset to—in a small color photograph against a white background. The same features he'd seen in mirrors for decades, but without the lines around the eyes, without the gray at his temples, without the particular weathering that thirty-eight years of living had accumulated.

The text was in Japanese, but he read it without conscious effort, the meaning arriving simultaneously with the visual recognition of the characters:

**Name:** 月野 シェルドン (Tsukino Sheldon)  
**Nationality:** アメリカ合衆国 (United States of America)  
**Date of Birth:** 1959年3月15日 (March 15, 1959)  
**Status of Residence:** 永住者 (Permanent Resident)  
**Date of Registration:** 1987年4月 (April 1987)

He read the birth date twice. Three times. The numbers refused to rearrange themselves into something that made sense.

March 15, 1959.

He'd been born August 21, 1987. He'd died October 23, 2025, at thirty-eight years old.

This document said he was thirty.

Someone had made him younger. Eight years younger than he'd been when he died. The body he was standing in wasn't just reset—it was *revised*, aged backward to a point he barely remembered, to the version of himself that had existed before the accumulated wear of late thirties had begun to settle into his joints and his metabolism and his face.

He looked at his hands again. At his forearms. At the smooth skin where scars should have been. The absence of evidence wasn't just about healing—it was about time. He was inhabiting a body that had never lived through the years that would have created those marks.

Thirty years old. In a body that matched the documentation perfectly.

He slid the registration card back into its slot and kept looking.

---

Behind the cash, pressed into a pocket clearly designed for them: bankbooks. Two of them, their covers worn, one from a regional bank he didn't recognize and one from Japan Post. He opened the first and scanned the transaction records—deposits, withdrawals, a balance that made no sense for someone who had spent most of his career on postdoc stipends. Five hundred thousand yen. The postal savings book showed another two hundred ninety-seven thousand.

Nearly eight hundred thousand yen in accessible funds. Years of modest salary, saved and waiting for him.

Someone had built him a financial history.

Behind the bankbooks, more documents. He pulled them out one at a time, unfolding them carefully, reading each with the methodical attention of someone cataloging evidence.

A *koseki tohon*—an excerpt from the family register. Official stamps, formal language, the genealogical documentation that Japanese bureaucracy required for everything from marriage to property transfer. It traced his connection to the Tsukino family of Okayama Prefecture, establishing him as the son of Tsukino Yuki and an American father named James Carter. There were other names too—grandparents, aunts, uncles—a web of family relations he had never lived but that apparently existed in whatever records someone had created.

And at the bottom of the stack, folded small but handled often enough to wear soft at the edges: a photograph.

He unfolded it carefully.

An elderly Japanese man stood in front of a traditional wooden house, the architecture immediately recognizable as rural and historical. Behind him, the house rose in weathered elegance—dark wood, paper screens, the heavy tile roof of a building that had stood for generations. The man was small and slight, his face mapped with wrinkles, his posture slightly bent but his eyes sharp even in the photograph.

Sheldon had never seen him before. But the photograph had been carried. Had been looked at. Had been touched by fingers that cared about the face it showed.

This was someone's family. This was *his* family, according to every document in this wallet. A fabricated history that felt more real than fabrication should feel, complete with financial records and official stamps and a photograph worn soft from handling.

---

The envelope was heavier than he'd expected.

He'd been treating it as another document—another piece of the carefully constructed paperwork that filled this wallet—but when he pulled it from the inner pocket, he felt the weight of multiple pages. The address on the front was written in careful Japanese characters, addressed to "Tsukino Sheldon" at what appeared to be a California address. A forwarding label covered part of it, redirecting to somewhere else—a property management company, from the look of the corporate stamp.

The flap was unsealed. Someone had opened this, read it, and tucked it back into the envelope. Someone who was supposed to be him.

He pulled out the contents. Two sheets. The first was a full page of handwritten Japanese, dated February 18, 1989—six weeks ago, if the system's date was accurate. The second was shorter, more formal, with a red seal stamped at the bottom.

He read the longer letter first.

---

*Dear Sheldon,*

*I received your letter last week and read it three times. Haruko cried. She has been worried about you since Yuki passed, and to hear that you are finally coming home—yes, I will call it home, because it is—has lifted a weight from both of us.*

The words swam for a moment before settling into meaning. *Uncle Kiyoshi.* The name from the return address, the name from the family register. His mother's brother. A man who apparently existed, who apparently cared, who had apparently been corresponding with "Sheldon" for years.

*Four years. I know they have not been easy years. First your mother, then Michiko-obasan, then all the paperwork that follows death like crows follow a harvest. You wrote that settling the California estate took longer than you expected. I am not surprised. Your mother kept everything, and she owned more than you knew. The house, the investments, the storage unit you mentioned—Yuki was always preparing for difficulties that might never come. She learned that from our mother, who learned it from the war.*

Sheldon's throat tightened.

The cadence was wrong—this wasn't his grandmother, wasn't Dorothy Mae with her Georgia drawl and her practical wisdom—but the sentiment was the same. A mother who prepared for difficulties. Who kept everything. Who learned caution from hardship and passed it down through generations.

*I am glad you decided to rent the California house rather than sell it. Property is security. Your mother would approve.*

He had property in California. Rental property. Income, presumably, flowing into accounts he'd never opened from tenants he'd never met. The constructed life grew more elaborate with every line.

*You asked about the Tsukino house. I visited last autumn with Masaru to check on things. The roof needs work—there is a leak in the northeast corner that has damaged the ceiling of the back room. The kitchen is old but functional. Michiko-obasan kept the place clean until her illness, but eleven years empty is eleven years empty. You will need to hire workers for the roof. I can recommend a man in Kamogata if you need a name—Yamamoto Toshiro, he did work for the shrine years ago and is honest.*

Practical information. Names. A roofer called Yamamoto. A shrine. Kamogata—that must be the village. The letter was providing exactly what he would need to navigate a place he'd never been, to fix a house he'd never seen, to exist as a person he'd never been.

*The shop building is still sound. Michiko-obasan's husband ran the grocery there until he died, and she kept the structure maintained even after she closed it. You mentioned in your letter that you have ideas for the space. I look forward to hearing them.*

Ideas for the space. Apparently he—the other Sheldon, the constructed one—had plans. Had written about them. Had shared ambitions with an uncle who cared enough to ask.

*The village remembers the Tsukino family. When I visited, old Haruna-san at the grocery asked after you. She remembers when you came for Michiko-obasan's funeral. "The American nephew," she called you. "Polite. Quiet. Good Japanese." You made an impression. The village will welcome you back.*

He had been here before. In 1986, apparently, for a funeral he didn't attend, making impressions on people he'd never met. The constructed history included not just documents but *memories*—other people's memories of a Sheldon who had walked these roads, spoken these words, existed in this place.

*About your plans: I understand the need for rest. You worked yourself nearly to death at that laboratory—I could hear it in your letters, even when you did not say it directly. Bell Laboratories is prestigious, yes, but prestige does not heal grief. A year to breathe, to repair the house, to decide what comes next—this is wise. You are thirty years old. You have time.*

Bell Laboratories.

The name landed with the weight of recognition. He had known people who worked there—had applied, once, during his second doctorate, before deciding academia suited him better. Bell Labs was where theoretical physicists went when they wanted industry money without sacrificing research freedom. It was exactly where someone with his background might end up.

Someone had done their homework. Someone had built him a career that made sense, that fit his actual skills and interests, that a person with four PhDs in physics-adjacent fields might genuinely have pursued.

*Haruko wants me to tell you that you must eat properly. She does not trust you to cook for yourself. I have told her that you learned from Yuki, who learned from our mother, and that you will not starve. She is not convinced. Expect care packages.*

Despite everything—despite the impossibility of his situation, despite the growing weight of a fabricated life settling onto his shoulders—Sheldon almost smiled. The aunt who worried about food. The uncle who reassured her. The threat of care packages delivered with love and concern.

It sounded like family. It sounded *real*.

*When you are settled—truly settled, not just arrived—we will visit. Obon would be appropriate. Haruko wants to pay respects at the family grave, and I want to see what you do with the old place. Fumiko has also asked to come. She was too young to remember you well from your visit in 1980, but she has read Yuki's letters and feels she knows you. Her children ask about their American cousin. You have family here, Sheldon. Do not forget that.*

Obon. August. The festival of the dead, when families gathered and ancestors were honored.

Four months. He had four months before people who loved "Sheldon" arrived expecting to recognize him. Four months to learn a life he hadn't lived, to become a person he'd never been, to figure out how to look into the eyes of an elderly man and pretend he remembered being held as a child.

*I know you have had interest from NTT. You mentioned it in your December letter. They would be lucky to have you—your work speaks for itself, and Japanese companies value loyalty and dedication. But do not rush. The patents you filed will keep. The ideas you have for your own company will keep. Rest first. Grieve properly. Your mother deserves that, and so do you.*

NTT. Patents. A tech company of his own. The constructed Sheldon had ambitions, had plans, had a future mapped out beyond the immediate crisis of arriving in a strange place with a strange life.

Someone had thought about this. Someone had built not just a past but a *future*—a trajectory that would explain his presence, his activities, his goals for years to come.

*The enclosed letter is for the village. If anyone asks who you are or why you have come, show them this. It explains that you are Yuki's son, Kiyoshi's nephew, the rightful heir to the Tsukino property. In the countryside, family connections matter. This letter is your introduction.*

He looked at the second sheet. Shorter, more formal. A letter of introduction, complete with a red seal at the bottom—Kiyoshi's personal *hanko*, his official stamp, lending the weight of his identity to the recommendation.

*To Whom It May Concern:*

*The bearer of this letter is Tsukino Sheldon, son of my late sister Tsukino Yuki and her husband James Carter of America...*

He skimmed the rest. The formal language, the careful phrasing, the request for kindness extended to a family member. It was exactly what he would need if he walked into a rural Japanese village as a Black American stranger—proof of connection, of belonging, of having a right to be there.

Someone had thought of everything.

*Write when you arrive. Call if there is a telephone—I do not know if Michiko-obasan had one installed. If not, the shrine has a phone. The priest there, Masaki-san, knew Michiko-obasan. He will help you if you need anything.*

Masaki.

The name snagged on something in his mind. The ruins uphill—were they connected to a shrine? The priest, Masaki. A phone he could use. Help if he needed it.

*Travel safely. Eat properly. Rest.*

*Your uncle,*
*Kiyoshi*

*P.S. — Haruko has already started planning what to cook when we visit. You have been warned.*

---

Sheldon sat in the chrysanthemums, holding the letters in hands that had begun to tremble.

This was too much. Too detailed. Too *caring*. Forged documents were one thing—he could understand forged documents, could process them as tools, as props in whatever elaborate scenario he'd been dropped into. But this letter wasn't a tool. This letter was a man pouring love onto paper for a nephew he'd watched grow up, a nephew he'd worried about through years of grief and overwork, a nephew he was looking forward to seeing again.

The love was real. Kiyoshi's love was *real*, even if the memories that generated it had been manufactured from nothing.

*What kind of power does that?* he thought. *What kind of being creates not just documents but relationships? Not just a cover story but a family that genuinely cares?*

He thought of his grandmother. Of Dorothy Mae Carter, who had raised him after his parents proved unequal to the task, who had taught him everything that mattered about being a person in the world. She was gone now—not dead in this timeline, but *gone*, existing in a universe he could no longer reach, loving a version of him that had died in a laboratory in Alaska.

But here was another family. A different family, manufactured by whatever force had rebuilt him and placed him here. An uncle who worried about him eating properly. An aunt planning meals for a visit. A cousin who wanted to meet him. Children who asked about their American cousin.

It wasn't the same. It could never be the same.

But it was something.

He folded the letters carefully, matching the original creases, and slid them back into the envelope. Then he tucked the envelope into the wallet, into the pocket designed to hold it, and put the wallet back where it belonged.

He had a cover story now. A complete one. If anyone asked why he was here, he could explain: the death of his mother, the inheritance from his aunt, the years of paperwork, the sabbatical from Bell Labs, the plan to rest and rebuild before deciding what came next. Every piece of it made sense. Every piece of it fit together into a life that someone could actually have lived.

The only problem was that he hadn't lived it.

And in four months, people who thought he had would arrive expecting him to remember.

---

The final document was a property deed, folded into thirds, formal Japanese covering every surface. It described a building and associated land in Okayama Prefecture, registered to Tsukino Sheldon, transferred from the previous owner—Tsukino Michiko, deceased—on a date that used an era-year format he had to calculate.

He had property. In Japan. In a prefecture he had never lived in, under a name that was his but wasn't his.

---

Something flickered at the edge of his awareness.

Not visual. Not auditory. More like a pressure behind his eyes, a sense of information trying to arrive through channels that weren't quite designed for it. Sheldon focused on the sensation instinctively, giving it his attention the way he would give attention to an anomalous reading on an instrument—not forcing interpretation, just observing, letting the data resolve itself.

The pressure shifted, and knowledge arrived.

Not words, exactly. The information didn't come in sentences that he could hear or see. It simply became present in his mind, appearing with the quality of something remembered rather than something learned: *Physical form reconstructed. Life, family background, and documentation established.*

Sheldon stood very still.

The words—if they could be called words—landed differently now. He'd just read the proof of that establishment. The letters, the bankbooks, the photograph, the koseki. The life that had been built for him, complete with family who loved him and colleagues who respected him and a future that made sense.

*Life, family background, and documentation established.*

Yes. He'd noticed.

"Hello?" he said aloud. "Is someone there?"

No response. The presence—if that's what it was—had withdrawn, or perhaps it was simply waiting. He tried focusing on it again, trying to pull more information through whatever channel had briefly opened.

"What is this? Where am I? Who—"

*Current location: Okayama Prefecture, Japan.*

The knowledge arrived mid-question, cutting him off with its matter-of-factness. Then, after a pause that might have been deliberate:

*Current date: April 3, 1989.*

Sheldon's legs stopped working.

He didn't fall—his body simply refused the command to remain standing, folding beneath him with the graceless efficiency of a puppet whose strings had been cut. He sat down hard in the chrysanthemums, the impact jarring but not painful, and stared at nothing while his mind tried to process what he'd just learned.

1989.

He was in 1989.

---

The math ran itself, because the math always ran itself, because his mind couldn't encounter numbers without calculating their implications even when those implications were impossible.

1989. Thirty-six years before his death. A world where the Berlin Wall still stood, where the internet existed only in university basements, where the phone in his pocket would have been science fiction. A world that felt like history even though he'd lived through it once, as a child too young to remember.

But this wasn't his world. The realization settled into him with the weight of something too large to process all at once. Different universe. Different timeline. Whatever connection existed between here and the place he'd come from—if any connection existed at all—it wasn't the kind that would let him catch a flight to Georgia and knock on a familiar door.

His grandmother wasn't alive somewhere he couldn't reach. His grandmother was *gone*. The world where she had existed, where she had raised him, where she had taught him everything that mattered—that world was as distant as the stars. Maybe more distant. At least you could see stars.

All he had left of her was what she'd given him. The lessons. The voice in his head. The stubborn insistence that a person could survive anything if they remembered how to breathe.

His hands were shaking.

He noticed the tremor distantly, the way he might notice a data point in an experiment—with clinical interest that barely masked the chaos underneath. His palms pressed flat against his thighs, fingers digging into the fabric of his slacks, trying to ground himself through physical contact with something solid.

*When everything falls apart, baby, you breathe first.*

His grandmother's voice, rising unbidden from memory. The advice she'd given him when he was seven, crying over something he couldn't even remember now—a broken toy, a failed test, some childhood catastrophe that had seemed world-ending at the time. She'd held him in her kitchen, her apron smelling of cornbread and her hands warm on his back, and she'd told him the secret to surviving anything.

*Breathe first. Everything else can wait until you've got air in your lungs.*

Sheldon breathed.

In through the nose, slow and controlled, the way she'd taught him. Hold for a count of four. Out through the mouth, slower still, letting the exhale carry tension out of his muscles. Again. And again. And again, until the shaking subsided and his heart stopped racing and he could think about something other than the impossibility of his current situation.

He was in 1989. In Japan. In a body that had been "reconstructed" by something that communicated in fragmentary impressions and refused to explain itself. He had documentation for a life he'd never lived, property in a place he'd never been, and a family background that someone—something—had apparently created for him.

*Life, family background, and documentation established.*

He'd seen the proof. The letters. The love.

He wasn't alone in this world.

The realization didn't make anything easier to understand, but it changed the shape of his panic. He wasn't a stranger dropped into hostile territory with nothing but forged papers. He was... what? An amnesiac returning home? A distant relative appearing to claim inheritance? Something. Someone. A person with a place in the world, even if he didn't know what that place was or how he'd come to occupy it.

---

He tried the voice again.

"Can you tell me more?" he asked the empty air, feeling foolish but not caring. "Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? Who arranged all of this?"

Silence. The presence—if that's what it was—had withdrawn, or gone dormant, or simply decided that it had provided enough information for now. He could feel it at the edge of his awareness, like a door that had closed but not locked, but his attempts to open it produced nothing.

The cosmic equivalent of software with no documentation. Source code with no comments. He was expected to figure out the interface on his own.

"Fine," he said, to himself or to the unhelpful presence or to no one at all. "Working hypothesis: isekai scenario."

The word surfaced automatically, drawing from years of consumed media—anime and light novels and the particular subgenre of fiction where people died in their original world and woke up in new ones. Person dies. Person is transported. Person receives mysterious powers or helpful system interface or explanatory goddess who lays out the rules of their new existence. Adventures ensue.

He'd read enough of those stories to recognize the pattern he seemed to be living. But the pattern was incomplete. No status screen had appeared floating in his vision. No helpful voice was explaining the rules. No goddess had manifested to offer quests or assign objectives. There was only this: a field, a body, a handful of documents, and a presence that spoke in fragments and then fell silent.

"Status," he tried, focusing as hard as he could on the concept of a character sheet.

Nothing.

"Menu. Interface. System. Help."

Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.

Whatever had brought him here, whatever had reconstructed his body and established his life and placed him in this field of white chrysanthemums—it wasn't offering a tutorial. It wasn't explaining the rules. It had given him the bare minimum necessary to exist in this world and then left him to figure out the rest.

He stood in the chrysanthemums, thinking.

---

The name on his documents was Tsukino. 月野. Moon-field.

The characters were common enough in Japanese. He'd encountered them before—in his Kyoto years, in the manga he'd read to practice reading comprehension, in the cultural detritus that accumulated when you spent enough time engaging with Japanese media.

Tsukino.

The name snagged on something in his memory. A familiar association. A character he'd known since childhood, present in the cultural water supply the way certain stories and images just *were*, absorbed through osmosis whether you sought them out or not.

*Tsukino Usagi.*

His breath caught.

*Sailor Moon.*

He'd never been deep into magical girl anime—had watched a few episodes here and there, enough to understand the references, enough to know the broad strokes of the genre. Sailor Moon was unavoidable. Blonde girl with the odango hair and the speeches about love and justice. Transformation sequences. Fighting evil by moonlight. One of the most famous anime in history, translated into dozens of languages, referenced in everything from academic papers to Saturday Night Live sketches.

The protagonist's name was Usagi Tsukino.

Someone had given him that surname.

Sheldon almost laughed. The sound came out strange—half amusement, half something closer to hysteria. He was standing in a field in 1989, in a body that had been "reconstructed" by something that communicated in fragments, carrying documentation with a name from a cartoon.

*A cartoon about magical girls who drew power from celestial bodies. Who were protected by a queen named Serenity. Whose ultimate form, in the manga at least, was something called Sailor Cosmos—*

He cut the thought off before it could complete itself.

That way lay madness. That way lay the kind of pattern-matching that conspiracy theorists and sleep-deprived researchers fell into when they'd been staring at data too long. A shared family name meant nothing. Japan had millions of people named Tsukino. The fact that he'd been given documentation with that particular name was coincidence, or someone's idea of a joke, or—

Or it wasn't.

But he couldn't think about that. Not yet. Not without more data. He filed the observation away in the part of his mind that collected anomalies—the part that had spent four doctoral programs learning to notice patterns without forcing conclusions—and moved on.

---

*Baby, if you're going to think crazy thoughts, at least think them all the way through.*

His grandmother's voice, dry and practical.

Sheldon looked around. The field was empty. No one to see him make a fool of himself. No one to witness if he stood here and shouted anime attack names at the sky and nothing happened except the wind rustling through the chrysanthemums.

And if something *did* happen...

He closed his eyes. Reached for the memory of the warmth, that space between death and waking where something vast and kind had held him together. The wings. The chime-like resonance. The sense of being *seen* by something that operated on a scale he couldn't comprehend.

If he'd been given a name from that universe, if this wasn't coincidence but design, then maybe—

He felt ridiculous. He felt like a child playing pretend in the backyard, wielding stick-swords against imaginary dragons. He felt like every otaku who'd ever secretly wished the fantasy were real.

He raised his hand anyway.

"Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss."

The words left his mouth with the cadence of something half-remembered, syllables arranged in the particular rhythm of attack names from a dozen magical girl series. He didn't expect anything to happen. He'd chosen the most absurd, over-the-top, patently ridiculous attack he could remember specifically *because* nothing would happen, and then he could move on with his day secure in the knowledge that at least he'd checked—

Light erupted from his palm.

Not the controlled beam he half-remembered from the anime. Something rawer. Wilder. A cascade of golden-white radiance that tore through the air like a lightning strike, illuminating the field in colors that didn't have names, carrying with it a sensation of—

*Warmth. The same warmth. The wings, the presence, the vast compassion that had gathered his shattered pieces and made them whole again—*

The light cut off.

Sheldon's legs folded beneath him.

He hit the ground hard, shoulder first, rolling onto his back among the chrysanthemums while the sky spun lazily overhead. Every muscle in his body had gone slack, emptied of whatever force had been holding them together. His lungs worked in shallow gasps. His heart pounded with the desperate rhythm of a system pushed far beyond its limits.

---

He tried to move his hand. It twitched. That was all.

The white flowers swayed above him, indifferent to his condition, their petals catching the afternoon light with the same gentle beauty they'd displayed before he'd done something incredibly stupid. He lay among them like a corpse—*like he'd been when he woke up*, the thought arrived with hysterical humor—and stared at the sky while his body slowly, grudgingly, began to remember how to function.

That was real.

The thought circled through his oxygen-deprived brain, refusing to settle into any category that made sense. That was real. He had said words, ridiculous anime words, and light had come out of his hand, and now he was lying in a field unable to move because whatever energy that light had required, his body had possessed it and now did not.

He had magic. Or something like magic. Or access to something that behaved like magic when he spoke the right words in the right way.

He also, apparently, had approximately zero ability to control it.

Minutes passed. Five, maybe ten—he'd lost track, his awareness narrowing to the basic project of convincing his lungs to keep working and his heart to keep beating. Gradually, feeling returned to his extremities. Gradually, his muscles began responding to commands again. Gradually, the exhaustion shifted from "complete system failure" to merely "worst hangover of his life."

He sat up. The motion took three tries and left him dizzy.

The field looked exactly the same. No scorch marks. No evidence that anything unusual had occurred. If someone had been watching from the road, they would have seen a man stand in a field, raise his hand, and then collapse—strange behavior, certainly, but nothing that screamed *supernatural*.

Sheldon filed that observation away. Important. Whatever he could do, it didn't leave obvious traces. It could be hidden. It could be kept secret while he figured out what the hell he actually was and what rules governed this new existence.

Because he was going to keep it secret. That much was certain.

He didn't know what this world was—isekai, parallel dimension, elaborate afterlife, something stranger still. He didn't know who or what had placed him here, or why they'd given him a name that resonated with magical girl mythology, or whether the power he'd just accidentally unleashed was a gift or a test or a cosmic joke at his expense.

What he knew was this: he was alone in unfamiliar territory, with no allies and no information and no understanding of the rules. The last thing he needed was to advertise capabilities he couldn't control to people whose motives he couldn't assess.

*When you don't know the game, baby, you keep your cards close until you figure out who's dealing.*

His grandmother again. Always his grandmother, even now.

Sheldon got to his feet. The motion was no longer effortless—his body felt like it had been wrung out and hung up to dry—but he managed it. He swayed once, caught himself, and took stock of his condition.

Exhausted. Shaky. Functional, barely.

He could still walk. He could still reach the road, find people, ask questions. He would just do it more slowly than he'd planned, and he would keep the reason for his fatigue to himself.

He brushed dirt and grass from his slacks, straightened his shirt, and looked around with the systematic attention of a scientist surveying a new experiment.

The field stretched around him in a gentle slope, chrysanthemums and grass giving way to rice paddies below and forested hills above. The stone ruins were visible uphill, weathered and overgrown but somehow significant—he couldn't shake the feeling that this place *meant* something, that he'd been placed here rather than arriving randomly.

A road was visible in the distance, maybe five hundred meters downslope—a thin gray line cutting between agricultural fields, promising connection to the wider world. He would walk to it. He would find people. He would ask questions, carefully, presenting himself as a man with a cover story he'd just read in detail—the grieving son, the returning heir, the physicist on sabbatical. He would figure out what the Tsukino property looked like, meet the priest named Masaki, perhaps hire the roofer named Yamamoto.

He would breathe, and he would move, and he would take things one step at a time until he understood enough to take bigger steps.

*Live well.*

The impression surfaced in his memory—not the presence speaking now, but the echo of what it had said in that space between death and rebirth. Live well. Whatever had saved him, whatever had reconstructed his body and placed him here with a life and a family and a chance at something new—that's what it had asked of him.

He didn't know if he could trust that request. Didn't know if the presence was benevolent or manipulative or something beyond either category. But he knew what his grandmother would say about being given a second chance: *Don't waste it, baby. Don't you dare waste it.*

Sheldon took one last look at the chrysanthemums, at the castle ruins, at the field where he had been born into this new existence—and where he had learned, in the space of a few reckless seconds, that this new existence came with capabilities he did not understand and could not yet control.

Then he turned toward the road and started walking, slower than he would have liked, leaving the white flowers to keep whatever secrets they had been planted to guard.

Behind him, in the circle where he had stood and spoken words that shouldn't have meant anything, the chrysanthemums held their faces toward the afternoon sun. Their petals had taken on a luminosity that hadn't been there an hour ago—whites more vivid, yellows at their centers deeper and richer, the plants themselves standing fractionally taller than their neighbors at the field's edges. The difference was subtle. Someone would have to know what to look for, would have to have seen the field before and after, would have to understand that living things sometimes responded to energies that physics textbooks didn't acknowledge.

Sheldon, eyes fixed on the road ahead and mind cataloging more immediate concerns, did not look back.
